Subj:	ATARI GAMES 401-K PLAN


John Klein asked me to put the following memo out on junk mail:

TO:  All Employees

FROM:  John Klein/Dennis Wood

We are quite pleased to report that our 401-K Plan has gotten off
to an excellent start.  As of today we had 118 employees making
contributions to the Plan.

We encourage each employee not participating in the Plan to review
carefully whether or not you should consider making contributions
starting in January 1986.  Please keep in mind that Atari will 
provide matching funds at the rate of $.50 per dollar up to a 
maximum of $1,500.00 of Atari contribution.

If you have any questions about making a deferred or even a 
voluntary contribution to the 401-K Plan, please see either one 
of us.  We would be pleased to answer your questions.

Thank you for your cooperation in getting the Plan started in
1985.  We especially appreciated the timely manner in which the
various forms were completed.

	The front door will relock automatically at 7PM, not 8PM.
This is a permanent change.  The building will be cleared of all non-
Atari employees by 10PM each night.  Card access hours will remain unchanged
except for the hour between 7PM and 8PM.  During this time (in the near
future) access to the building will only be recognized at the front
lobby and west lobby sensors.  The sensor in the east lobby will be deactivated
between 7PM and 8AM.

	The east lobby door was not deactivated today, it was destroyed.
I have taken it apart and reassembled it the way it should have been; it will
now function as it should.  Please continue to let me know if there are
problems where the system doesn't work as it should.  I know I really don't
have to ask for your cooperation--I'm certain I'll be told.

There is a new version of the greenhills C compiler available for anyone 
who wishes to use it.

 Many bugs have been fixed, including the ROM relocation problem and the 
corrupt register problem.
 I have recompiled my game and it still works.
Apparently the code generation, and optimiser have been improved.

To use it assign ncc (or whatever) to:-

SYS$SYSDEVICE:[GREEN.1V7V22]CCOM.EXE

	If you find any problems let me know.

I've looked over the code and put some stuff in rpm to (hopefully) allow it
to work on tomcat hardware.
In [brad.tomcat]tomcat.lda is the ROM code (8000) for some tests.
It should look at the port (upon IRQ) and play sounds.
It probably won't work first time (it never does) but we can try it and see
what happens

Subj:	A new way to program...


We have a new EPROM programmer. This one is from a different company than
Data I/O so it does things a bit different than what you might be used to.
But fear not, it is quite a bit better. Although it doesn't program EPROM's
any faster than the DIO, it does everything else substantially faster.
It has 512k bytes of internal ram so you can program sets with up to
8 27512's (or 16 27256's). The maximum word size allowed is 128 bits
which ought to cover anything we'd do in the near future. It does not,
however, allow you to patch data from the keyboard (too bad, Ed and Bob).

I've setup a new command procedure to run it and you use it from any of
the terminals in the DIO room. The commands are the same as the one's
for the DIO except you start it up with:

	$ IMI			!instead of DIO

You only need to turn the unit on (switch is in back, upper right corner)
to activate it for computer (no Sel F1 Start required). After it does its
self-test, the message IMI 3016 appears in the window. If its already on,
and the START button is lit, then press it. If the button remains lit,
cycle the power on the unit.

There are no manufacturer codes required in this unit, so the DEVICE command
needs only the generic part name and I assume it means you can program mixed
vendor parts simultaneously. But you still need to watch out for 27128's and
27128A's! 

Each socket has an LED over it and this LED can either be off, glow red,
glow yellow or glow green depending on what the IMI is doing or has done.
Basically RED means the EPROM didn't program or verify properly or in the
case of set programming, indicates a missing part. Green means the EPROM
programmed or verified correctly and yellow or off means the socket is
not being used.

Set programming is done the same as with the DIO except the word size is
handled by the VAX not by the IMI. This means that the IMI always thinks
that the word size is 8, so if you peek into memory from the keyboard you
might not see what you think you ought to. The VAX scrambles the data words
during the download into sections the size of a single EPROM and loads them
into the IMI in the order that they appear in the input file. For example
assume a word size of 24 bits and an EPROM size of 1000 (hex):

	input file offset:	+0 +1 +2 +3 +4 ... +0FFC +0FFD +0FFE
	data appears at socket	 1  2  3  1  2         1     2     3
		"		 4  5  6  4  5         4     5     6
				      etc.

This is the same as what the DIO would do.

The IMI program does what is called a LOAD TEST before beginning programming or
verifying. This test checks that all EPROMS are properly loaded into their
sockets and if set programming, also checks that there are enough EPROMS to make
up at least one set. If either of these tests fail, then the program will
display what is needed on the terminal, light the LED's over the sockets to
which you must do something, turn on the START button and wait for you fix
whatever is wrong and press the START button. The tests are repeated each time
you press the lighted START button. 

If you are programming, the IMI program checks that all the EPROMS that are
loaded into the unit are blank. If one or more is not blank, then the red
LED over the non-blank part is illuminated, the START button is turned on
and the system waits until you load a blank EPROM and press the START button.
The blank test is repeated until is succeeds.

For the really advanced EPROM user, you can also dynamically change the
programming pulse time with a /PULSE=m[.n] command on the FILE or PROG command.
The maximum value is 50.9 milliseconds and the minimum time is 0.1 milliseconds.
The typical value for the older EPROMs (2732 and smaller) is upwards of 40
milliseconds. The 27256's and co. use a pulse time of about 4 milliseconds. If
you change the programming pulse, DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK! The data may be
programmed into the part so it'll verify but shortening the pulse time will also
shorten the lifetime of the data in your EPROM. That is to say, your data may
"erase" itself over a course of a few days. This may be acceptable for
development work where you re-program the EPROM's daily or weekly, but not so
hot for parts destined for a field test game or some such.

Subj:	Featured feature

	HOLD .vs. HANG ONTO

	There has been some (some???) confusion about exactly what HOLD is
and how long HOLD will HOLD for.  So, here goes:

	There are two kinds of hold on the system.  There is the star-nine
hold you heard about in class, and another kind you get automatically whenever
you FLASH.  The kind you ask for with a star-nine is called a hang up hold,
because after you ask for it you may hang up the phone.  The other kind is
called an off-hook hold, or flash hold, because if you hang up, the system will
KNOW that you forgot about the call (or how to get it back) because you didn't
say you wanted to hang up (i.e., it was not a hang up hold).

	Why are there two kinds?  Because when you flash, SOMETHING has to
happen to the call you were on, and it's not fair to assume that the call
will wait for five minutes or so, if you DO forget.  And it is neccesary
at times to put someone on hold for longer than a few seconds.

	Here's the timing info:  When you flash, you start a timer.
If you don't reconnect (star-one or CNCT) to the guy you were talking to,
or do something with or to him (like add him in on a conference call,
or transfer him, or park him somewhere, etc) before the timer gets to
35 seconds, the call will go to the operator.  If you hang up before this
time, your phone will immediately ring, and he will be treated as an incoming
call.  When you put someone on hangup hold, he will wait 75 seconds (a
minute and a quarter) before doing anything.  You can hang up, and he won't
bother you.  After that 75 seconds, he starts watching your phone; if it becomes
non-busy, he becomes an incoming call as before.  But if your phone stays
off hook, he gives up AFTER FIVE MINUTES (not 35 seconds) and goes to the
operator.

	Now a lot of people have complained that this isn't exactly the way
it works;  but there is a consistent explanation.  The button on an ETS marked
HOLD under the three lines is a flash hold, and not a hangup hold.  I think
that ROLM screwed up, and should have labelled it FLASH.  But it isn't exactly
a flash button either.  On single line phones (Rolm calles them FLASHPHONES[tm])
you can flash and then do things like report a bad line, or key in the code
for park and an extension;  you can do something WITH or ABOUT the other call.
On ETS's, you can't do that.  If you hit the HOLD button, you have FLASHed,
as you can tell by the series of tones, but you may as well be on a different
line; you can't affect the other call.  Also, if you change lines and come
back, you are automatically reconnected to your previous call--you don't get
the double tone of a call on hold, EVEN WITH A HANGUP HOLD.  This is also
more like the multi-button phones than like the single-line phones.

	You should know that PARKING a call on an extension is the same as
the call being placed on HANGUP hold by that extension.  It will wait 5 minutes
before going back to the operator.  But if you want to have someone wait longer
than half a minute, you MUST key in a star nine (hangup hold) or the call will
go to the operator.

	I am experimenting with ETS keyboard layouts.  MAIL (VAX or paper) any
suggestions to me.  I already plan on a minimum of PICK, SAVE, REPEAT, BAD LINE,
and if I can figure out how, hang up hold.  Suggestions could include names
for the hangup hold button (wait? hang on? ho-o-o-old? take 5? stall? thimk?
working...?  Not working?  toilet break?  Coffee break?  vacation?  Sabbatical?
Maybe you guys better come up with the name...)

	I know this feature was mostly aimed at the ETS users, but don't you
fret, you guys with the "simpleton" phones...  I'll get you too...

Subj:	pokey design for new systems


For new audio systems in the future PLEASE do not copy previous POKEY designs
like SYSTEM I and SYSTEM II
WHY?
'cause they are extremely too loud compared to the YAMAHA. The audio group
has to cut the volume for POKEY sound effects drastically to match with 
YAMAHA. Fortunately it's not too much a problem on SYSTEM II because of 
the mixers but on SYSTEM I the volume of the sound effects on POKEY 
operate on the low end of the scale and thus there isn't any range to 
work in.
During the design phase of SYSTEM I we tried to match the volume of the
two chips (YAMAHA and POKEY) with sample files that we had at the time.
Unfortunately we didn't have the extensive files and experience we have
now.
now for YAMAHA.
Thanx

Regarding volume levels for POKEY verses YAMAHA:

	The Gauntlet Audio design has come the closest to balancing
the volume levels on these two chips. But for added measure a MIXER
was employed so we could fine tune the balance. A MIXER comes in mighty
handy because some YAMAHA voices are very soft. Also RPM will automatically
change the volume of the sound chips to an individually pre-determined 
volume level whenever a TI VOICE command is requested. This allows for
more comprehensible speech.

Subj:	The IMI EPROM programmer


The people at IMI sent me some new program Eproms for the IMI with fixes for
some of the bugs that I told them about. I, in turn, fixed the VAX program
to compensate for their bug fixes and in the process, changed it a little.

1) It will now allow you to program partial sets.

2) Data downloads will go faster if you specify a fill character (default
   character is 00) that matches MOST of the data in the EPROM. The program
   pre-fills the RAM in the IMI with this fill character and won't download
   streams of 10 or more of those characters found in your input file.

Subj:	The Final Frontier


	I don't know about you, but I'm usually pretty cynical about tragedies.
I'm a little surprised to find this space shuttle thing triggering such an
emotional response.  I guess somehow I see the space program as some kind of
symbol of hope for the future of the human race, a sort of mirror opposite to
what is symbolized by the arms race.  At least these are missiles that aren't
supposed to blow up.  They seem to symbolize quest, exploration, cooperation,
transcendence.  And there seem to be a lot of people that come back from orbit
feeling somehow changed by the experience, by seeing the earth as a whole, a
blue oasis in space, without obvious national boundaries. 

	I don't know if this is an appropriate time to suggest this or not,
but I remember overhearing a number of Atarians in the past suggesting the
idea of some sort of space exploration game.  I feel that now that the video
game industry, at least for a while, has gotten past the stage of reinforcing
people's space war fantasies, it would be nice if we could go the next step
and encourage active participation in a guided fantasy of space exploration.
The thing that made the Star Trek series so great was its success at 
encouraging positive thoughts about the human spirit and our need for quest,
invoking an almost sacred aura around the mission to explore new worlds, to
boldly go where no man has gone before, etc.  There are limits to how much of
this atmosphere we can achieve in a video game, but it would be interesting to
explore these limits.

	I don't have any specific game idea to suggest.  It could be a
simulated space shuttle mission or the first manned flight to Mars.  It could
be a Voyager-like pass-by through the whole solar system.  It could be a
space-age Noah's ark, making its escape from Earth moments before the Last
War.  You could be controlling flight trajectories, docking with other ships,
using a simulated shuttle control panel, doing in-flight experiments using
remote-control arms, doing space walks, landing the ship, or whatever.  There
might be bad guys, there might not.  It would be nice if it were a multi-player
cooperative or cooperative/competitive game.  In general the way to do a
cooperative game has been to have the players cooperate in competing against a
common enemy (Rip-Off, Gauntlet, etc.).  It might be interesting to make the
common enemy the rigors of space, the difficulty of the mission itself. 
Different players could be working together in the ship, or piloting different
crafts, or whatever.

	Videodisk would've been ideal for using NASA footage to do great 
background visuals of planets, moons, and the Earth.  But whatever system
we might use, I'm sure we can develop evocative graphics and music appropriate
to the theme.

	Well, I just wanted to toss this out and see if anything bounces back.
If there seems to be sufficient interest, maybe we can have some brainstorming
meetings or something.  Maybe there's a game in here / out there somewhere, but
we won't know until we look.

Subj:	a bad day at the office


   I dont know about you, but I am usually cynical about people who
say they are cynical about tragedies! Everybody in this building knows
that Earl Vickers is completely insensitive to everything he can 
get his hands on. But he just loves to remind us all the time.
   The truth of the matter is that yesterdays explosion of the Challenger
spacecraft was a shock to everyone in this country (Except Earl Vickers).
I personnally felt quite a shock, for this time their were alot of people
including myself who were thinking how successful the shuttle has been
and how it began too look more and more like civilians would be taking the
trip more and more. Well this truely will happen someday, but yesterday,
just like in January of 1967, Our space program suffered a severe loss and
setback. And what about those people and students in Concord, New Hampshire
who now have to live with what they saw yesterday. I think you might
call it the sling-shot effect. They were quite que'd up with much 
excitement of seeing thier teacher going into space exploration, only to be
scorned within seconds by  Mr. DEATH. And of coarse this is not to forget
by any means the rest of the crew and their families. True these people
knew the risk involved. When there are tons of Liquid Hydrogen stored in
a "thin-skinned" tank that is twice the size of you, and this tank is strapped
to your belly, There is consderable risk. And true, where there is 
experimentaion there is always faliure of some sort. But NASA has done
well with the safety of there missions in the past. (obviosly not well enough
yesterday) But I think that evryone knew this was going to happen eventually
and it really is amazing to me that it hasnt happend alot more. Anyway,
to see a national tragedy right in front of your eyes is one thing, But
to see people vaporized as part of that national tragedy is another. And for
those people who have to live with the fact that thier husband or wife or 
mother or father have been taken from them only to know them now as 
"National Heros", Its got to hurt. Not to mention those children who really
are not old enough to understand. 
   Well I'm sorry, but I feel alot of sorrow over what happend yesterday.
It's not like we dont have enough troubles with that Jerk in Libya who
considers himself a fish beverage (Cod-coffee). The one thing this nation
is doing together, to  expand itself and reach out to the skies in a peaceful
(not including that Star Wars garbage) way, yesterday had to take a step
back.
   Salute to those 7 Americans who died for their country 10 miles above 
the Atlantic.

Subj:	An addendum to the appendix


	I don't mean to belittle the deaths of the 7 people yesterday,
but it seems to me to be one of the more minor tragedies of our times.
What really irks me is the public acceptance of the deaths of thousands
while they bemoan the deaths of a few, or the imprisonment of a few,
or the mistreatment of a few.  I am not known as a peacemonger, or
"nuke the nukes" freak, but I believe it is more of a travesty for
Time/Life books to use the deaths of hundreds of thousands (during VietNam)
to make a profit!  Watch for the commercials and see if you can eat 
afterwards. 

	I regret the deaths of those 7, and I empathize with their families,
but it is a bigger crisis when a jet airliner crashes in a shopping mall,
killing hundreds and leaving emotional scars on the witnesses for the rest
of their lives.  May all those who have to suffer such things recieve their
just rewards sooner.

   I must say that, after hearing from Earl, that I truely over-reacted
to his message and did not understand what he was trying to say. I 
therefore must apologize to him publicly for trying to slander his personality
for something he was not guilty. I now know he basically felt the same

Subj:	what I meant to say was...


	I just want to thank Chris for his apology, and to explain what it was
I meant to say the other day.  I can see how a misunderstanding like this can
happen, when people are expecting the black humor and bad taste with which my
name has apparently become synonymous. 

	What I was trying to say is that although I am usually cynical about
tragedies - there's only so much of it you can take from the media every day - 
that this was a total exception.  Tears were rolling down my cheeks the whole
time I was driving in to work.  It came as a total surprise to me that it
affected me this way - I'm not even that much of a space junky.  I was just in
shock the whole day.  And the reason seemed to be not just that 7 people had
died, though this was a big part of it - I wouldn't be upset over an unmanned
ship exploding - but it was also a sense of loss, like seeing your hopes and
dreams blow up. 

	And the point of the mail message was that I felt the last thing these
people who died yesterday would have wanted would be for the space program to
be cut back.  And I felt that something we could do in our own small way, as
kind of a tribute, would be to make a game that would help reinforce positive
fantasies about space exploration.  Maybe my timing was wrong, but I felt that
this was a time when all of our thoughts were focused on one thing.  I didn't
intend it in any sort of exploitive way.  I'm sorry if we view our work here as
such an insignificant and unimportant form of mindless entertainment that the
mail message could only be taken as some sort of sick joke.  I feel a need for
some kind of meaning in my work.  I don't mind if most of the games we make are
empty calories, but it would be nice if occasionally we could contribute
something, however small, to the culture.  I don't know what or how, but
something.

Yesterday, while talking to a new user, I realized that more of you might
like to use it. The following is a bit sketchy, but should let you decide
and get you running if you are interested.

	ADDRESS is a program which takes a name or list of names and
produces an address or list of same. For example, suppose you login.com
file contained the following:

$ ADDR*ess :== $ UTL$EXE:address -b Sys$Userdisk:[Albaugh]phone.lis

	Then if you typed:

$ addr albaugh

	you would get:
1)
Mike Albaugh
xxxxxxxxxxx
(xxx) xxx-xxxx

	You could similarly find anybody else on the "Atari Alumni et al"
mailing list. You DON'T need to get the name exactly right, although the
part of the program that attempts to match mis-spelled names doesn't know
about the silent 'g', so "alba" won't match but "albak" will. If you give
it more to work with, you have a better chance to match. "Mike Alba" does
work, for instance. If it can't find a "close enough" match, it will say
so, and also tell you the closest match it found. At present, you need to
re-try with that name, if it is the one you wanted. Some time that I have
some spare time I will try to make it a bit friendlier.
	Anyway, you can also just type:
$ addr
first name
second name
third name


	to get several names at once. or:
$ addr mike
	to get all the "mikes" on the list, or:
$ addr
mike
dave

	to get all the mikes and daves, etc.

	These multiple listings are actually more useful when the output
is sent to a file like so:

$ addr -o mikes.lst mike

	Which will put a list of mikes in the file mikes.lst.

	You can also get the list of names from a file, with:

$ addr -i names.lis

	Which will look in the file "names.lis" (a text file with one name per
line) and show you the corresponding addresses, or more usefully:

$ addr -i names.lis -o addresses.lis

	which you can probably figure out.

	When you get tired of looking up Atari Alumni, you can also change
the "book" you use:

$ addr -b mybook.lis fred smith

	will get the entry for Fred Smith from your own private address book.
This file contains entries in which the first line is the "name", to be
compared against the name you give ADDRESS, and the following lines, up to
the next blank line, contain the address, phone number, etc. Any line that
starts with a period will be ignored (to allow me to use .rno files). If the
first line ends in a hyphen, the second line will also be considered part of
the name. Also, the check for blank lines does NOT ignore spaces and tabs, so
if you really want to have a blank line within an entry, just use a line
starting with a space. Just take a look at the default "bookfile" (the
alumni phone list) to get the idea if you're still confused.

	When you get tired of typing your bookfile name all the time you can
do something like:

$ PADDR*ess :== $ UTL$EXE:address -b kim::[Albaugh.private]pphone.lis

	in addition to the original definition. Note the node-name, so I
can use the same file from any system. The alumni list is present on all
the Vaxim, but my private list is only on KIM. This makes it a little slow
but saves disk space and hassle. Incidentally, my KIM login.com defines
paddr without the kim::, because DecNet is to stupid to know when it is
already on kim and uses the net anyway if I use a node name.

	If you've gotten this far, I should warn you that this software is
category D support (we give you a phone number to call which is disconnected,
say, 555-1000). That is, I'll gladly READ complaints sent to KIM::Albaugh,
but do NOT guarantee timely response.

					Have fun,
					Mike

Subj:	Air Conditioning


During the past couple of weeks, I've been party to a couple
of meetings regarding HVAC - Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning.
Here are some miscellaneous details I've picked up:

1) Only exterior offices with windows have both heating and cooling
   ducts; interior spaces have cooling only; of course all areas get
   both indirectly as the system circulates air...(IF it circulates
   air - see below).

2) Until 2 weeks ago, the entire system was being monitored by an
   Energy Management System that was supposed to increase overall
   energy efficiency. The experts determined it was not working properly
   and turned it off. The noticeble side-effect of this seems to be that
   thermostats NOW seem to do something when you change the setting.

3) There are apparently a couple of different types of HVAC systems. One
   type continuously exchanges air in all parts of the building; since
   the fans are continuously running, this type is energy in-efficient.
   The other type of HVAC, the one we have, is more or less an 
   "on-demand" system. In other words, if the thermostat says everthing
   is o.k. the system will slowly shut-down air flow to the point where
   it is possible to have no air exchange at all.  This situation can be
   avoided or at least minimized by making sure that the rooms with the
   thermostats are not sealed off from the general working area and 
   working population.

4) Thermostat locations:
	Alpha Lab has 2:
		a) in Runner lab controling Runner, Police, TomCat and
		   half the central area.
		b) In Thrash lab controling Thrash, Relief, Gauntlet and
		   half the central area.
	Hardwall offices have 1 in Stempler's office controling Paauw,
		Theurer, Stempler, Salwitz, McCarthy, Ralston, Hally,
		Downend, Moore, Shepperd, Suttles, Albaugh, and Dawe.  

	Cubicle offices have 1 outside Paauw's office controling cube area.

	Common Area has 1 outside Downend's office controling Common
		area and Cyndy's cubicle.

	Proto Lab has 1 inside Proto lab controling Proto lab.
	
	LSI Lab has 1 inside LSI lab controling LSI lab.

	Dan's Office has 1 inside Dan's office controling Dan's office.

	Engr. Conf. Room has 1 inside Conf. Rm. Controling Conf. Rm.

5)There is a plan to break the Hardwall office system into 3 thermostat
	systems with
		Paauw, Theurer, Stempler, Salwitz, McCarthy on one Thermostat.
		Ralston, Hally, Downend, Moore on one thermostat.
		Shepperd, Suttles, Albaugh, Dawe on one thermostat.

6) Remote Override Switches
	There are huge "40-ton" HVAC units on the roof controling roughly
	one quarter of the building each. They are shut off at 6:00 PM
	weeknights until  8:00 AM (I think) the next morning. They
	are also shut off on weekends. The computers have separate
	24-hr/day 2-ton units. If you are here during an "off" period
	and the air-temp is unbearable you can turn on one of these
	40-ton HVAC units by cycling the "remote override" switches
	located throughout the building. These switches must be turned
	from "off" to "on" to activate the HVAC unit.

	SWITCH LOCATIONS:
		1)Outside Paauw's office - controls Alpha lab and the
		  the rest of the back quarter of the building.
		2)Outside Shepperd's office - controls Alpha Office space and
		  the rest of the front quarter of the building.

	Once this switch is cycled the HVAC unit will be activated 
	for one hour. PLEASE USE GOOD SENSE WHEN TURNING ON THESE
	40-TON UNITS!

That's all for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
P.S.
	RE: Phone System
	I understand that the front lobby switch board is "shut-down"
	at 5:00 PM when Evelyn leaves. Therefore, DO NOT expect 
	your unanswered calls to get forwarded to the lobby so you can
	be paged - after 5:00 PM.

	Dave S. says they plan to install a "night bell" so that
	unanswered calls forwarded to the lobby will sound a tone
	in the Intercom system; then anybody can answer it with
	the appropriate key strokes on any phone...

Subj:	HELP!!  (Bad line reporting)


	It has become apparent during the last week that the phone system
has a problem with one of the incoming lines.  An outside call rings your
phone, and when you answer it, it sounds like someone is there, but they
say nothing.  No matter what you do to convince them to talk, they sit there
and wait.  Eventually, they hang up.  Soon after, they call again, and
comment that they had a problem getting through.  More than one person
has logged this complaint.

	Here's what I beleive happens:  They dial the number, and the
phone company connects it to the Rolm system.  The Rolm system rings
your phone, and tries to send a ringing tone to the caller.  Somewhere
along the line, the transmission of sound of any kind from the Rolm
switch to the caller is blocked.  You answer your phone, because it is
ringing, and the same thing happens--they hear nothing.  They sit there
waiting for the phone to ring, and eventually decide that the call didn't
go through.  So they try again.
	
	So, we either have a bad trunk line from the phone company, or
we have a bad trunk card.  Unfortunately, we have 40 incoming trunks.
In order for me to tell which card/line pair is suspect, I need your help.
When this happens, (you get a call from someone who can't tell you are there),
please FLASH and dial *563.  This must be done before you revert to dial tone.
It can be done just after they hang up, but you must be quick about it.
ETS users don't have to FLASH, and some of you have BAD LINE buttons, which
do the same thing.

	What this does for me, is make an entry in a short list of complaints,
which will tell me the extension, the time of day, and the trunk line.  When
I get more than one complaint with a given thing in common (like trunk line),
then I know where to start looking, and I can clear it up.  Up until then, we
will have to put up with ghost callers (or whatever the current problem is)
or pull off each of the 40 lines until the problem is found.

	By the way, BAD LINE does not just apply to ghost callers.  Anytime
you have a complaint about the quality of a call, FLASH *563.  We can fix
noisy (hissing) lines, lines with other people talking on them, etc, if we
can tell the telephone company which trunk is giving us the problem.  It would
be a big help if you could drop me a note when you report a bad line letting
me know the time and extension you were at, and what the complaint was about
(hissing is one thing, ghost callers is another).

	Thanx in advance for all your help.

Subj:	MicroEmacs text editor


A public domain EMACS is available in [brad.microemacs].
This version of EMACS has most of the common commands found on the high-priced
EMACS, - search, multiple windows, buffers, spawning etc.. It can be defined
for AMIGA, ST 520, CP/M, VMS, UNIX V (maybe more, but I can't remember). I
can't speak for the other OSs but all commands that are in the brief
documentation (kim::[brad.microemacs]m_emacs.doc) work under VMS. Please try it
out and tell me if you find any bugs. Better yet, port it over to your machine!
(especially if you have a 520 cuz I'd like a copy for myself!).
The entire source code in C, makefile and executable version reside in the
directory. ED.H is the header file that is used to define your
machine/environment

If you would like to try it out, define this in your login.com:

    EMACS :== $ SYS$USERDISK:[BRAD.MICROEMACS]M_EMACS

(by the way I'm on KIM::)


My initial reactions of MicroEmacs:

It works so far
It seems to be pretty fast (that is with a VAX, I don't know what will happen
     using a micro)
I like multiple windows
I like the thought of having the SOURCE and adding features that I like
I like being able to call DCL (create an interactive shell) from the editor,
     doing a directory, copy or mail, for instance, then going
     back to the editor where I left off!
I like having ONE editor that resides on MANY machines so I don't have to
     relearn everytime I go to another machine
I'm familiar with EMACS, it might take the unfamiliar some time getting used to.


Documentation is terse. I should (so they tell me) be able to obtain
     better doc later.
The documentation is suitable for printing on one of the LQ printers
     [brad.microemacs]m_emacs.doc

This product has no guarantee but please let me know if you find any bugs.
Not that I would/could fix them but I will post any problems/updates to people
that are interested. If you would like to know of any updates or other info
on MicroEmacs please send me your name and if there is enough interest
I'll create a mailing list.

Subj:	Are you wondering if your MAIL messages are getting read?


      A while ago I had asked Dave Shepperd about having a MAIL program capa-
 bility of knowing whether a recipient has read an important message you have
 sent.  Apparently lots of other people across the country using VAXes have
 also asked for this feature.  No one can implement this feature because of
 the MAIL file protection system: only Digital Equipment can change its
 software.

      Unfortunately, Digital's official answer is:

      "The ability to inform a sender when a message is actually read
      is a very contentious issue, since many individuals would consider
      this to be an unacceptable invasion of privacy.  Thus, there are
      no plans to implement such a feature in VMS MAIL."

      On the other hand, Digital says they are "investigating producing" new
 MAIL software that would "probably" have message trace capability.  Sounds
 like a lot of vaporware.

      Dave told me the best he can offer you is the capability of seeing how
 many new unread mail messages that the recipient has.  You can check for
 such information on anyone on our DECnet.

      At the operating-system level, type the following:

                           $  MCR CHKMAIL username

 If the recipient is on another VAX, put the node name immediately ahead of
 the name with double colons, as in:

                         $  MCR CHKMAIL KIM::username

      The response at your terminal will be:

         "User JOHNDOE on node WHATEVERVAX has __ new mail messages."

 If the user has no unread MAIL messages, you will get no response on your
 terminal other than the usual $ prompt.

      The only fly in the ointment is CHKMAIL's inaccuracy: at the moment you
 use this command, the recipient may have already read your important message
 and may have just received some other new MAIL message(s).  The only guaran-
 tee of the user having read your message is when you get no response on your
 terminal.  Anyway, good luck using CHKMAIL.
                                                    Andrea

Alright folks, I got the scoop from our friendly local electrician...
I, too was a bit curious about motion sensors in the showers.  I thought,
maybe water conservation; you know, when you stopped moving around in the
shower, the water automatically shut off (or maybe set off an alarm to
warn others that you had passed out under water after a long run).
Well it's really nothing all that newsworthy.  There will be motion sensors
in all of the restrooms (not just the showers).  When the restroom is
unoccupied for 10 minutes, the lights will automatically shut off in order
to conserve energy (of course this could happen if you remain very still
in the
room also!)

Anyway, according to my sources the job will not be finished until
sometime tomorrow.

STATUS UPDATE - 2/86 - CONFIDENTIAL!!! ARARI EYES & EARS ONLY.

- ACME show is next week; Friday thru Sunday; 3/7-3/9/86.
  	-Atari will show: Super Sprint, Gauntlet, Temple of Doom, Robo Soccer.
	-Van Elderen, Moore, Tacakichi, Weatherby, Turner, Drobny, Hally, Logg, 
	 Arita are going from Engineering.
	-They leave Thursday morning.
	-Nakamura and 2 Namco Engineers will attend the show.
- Tentative production quantities of Super Sprint have been agreed upon -
	see me if you really want to know...
- Beginning Monday the factory will stop building games for a 3-5 week period.
  12 employees will stay on full-time; 43 will be furloughed. This was a 
  tough decision, but I think it's wise; When Sales volume has peaks and
  valleys; the production volume has to follow - it hurts in the long term
  to keep the factory running and build to inventory. Apparently, the
  furlough package was well-received by manufacturing employees.
- We have purchased a new improved VTI package for custom I.C. layout.
  This gives us a standard-cell library based on 2-micron CMOS as
  well as gate array and full custom layout ablility. All the support tools
  are included too.
- Japanese Yen: dollar is weak; 6-12months ago was 250 yen to dollar; now 180
  yen to dollar. This is hurting PCB kit dealers in USA since profit margin
  has been erroded - thats good for us - less competition.
- Nintendo is expected to introduce Super Mario Bros. on their VS Coin-op
  system at ACME. Its been a HOT game in Japan on the Home computer and
  at the usual $200 Nintendo kit price, its expected to do very well in the
  USA. Nintendo apparently lost money last year in the US coin-op market,
  and is expected to pull out of the coin-op market entirely...within 12 months?
  They already have in Japan - they are concentrating on their VERY
  succesful Home Computer/game console.
- SEGA is expected to introduce 4 new games at ACME: Space Harrier (not really
  new), Major League Baseball, Quartet (4-player Gauntlet rip-off but not
  nearly as good); and one other.
- Bally Sente is expected to introduce a new game too...rumor has it that
  Owen Rubin is feverishly working on this one.
- Exidy is in Chap. 11 and with the president (Kaufman) recovering from
  illness, they do not appear to pose a threat.
- Data East seems to have fallen off their high horse (Kung-Fu etc); with
  not much to offer...maybe they have a surprise for us at the show. The
  strong yen will hurt them too since all their product is licensed from Japan.
- Williams will probably introduce the new Steve Ritchie Pinball game. Its
  supposed to be great. It was ready for AMOA, but they held off cause they
  had a very good pinball in production...The name High Speed is in my mind,
  thats either Ritchies, or the one they just finished. I have no idea what
  the production run on a good pinball is these days...maybe someone going
  to the show can pump Ritchie...
- Market still looks weak, but Atari is positioned VERY well with respect
  to the competition.
- Nakamura and troops will be here week of 3/10-3/14; expect tours and
  show n' tells; will be a good time to find out details about System I
  Cocktail implementation issues...IF we have our ducks lined up. Please
  think about questions, and how to present the questions clearly considering
  the language barrier.
 - Bob Stewert (Mfg. Mgr) will be bringing a group of 6-8 ace PCB techs
   thru for a tour... I would like to show them Gauntlet,Roadrunner,Thrasher 
   Labs. I would like to also go over the game development process 
   using Gauntlet as an example. 
 - let me know if VAX mail like this is sufficient, or if you would rather
   have a group meeting where questions/answers could be exchanged.

Subj:	SYSTEM 1 GAMES: IDENTIFICATION BYTE - UPDATE 2/86


All System I games are required to initialize a byte in the
configuration area (Addr. 1006E specifically) to a certain value.
The utility system on the main board interrogates this byte to
determine if a new game cart has been installed and clears the
EEROM accordingly. For more information see the documentation
file on the VAX at KIM::DRA0:[SYSTEM1.DOC]SYSTEM1.DOC.

The following values for the byte at 1006E have been assigned.
All new System I games should contact Cyndy Grossman (X1734) for
assignment of a number.

           Diagnostic Cart:   255
           Pack Rat:          00
           Marble Madness:    01
           Temple of Doom:    02
           Road Runner        03

Subj:	CERROR


TPU and GREENHILLS C users:

A new TPU/EDT function has been added to TPU and I need your help to see if
it works. At the moment this function only works for those of you that use
the GREENHILLS C compiler (if enough people scream for it 'cerror' could be
modified to accept error files generated by different compilers or
assemblers). The new function is called: 
	
	cerr*or [filename][.err]

and is invoked on the TPU/EDT command line (GOLD_KP7).  'cerror' reports
errors that have occurred during compilation. It does this by first reading
in a file (to another buffer) that contains the errors and then searching
that file for line numbers where the errors occurred. The file search will
default to your working directory and if a file is not specified will look
for a file that matches your current edit file that has an extension of
.err. You may also specify a file on the command line. 

For example; after typing GOLD_KP7, you type

	cerr

at the TPU/EDT command line, 'cerror' will look in your current directory for
the filename that matches the file that you're editing (the main_buffer's
file) with an extension of .err. 

	'cerror' will then look for the first occurrance of an error,
display that error in the message window (bottom of screen), and move the
cursor to the line where the error occurred. To find subsequent errors it's
best to bind a key to the function. I suggest using the PF2 key. Therefore
add this line to your tpu$init file: 

baf$x_error_next := 'define_key("baf$error_next(current_direction)",pf2)';

By hitting the PF2 key you can find the next error. 'cerror' will also work
in the REVERSE direction. 

You must have an error file that was created by the GREENHILLS compiler. You
can obtain this file by redirecting GREENHILLS error reporting to a file. I
do this by adding this to my MAKEFILE.:

myfile.ol : myfile.c 
	$ assign/user myfile.err sys$error
	$ ncc -O -Z29 myfile.c

KNOWN BUGS:

	* If you call 'cerror' more than once, TPU will report an error.
	* 'cerror' does not know if you have edited your source file. So
	  if your error correction involved deleting or adding more 
	  or less than what you started out with, the next error reported will
	  be off by that many lines. (you could edit starting from the bottom
	  but most C errors occur because of the first one)

NAKAMURA, OUR FEARLESS LEADER AND OWNER OF THE COMPANY THAT MOSTLY
OWNS ATARI WILL BE HERE MONDAY AND TUESDAY 3/10-3/11. THERE ARE
NO FIRM PLANS, BUT PLEASE PLAN ON TOURS ETC.
 
Now, the Japanese are a traditional people and have a lot of 
ritual in their business affairs. Therefore, it would be courteous
for us to tone down our western ways where appropriate.

	1) Let's tidy up our labs and offices - if Rofo can do it, anybody
	   can.
	2) On Monday and Tuesday let's make an effort to dress conservatively
	   in spite of the fanstatic weather we have been having.
	3) Let's leave gym clothes in the locker room.

Maybe I'm overreacting, but I'm proud of the Atari Engineering group and its 
product, and I want Nakamura be proud too...I don't want him to be distracted 
by the cultural differences and miss the product.

Subj:	Micro EDT/TPU Editor

There now exists an editor which works very much like EDT with a few TPU 
like window control functions and a lot of EMACS window control functions.

At the moment this works for VMS (but TPU is a lot better), and on CPM68K 
(omni-byte) boards.

The source can be re-compiled to work on MSDOS (IBM) and with a little work 
(which I shall probably be doing in the near future) ATARI 520.

So if you need an EDT type editor for your system see me.

			Jim.


Following is a preliminary DOC file for this editor. Skip if you are not
interested.

EDMAC uses EDT keypad commands, just like EDT except for the following:-

No help Key.
No page command (Keypad 7).	- search for ^L instead.
No command (Gold Keypad 7).	- use emacs commands.
No fill (Gold Keypad 8).	- use ^X F to set wrap column
No replace (Gold Keypad 9).

Additional keypad functions:-

Gold I		- Splits screen in two and reads in a file to upper window.
Gold W		- Toggles between split screen and full screen.
Gold UP		- Goes into included window.
Gold DOWN	- Goes into main window.
Gold L		- starts a learn sequence.
Gold R		- terminates a learn sequence.
PF2		- executes the learned sequence.
Gold =		- show cursor position.
Gold !		- spawn command (VMS only).
Gold S		- spawn cli (VMS only).


The EMACS key sequences retained are:-

                              WINDOW CONTROL

^X 1		display only current window
^X 2		split current window (multiple window are permitted)
^X N		move to Next window
^X P		move to Previous window
^X Z		enlarge current window by one or repeat count lines (^U)
^X ^Z		reduce current window by one or repeat count lines (^U)
^X ^N		scroll current window up one or by repeat count lines (^U)
^X ^P		scroll current window down one or by repeat count lines (^U)


                               FILE CONTROL

^Z		save file in current buffer and exit
^X ^C		Exit without saving buffers.
^X ^R		Read a file into current buffer
^X ^S		Save current buffer into its file
^X ^V		Visit a file. Read file and display in current window
^X ^W		Write buffer to file
^X ^F		changes current buffer's filename to argument


                              BUFFER CONTROL

^X B		prompt for new Buffer
^X ^B		show active Buffers
^X ^K		Kill a buffer

                                DELETING

<esc> L		Lowercase next word
<esc> U		Uppercase next word
^X ^L		Lowercase selected region
^X ^U		Uppercase selected region


                                 MISC

TAB		tabs to set tab, to set tab do GOLD <arg> TAB, where arg is new tab stop.

Subj:	VAXMDM


Ok all you VAX MODEM fans.
This little utility (and if you don't know what it is, you probably
don't want to) is now available in UTL$EXE.
Do the following to use it:-

$ VAXMDM:== $UTL$EXE:VAXMDM.EXE

It allows aborting by ^X now and the command file is no longer needed to
run it.

Please use this new version, if you are currently using the old one.

A repeat of the help documentation follows.
Delete now if you are not interested.

VaxModem is a version of the common Xmodem found on RBBS/RCPM systems.
It allows uploading and downloading to/from the Vax when dialing in.
It is useful for anyone who has the equivalent Xmodem or modem7 etc program
on their system at home. Or any system that uses the (standard?) Ward 
Christensen protocol. (SOH,SEC,COMPSEC,128data,crc).

This program will allow transfer of text files or binary files, and can use 
either CRC or checksums.

It is run by either typing VAXMDM and waiting for the command prompt, or
typing the command and filename on the command line.

$ VAXMDM ?		This will give a limited help message.

$ VAXMDM s file.dat 	This will open the Binary file file.dat on the vax 
			and send it to your system.

$ VAXMDM sa file.src	This will open the text file (Variable length CR), 
			file.src on the vax and send it to your system.

$ VAXMDM r file.dat	This will create the Binary (fixed length 128 byte)
			file file.dat on the vax and receive data from your 
			system using CRC.


$ VAXMDM rc file.dat	This will open a binary file file.dat on the vax and 
			receive data from your system, it will expect a
			a checksum.

Note the c option is only effective for the receive command. It will tell
the sending program to use CRC or checksum.

The program will prompt you with a message similar to the following:-

receiving file file.dat in binary using CRC
Hit control X slowly a number of times to abort

After getting this message start the transfer, for your machine.
Typing control X (usually once) will abort VAXMDM.


Install it by:-

$ VAXMDM:== $UTL$EXE:VAXMDM.EXE

		Any problems, let me know.

Subj:	EPROM's and the IMI


There was a rumor floating around that the IMI EPROM programmer passed 
an EPROM that the DIO failed. I'd like some confirmation of this and
sample parts if possible. I spoke to the designer of the IMI yesterday
to see if he's heard of this happening before. He said no, but it has
happened where the IMI fails a part that the DIO passes.

To clarify what the IMI does on verfiy, it grounds the OE and CE lines
(enables the chip for DC reads) and reads the EPROM by changing only
the address lines. The DIO wiggles the OE and/or CE lines in-between
each byte read (one of the reasons it is so S-L-O-W). The IMI verifies
the part at 5v only not at 4.75 and 5.25 as the DIO does. The part is
loaded with a resistor (10k I think) and it is unkown how the DIO loads
parts. 

Whichever programmer you use to make master EPROM's, you must check those
parts by inserting them in a working game board before placing your stamp
of approval on them. Neither the DIO nor the IMI will check the EPROM for
correct access time. A working game board performs a more comprehensive
test than either programmer.

So you thought that the EPROM's were static ROMs, well read on...

He told me of a bug that is present in a number of EPROMS, especially the big
ones (27256 and up) where if the OE or CE lines are not changed in an
unspecified period of time (its a bug, remember), all outputs will go to 0 and
stay there, perhaps because the output drivers are more dynamic in nature than
static. In any case, beware (he mentioned AMD as a major culprit). He also
mentioned that the EPROMS are VERY sensitive to the voltage on the Vpp pin. If
it is not exactly what it is spec'd to be, the outputs may oscillate.

Subj:	Audio Stuff


Pat,

	If you are going to design a new Sound Procesor System you
might want to consider some of the things I have done on TomCat.

   1. The TMS 5220C can be reset by bringing /WS and /RS down (and up)
at the same time. Therefore, it does not require a transistor switch 
to remove -5V from the IC. (TMS 5220C is Atari p/n 137308-002.)

   2. The TMS 5220C Clock input will accept an almost TTL level if you tie 
PROUT to +5v. (You must use a pullup resistor on the CLK input so it will go 
up to VSS.) The clock frequency must then be half what it would otherwise be, 
so that for example, 8 KHz sampling requires a 320 KHz clock. 

   3. At Earl's request I designed into it the capability of having the
software be able to select the TMS 5220C Clock frequency so it can
handle 8 KHz or 10 KHz sampling at the programmer's choice.

   4. In order to accomodate more speech memory I have put together a
Sequential Memory. The programmer writes to a location to set the
starting address. There is another location that reads the data thus
selected. Every Read increments the Sequential Memory address. I have
implemented 64K bytes of Sequential Memory (in two 26256's) in addition 
to 32K bytes of Program memory and 8K bytes of RAM. (An 8K x 8 RAM takes
up less board space than two 2k x 8's.)


The above should not be considered an endorsement of the idea of having
a separate Universal Audio PCB.

Subj:	New IMI and DIO feature


Due to popular request, I've added a new feature to the IMI and DIO procedures.
You can run these jobs from a command file now to reduce the tedium in typing
in DEV, FILE, PROG, etc. On the second and subsequent PROG or VERIF commands,
it'll pause waiting for you to type CR presumably after you've changed the
EPROM's.

There's two ways to call these procedures from a .COM file, one is to simply
place your DIO/IMI commands as arguments (maximum of 8):

	$ IMI "DEV 27512" "FILE game.hex 16" "PROG 0-7FFFF" "LOGOUT"

You need the double quotes around the arguments if there are spaces in them.
If the first character in an argument is an atsign (@), then the argument is
assumed to be the name of a file containing more DIO/IMI commands. The
assumed file type is .COM and you can put into that file any IMI/DIO commands
one per line just as you would type them in. As in the above example:

	$ IMI "@FRED"

where FRED.COM contains:

	DEV 27512
	FILE game.hex
	PROG 0-7FFFF
	LOGOUT

You can have multiple commands/files on the command line:

	$ IMI "@FROBOZ" "@FRED" "DEV 27512" "FILE GEEK" "P 0" "EXIT"

If you don't include an EXIT in the command stream, then the command file
will not terminate, and will instead continue to prompt you for additional
commands (just as though you called IMI or DIO with no arguments). This
is useful if you just want to setup the IMI/DIO but then want to do the

Rick, These are the questions I have about the AMI Gate Array for the
Vector Generator (Atari p/n 137179-001) and about their letter
of 4/3/86:


A. Will the new part be compatible with the old part? I mean electrically,
mechanically, pin-for-pin compatible?

B. What do we get for our money? 

For Option I: 

  1. What do they do and what do we do? 

  2. How is "J flow tooling and manufacture in 5 micron technology" different 
     from the technology used in the old part? 

  3. They indicate that they are going to scrap this part too. When?

For Option 2:

  1. What do they do and what do we do? Do I just hand them a schematic and 
     they do the rest fot $13.5K ?
 
  2. If, as I suspect, their advice to "Design complete circuit from scratch"
     means "Atari designs complete circuit from scratch" how is this to
     be accomplished? Are they going to provide us with a complete CAD system,
     at no cost to Atari, or will we have to pay for it? And how much? And
     who is going to work on my game while I am designing the Gate Array? 

  3. If Atari bears the cost for redesigning this part why in the world would
     we choose AMI, a company that has already screwed us once? (And on the
     same part.)

C. Pricing:

     The way their prices are listed, if we were to go with Option I and
buy 15K would we pay $5.50 each for 5K (the First 5K) and $5.25 each for 10K 
(The Next 10K) or would we pay $5.25 each for $15K ?

     Either they are using a nonstandard method of quoting prices or they
are using a language other than English. Perhaps they are using AMI English.

Subj:	BLISS 16 bugs


The bug that Dennis found the other day is actually related to the AND operator.
The AND will screw up predictably and even more seriously than what was
happening to Dennis. To wit: 

	EXTERNAL ARRAY : VECTOR [,BYTE];
	LOCAL TEMP:UNSIGNED BYTE;
	TEMP = 7;	
	ARRAY[0] = .ARRAY[2] AND .TEMP;

Generates the following code:

	MOV #7,R0		;TEMP
	MOV ARRAY+2,ARRAY+0	;This is a real GEEK thing to do
	COM R0
	BICB R0,ARRAY+0

Notice that not only does it incorrectly generate a word move from what might be
an odd address, but it stomps all over ARRAY+1. This problem only seems to
happen when using an AND operator and when the operands are addresses of bytes.
If TEMP is declared as a word then it generates the correct code. Both the
current compiler (v4.1) and the new one (v4.2) do exactly the same thing in this
instance. At the moment, I have no recommended solution to this problem.
(Patient: Doctor, Doctor, it hurts when I do this! Doctor: Well, don't do that;
That'll be fifty bucks, please.) 

If you want to try the new compiler, do:

	$ set command utl$mac:bliss042

which will make subsequent compiles use the v4.2 compiler. If you want v4.1
back, logout and back in again.

I am going to a meeting 4/16 @10:00AM that is to be a final wrap-up session
of our air-conditioning problems.

"Cal Air has stated that all the problems from our last meeting have been
worked out and that our A/C system is acceptable."

Notably, at the last meeting I brought o
up the issues of: 1) Loud vibration in Jed's old lab; 2) Cold/hot spots in
Alpha-labs; 3) Sporadic function in the Hard wall office wing. 

I also mentioned that air-exchange seemed to be generally marginal.

Please let me know if you have any complaints regarding those issues as well
as any that have surfaced recently.

Subj:	Just browsing?


There is a new utility available on the system.  It is a text browser which 
allows you to examine random points in a source file (i.e., somewhere between
"TYPE" and "EDIT/READ_ONLY").  So why use it rather than "EDIT/READ_ONLY"?
For now, only a couple of reasons.  First, it's a wee bit faster than the 
editor, and uses fewer sytem resources (big deal, you say).  Second, it 
supports the concept of bookmarks.  You can quickly access any of 5 places in 
the text with a single keystroke.  This is NICE when you want to switch 
quickly among several places in the text, and want a full screen of
information in each place.

The program is called "VU".  You need to define the following symbol 
(probably in your LOGIN.COM) to use it:

	$ vu :== @utl$com:vu

Then you can call it by:

	$ vu textfile

where "textfile" is any non_ambiguous_file_spec.  No switches are supported at
this time. 

The command structure is very similar to EDT keypad mode cursor functions, with 
the editing and character oriented stuff removed.  Additionally:

	RETURN		forward 22 lines
	LINE FEED	backward 22 lines
	SPACE BAR	forward a line
	BACK SPACE	backward a line
	GOLD a thru	Set the associated bookmark at the
	  GOLD e	  current cursor postion
	a thru e	Go to bookmark A thru E
	Control-Z	exit

You need a CIT-101 or equivalent to run it properly.  It does nasty things 
with files that aren't variable CRLF or stream-LF.  If you need to look at 
runoff documents, you will want to use "RVU" instead:

	$ rvu :== @utl$com:rvu

Please send questions, comments, bug reports and suggestions (which are likely
to be ignored) to KIM::RAINS.

to be bothered with softball game or party announcements or the like can simply
have his/her name deleted from the list. THEREFORE... messages that are actually
significant to the operation of the company should NOT be sent to JUNK, but to
the people actually concerned with the message in question. There is a list
EVERYBODY, but it is protected from casual use, as there are VERY few messages
that need to go to literally everybody (e.g. building closing or computers
down). If you think you have such a general-interest message, see me or one of
the other system folk.

	Hope I didn't come off too uptight, but there has been a whole lot of
non-trivial traffic on junk lately and some important messages could be missed.

Please come to a meeting - we need to resolve an issue:

MEETING: DO WE WANT "REMOTE SENSE" ON SWITCHING SUPPLIES?
WHEN:    4/23/86 @ 1:00 PM
WHERE: CENTRAL CONF. ROOM

Currently, we specify remote sense as a requirement on switching supplies.
All 5V, 10A switchers procured have met the requirement - although I don't 
think we used it (Pat can confirm this). TX-1 used a switcher from LH 
Research - did we use remote sense on it?

The problem is that we are currently using 5V, 15A switchers in Super Sprint
and no manufacturer has anything with remote sense in our price range. We
have bought 2000 from Sierracin without remote sense on a deviation basis.

QUESTION: If we are NOT going to use remote sense, do we want to pay the 
          extra cost for it?

QUESTION: If we ARE going to use remote sense (and you'll have to convince me 
	  of that), is the benefit worth the extra cost in our application?

In my relatively naive approach, I see our supplies situated physically close
to the logic PCB's and I see our current load as being fairly steady. Given
that situation, remote sense seems unnecessary. The VIRTUE of remote sense
seems to be that our factory will NOT have to check and adjust 5V manually 
(assuming remote sense is connected to the 5V output at the supply).
This is not insignificant given the transitory nature of our production line
workers.

SVUSERS		System V users
MFG		Manufacturing and Customer Service
PURCH		Purchasing
CUSTSVC		Customer service
FINANCE		Finance and Accounting

Use @SYS$MAIL:list in reply to MAIL's "To:" prompt to send a message to the
people on the list. (@SYS$MAIL:JUNK for example). If you're on a list and you
don't want to be, send mail to KIM::COMPLAINT and your name will be removed.

If you want to know who is on a specific list, type: 

	@UTL$COM:WHOSONIT list

where "list" is the mail list you're intrested in. This might take a minute or
two to complete. (I.E. @UTL$COM:WHOSONIT ENGINEER to find out who's on the
ENGINEER list). The contents of any list are subject to change without notice.
Ignore the underscore in the names (I.e. KIM::_SHEPPERD = KIM::SHEPPERD). 

If you want to keep the report, you can type:

	@UTL$COM:WHOSONIT list filename

which will place the report into a file named "filename" (default file
type = .LIS) so you can print it out later. For example:

	@UTL$COM:WHOSONIT FINANCE FIN

will place the names of the people on the FINANCE mail list into a file named
FIN.LIS.

Subj:	new trakball Ic


You may have seen a data sheet circulated recently for a Mouse 
interface IC from NEC, the uPD4701c.
This chip may be used for a single Trakball / dual steering wheel 
interface in place of the LETA chip. It accepts the same type of 
Quadrature signals that our optical coupler produces and counts all 
four phases of the quadrature signal (same as Leta Hi resolution 
mode).

Main Advantages of the uPD4701 :
No CPU wait states required.
No clock required.
12 bit accuracy.

Main disadvantages :
Only one Trakball (= 2 steering signals) per IC.

Costs :
$3.50 @ 5K, $2.75 @ 10K, $2.25 @ 20K

Last known cost on LETA was $2.60 @ qty unknown.

For more Information on the uPD4701C contact Erwin in componemts.

Subj:	Bliss bug # 1


Awhile ago someone reported a BLISS-16 bug where the compiler was generating
word mode references to an array of bytes. I isolated the bug to the use of
the AND operator and sent in an SPR to DEC. Here is the text I sent them:

"There is a problem with the AND operator when the operands are addresses of
bytes as demonstrated with the following code fragment:

MODULE BUG (ENVIRONMENT(T11), ADDRESSING_MODE(ABSOLUTE)) =
BEGIN
    EXTERNAL ARRAY : VECTOR [,BYTE];
    GLOBAL ROUTINE BUG1 : NOVALUE =
	BEGIN
	LOCAL TEMP : BYTE;
	TEMP = 7;
	ARRAY[0] = .ARRAY[2] AND .TEMP;
	END;
END ELUDOM

Not only does it make a word reference to an arry of bytes which may be 
located on an odd byte boundary, but it stomps all over an adjacent cell. 
The problem seems to occur only when the AND operator is used with 
addresses of bytes. This problem is present in both BLISS-16 V4.1 and V4.2."

I got the reply this morning:

"Thank you for reporting this problem to us. It is indeed a bug in the BLISS-16
compiler. The problem also occured with the OR operator as well as the AND. We
have fixed the problem and will include the correction in the next maintenance
release of BLISS-16. In the meantime, you can work around the problem by
introducing a temporary byte sized variable and assigning the result of the 
AND to it and then assigning the value of the temp to ARRAY[0].

Thank you for your interest in the BLISS products."

SUBJECT: MEDIUM RESOLUTION DISPLAY SPECIFICATIONS

I have a proposal regarding the display for the next medium resolution game
hardware we develop at Atari. The technical specs are somewhat unorthodox at
first glance, but there are strong economic reasons behind them. The
specification issue is particularly relevant now because I understand that
Wells-Gardner plans on phasing out the current Medium Resolution Chasis in
favor of a new design. The new design would be in production in 3/87-6/87
timeframe I believe. 

Here are the proposed specifications (Atari '86):
	1) 19-inch CRT
	2) .50 mm dot-pitch [800 dot-trios/scan (400mm/800=.50 mm dot-pitch)]
	3) 640x350 (HxV) pixel resolution non-interlaced
	4) 21.8 kHz horizontal scan frequency
	5) 60 Hz vertical scan

For reference, Paperboy had a resolution of 512x384 (HxV) and a horizontal scan
frequency of 24.5 kHz; .52mm triplet pitch.

Ideally, a display should have a 4:3 ratio of H:V pixels so the pixels are
square. Unfortunately, 640x350 yields rectangular pixels which is undesireable.
(640/350=1.83; 4/3=1.33; 512/384=1.33).

The reason for selecting 640x350 is LOWER COST derived from compatibility with
a large parallel market: the IBM PC.  IBM PC's are a commonplace tool. There
are 5 million IBM PC/XT and clones in the world. Two-thirds of them have been
sold with monochrome video cards and displays - this market has no potential
for us. In 1981, IBM introduced an improved color standard called the Enhanced
Color Graphics Adapter (EGA). Recently, it has received wide acceptance with an
estimated 140,000 units sold in 1985; there are projections of 400,000 sales in
1986, and further projections of "90% of all PC Graphics boards sold will be
EGA-compatible by 1990". 

The EGA standard calls for 640x350 pixels with a 21.8 kHz hor. scan rate. The
IBM 5174 display (EGA compatible) has a 13"  screen and .31mm Dot-pitch. Video
Drive is straight TTL RGB with a few bits of intensity control yielding 64
possible colors. I think there is 1-bit per gun plus 3 bits of intensity. Of
course we would want a product with a 19-inch screen and an analog front end. 

In summary, I propose that we solicit a display with the above "Atari '86"
specs from Wells-Gardner. Wells would then be positioned to offer a 
19-inch EGA-compatible display in the PC market with consequent cost-reduction
through volume production; we would also benefit via reduced prices; if
Wells "neglects" to pass along cost-savings, we would be well-positioned to
solicit bids from competitors already servicing the EGA-compatible market -
NEC, AMDEX, Princeton, C.Itoh, Taxan, Samsung, and Goldstar. A word of 
caution: the existing vendors make 13-inch displays only; the 19-inch version
we would require is feasible, but not currently in production.  As a general
guide, I believe we should be able to get an "Atari '86 display for under
$225...retail prices for the 13-inch 640x350 displays hover around $500 with
case and glare shield.

Subj:	System I Mid-Screen Interrupt, Revisited


The following message is of interest to System I Programmers and Engineers:

PROBLEM: Due to incomplete address decoding on the System I TTL MAIN PCB, the
	 previously documented mid-screen interrupt read address overlays the
	 Program ROM address range. There was a mod way back when to fix this,
	 but it apparently wasn't implemented.

SOLUTION:  To ameliorate this situation the address of the interrupt read
	   port is being changed from the previously advertised range of
	   200,200-3FF,FFF to the new range of 2E0,000-2FF,FFF.
	   This range is in the upper, unused area of the program rom decoder.
	   The mod was to run "G1" of the Program ROM address decoder to
	   "/A21".  This is done on the LSI MAIN PCB but not on the
	   TTL MAIN PCB.

BACKGROUND: Roadrunner was experiencing serious frame overrun problems -
	    the game would literally slow down to half speed.  The problem
	    was hardware dependent; i.e. some PCB sets ran fine, others 
	    did not.  In one situation we found an LS244 that had bent
	    pins which caused the failure.  Then the problem reared its head
	    again: this time the problem would occur on most boards when
	    Vcc was lowered to 4.8 volts; it happens with ALL boards when
	    lowered to 4.6 VDC.  After some careful sleuthing Don was able
	    to isolate the problem to a bus-contention problem between
	    an O.S. ROM on the Main PCB and an LS244 on the Cart PCB.
	    Lowering Vcc let the LS244 lose to the ROM (as I understand it)
	    which would screw up the 68010 programs ability to deal with
	    MIDSCREEN INTERRUPTS properly...frame overrun was the result.

	    A hardware mod is possible.  It involves adding a wire to run
	    "NOT A21" to a couple of places.  Since there are (5) variations
	    of MAIN PCB's in the field (between Board Revisions and ECN's)
	    this field change would be horrendous to document.  Instead,
            a software change can avoid the bus contention.  Reference
	    Don Pauuw's solution above.

Contract says that the buyer is responsible for the test vectors.



Therefore: 1K = 19,530 NRE + 4,900 = 24,430 which is $24.43 each.

	   5K = 19,530 NRE + 23,000 = 42,530 which is $8.50 each.



For oops board = $13 (approximately)

Breakeven Point:

	n * 13 = 19,530 + (n * 4.90)

	(n * 13) - (n * 4.90) = 19,530

	n * 8.10 = 19,530

	n = 2,411 pcs



Even if the oops board costs $18

Breakeven Point:

	n * 18 = 19,530 + (n * 4.90)

The breakeven point for a $13 oops board is

Subj:	Power Supplies: Opinions Solicited


13 MAY 86

In our never-ending search for a more cost-effective power supply, it
has been suggested that we look into using the same power supply found
in the IBM PC/XT. They have beefy outputs and due to volume, they
have become very cost-effective. A quick scan of PC magazines shows
XT-style 135 watt supplies selling for $88.00 quantity one ($.65/watt).
This is the retail price and includes a chrome/nickel plated enclosure,
fan, and sexy-looking on/off switch. The assumption is that we should be
able to to buy them at substanially less than $.50/watt in volume (5000)
and without enclosure/fan/switch.




QUESTION: Assuming the economics make sense, do the technical specifications
make sense?  Here is data gleaned from the label on an actual XT power supply:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CON. P8 (GOES TO MAIN LOGIC PCB): +12V @.20A

RE. XT power supplies.

The ASTEC spec that Chris published breaks down to :
 75 watts @ 5 volts, 50 watts @ 12v, 3 watts @ -12v & 1.5 watts @ -5v.

This sounds like a big brother to the ASTEC supply we used on Gauntlet when 
we were stuck for one week with no supplies for production. We had to put a 
dummy 1 amp load on the 12 Volt output to maintain regulation.

The 'Power OK' signal is probably a Power On Reset, not remote sense.

The 12 Volt output is reasonably useless to us. Future designs could make 
use of it if it came for free. We would still need a seperate power supply 
for our audio amplifiers (unless we went to use 2 ohm speakers).

My conclusion.
This particular supply has to compete in price with our 50-70 watt
supplies. 
We should see if ASTEC (or any other third party supplier in the Personal 
computer industry) is interested in working with us. 


P.S.
You can use the [MCCARTHY]PSUP distribution list to reply on this topic to 
the people addressed in Chris's original message.

I also fixed the line mode substitute command to accept delimiters other than
"/". As it stands now, any printable special character (i.e. any non-alphabetic

Subj:	SUMMARY ON PC POWER SUPPLY PROPOSAL


A few days ago I solicited comments on the technical aspects
of using an IBM PC style Power supply in our games - mainly for
cost savings.

Overall, I recommend a two-prong approach from here:
	1) Leave existing designs as-is since there are too many conversion
	   problems to change now.
	2) Seriously consider this type of supply on new designs with
	   new cabinets and new electronics which could take advantage
	   of the large 12 volt supply, the built-in fan and the built-in
	   on/off switch. There is NO REMOTE SENSE which is still a problem.

I found more technical specifications in the IBM Technical Reference:
	1) output voltage	current,min.	current max
		+5	   	2.3		   15.0
		-5	     	  0		     .3
		+12         	 .4                 4.2
		-12          	  0                  .25
	2) The "power good" signal is the logical AND of the DC output-voltage
	   sense signal and the AC input voltage fail. It is TTL compatible 
	   up-level for normal operation or down-level for fault conditions.
	3) There was no information about temperature de-rating.
	4) Provides a filtered AC output (switched by on/off), 120VAC @ 1.0 A -
	   this is a non-standard connector designed for use by the IBM 
           monochrome monitor. 

Here is a summary of the feedback received:
	1) McCarthy:...sounds like big brother to ASTEC we used in Gauntlet
                       for awhile - had to put a 1AMP load on 12 volt output
		       to maintain regulation.
		    ...12 volt output is relatively useless to us; would still
		       need separate supply for audio amp. [ I believe this 
		       is meant in the context of EXISTING system designs]
		    ...we should see if ASTEC or other 3rd party in PC industry
		       is interested in working with us.

	2)Hoff:     ... sounds like some level of investigation is warranted.
		    ...Is audio voltage/current correct?
		    ...how much would the supply save in $'s?

	3)Margolin: ...Are specs with all outputs fully loaded?
		    ...The audio could be done with a bridge amp (at extra cost)
		    ...If it does'nt have remote sense, we should'nt use it.
		    ...How do the cost figures really compare for this supply
			versus one built to our spec, assuming we buy 25000?
 
...............................................................................

For future reference, here is our current power supply cost:
	output: 5 VDC @10 Amps 0-55 degrees cent. remote sense optional;
	       12 VDC unreg @ 2amps from transformer; 12VDC reg @ .5 A added
	          to Audio Aux PCB in later revisions to support System I.

	FIXED OVRHD.:  10.52
	VAR. OVRHD.:    3.89
		------------ 
		       29.89
(I find it amazing that we DOUBLE the cost of a PCB with labor and overhead...
 probably due to the high-labor content of this hand-stuffed board and a 
 overhead rate that is 6.8 times the labor content; the overhead is 9.9 times
 the labor content on the power base!?)

These numbers are "standard costs" pulled from the ASK system on mike via
MANMAN using the LI,1215 command. 
	
Final Note: I just opened the latest issue of PC Week Magazine and found 
an advertisement from 47st. Computer (Mailorder discounter) for a 135W supply 
for...$64.95 (qty. 10+)...wow, that's $.50 a watt including a fan, a case and an
on/off switch and connectors. That compares favorably with $74.72 for the
existing 15-amp power base.

	We now have a documented case where the DATA IO programmed a 27128-2 
and verified it.  Yet the AMS will read some of the data as 00's.  Even more
amazing is that the IMI does not verify the part and also reads 00's where
there should be a valid opcode of 23.  When we ask the DATA IO to read the
failing address it reads 23 which explains why it verifies the part.

Subj:	RECAP: 68010 AMS source-level Debugger


Here is the collected opinion on the AMS/Intermetrics Source-level Debugger:

	1) The "general" Tool would be neat to have.
	2) The Intermetrics Implementation (according to those who know)
	   is'nt worth the paper its printed on (need to update that
	   old saying to: Isn't worth the ferric oxide its magnetized on)

First of all, Intermetrics does not have a good reputation here at Atari.
We have used an Intermetrics C cross-compiler here and have
adandoned it due to: 1) MANY bugs which Intermetrics refused to fix; and
2) It produces code that is 20-40% longer and slower than the Greenhill
compiler we currently use. 

Second, Jim Morris has seen and used the Intermetrics Debugger at a show and 
reports that:
	- NOT realtime
	- It patches breakpoints into the code, excutes one instruction, checks
  	  if its the breakpoint you want and so on...it will not exucute
	  code realtime which makes it just about useless in a video game.
	- Doesnt use any of the sophisticated breakpoint features of the AMS.
	- The VAX C debugger would do the same job only better.

Third, Dave Shepperd notes that a "cross-debugger" would indicate that the
software runs on the VAX and sends commands down to the AMS to debug...this
would most certainly bring KIM and CHARM to their knees.

Forth, Mike Albaugh points out that we have a large base of software that
is based on the Greenhill compiler and converting to the Intermetrics would
be painful. Morris adds that Greenhill keeps 32-bit integers while
Intermetrics keeps 16-bit integers.......

In Summary, the Validate Software is not what we need - at any price. Jim
also reports that his contacts at AMS say they are working on an internally
developed source level debugger that truly uses the AMS capabilities which
may suit our needs. Unfortunately, that software is 1-2 years away.

Iraj has been promoted and now takes care of Apple Computer.

Our new rep is John Hendricks. He is coming over tomorrow on
Friday, May 30, at 1:30 pm to bring me the data sheet on the 
TMS32010 14 MHz. part.

You are invited. RSVP.

Jon Hendricks says that the guy to talk to about the PASS system
is Dan Cox who can be reached at the general TI number (980-9000).

I think you might already know him.

I got the data sheet on the TMS32010-14. The maximum clock is actually
14.4 MHz so it can be used with a standard 14.31818 MHz crystal.

I figured out that to get the analysis to work right at the 25% higher clock
rate, the clock on the analysis board needs to be about 35% higher.  Of
course, why didn't I think of that?

	Well, I did it this weekend.  I went down to LA to pick up my
girlfriend who goes to school at CSUN, and got engaged.  Yes, she actually
said yes.  In fact she said yes so fast I didn't hear her the first time.
The wedding will be July, 1987.  I just had to tell everybody!



			Happily yours,

Subj:	Software Rots!


	To my knowledge, nobody but me ever used the non-menu
option setting routine in System 1 (the one that looks like
a set of DIP switches). So, of course, it doesn't work. I think
I broke it when I added the menu-driven one. Anyway, It's fixed
now, but that is irrelevant since there are quite a few "broken"
systems out in the field. The only effect this should have is to
force System 1 programmers to provide a game-option menu from the
start (which should not be a real hassle).
	On the bright side, I found this bug with "lint", the subject
of the next message, and would HIGHLY recomend it to all "C" programmers.

Subj:	LINT- A program checker


	I have gotten the Unix(tm) program "lint" running
on vms. For those of you unfamiliar with it, lint is a
program-checker for the "C" programming language. A short
description and instructions for use are in the file:
KIM::DOK:LINT.DOC. Slightly different but no less obscure
documentation can be found in the Unix(tm) manuals. The
actual knowledge needed to use it effectively can be
found by using it, and perhaps asking me questions while
doing so. I have a few planned improvements, but want to
do them at the same time I fix the bugs you folk are
going to discover. A word of warning: The first time you
"lint" a set of files, you are going to be overwhelmed
(the -e option helps!). Temper that with a word of
encouragement: it IS worthwhile. I found a serious bug
and much silliness in the System 1 o.s. with it, and a
couple of weeks ago I spent two days tracking down a bug
that lint would have caught (if I had had it then). If
you program in "C", please give it a try, and let me know
what's happening.

	Please notice the "to:" line of this message. The "junk" distribution
list is specifically intended for messages of general interest, but not REALLY
vital or business_related. Free kittens, restaurant referals, etc. properly go
to "junk", which is not a comment on the content of the message. This is NOT
the place to send messages like holiday schedule, parking-lot repaving, etc. 

	Conversely, "everybody" IS intended for business_related messages which
EVERYBODY (note the name) NEEDS to see. If your message fits that description,
then PLEASE DO use "everybody", so nobody misses out. 

	When we made it possible for non-systems people to use "everybody", in
response to a growing need, we asked that it not be used for casual traffic. I
am repeating that request. The only people you will miss by using "junk" are
those who have specifically requested NOT to receive general-interest stuff. I,
grouch that I am, am nonetheless on "junk". Knowing that, can you imagine the
sort of grouches that have requested removal from junk? Do you really want to
give a kitten to such a person? Do you think they buy flowers? I thought not. 

   Just as a recap: the following lists exist:

	junk		Just about everybody, except a few grouches

	What happened to the FREE tickets from Marriots Great America???
   
  These tickets were given to Atari in exchange for the use of the old
Playland roller-coaster props used in the "Grizzly" television commercial
you may have seen aired on the tube.  I understand that the $5.00 per
ticket will go to some sort of recreation fund, but free is free.
  If it weren't for Rick Moncrief's packrat tendencies and the Playland
project it self, well you know.  Credit is due where credit is due.

Subj:	OUCH! WE JUST BIT OURSELVES


On System I we are making a transition from TTL Main Boards to 
LSI main Boards. When the LSI Main board was being designed back in
Early 1985, we decided to be clever and modify a few key addresses
on the board and hence in the OS ROM to foil would-be copiers. As
is typically the case this has hurt us more than any copier. Norm
and Greg spent several hours (wee hours) last night trying to get
OS/US -114, -115 to work in their TTL Main board. Of course, -114,-115
is designed for the LSI Main and does'nt work in the TTL Main. Gotcha.
That will teach them to be so thorough. 

Here are the details on the OS/US ROMS. I will get this added to the
System I documentation on the VAX.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOARD	EPROM P/N    ROM P/N      QTY BUILT	DESCRIPTION

On 22-Apr-1986 I sent an SPR to DEC detailing the Bliss bug discovered by
Dennis. I got a reply this morning. 

"The response recieved for your Software Performance Report is as follows.
...We do not plan to publish this SPR.

Problem:

The compiler generates incorrect code for the program fragment below:

	WHILE .TEMP2 DO;	!This triggers the error
	IF .TEMP4		!Any code between it and the loop is lost
	THEN WHILE 1 DO;	!This is the infinite loop

Response:

The compiler incorrectly handled infinite loops under certain circumstances.
This problem has been fixed. The next maintenance version of the compiler will
contain the correction for this problem. In the meantime, we suggest the
work-around of compiling without optimization (using /OPT=LEVEL:0).

Thank you for your intrest in BLISS_16."

As usual, the answer is "...yep, its broke. Don't do that." Expect the the
next version (4.3) in about 4 months. In the meantime, if you need to use
infinite loops, see Dennis Harper about how he got around this problem.

PRODUCT DESIGN NOTE: SPEAKER SELECTION FOR AUDIO PCB AND AUDIO II PCB

DATE: 13 JUN 86

BACKGROUND: Recent game systems have been using the Audio PCB, A043354-01
		or Audio II PCB, A043661-01. They are the small PCB's
		about 4.5 by 5.5 inches. They use TDA 2030's delivering up to 
		10 watts to each 8-OHM speaker given the maximum input of 
		4.5-5.0 volts. See Pat McCarthy for more details. 

SPEAKER TO USE: ATARI PART NUMBER 148007-XXX WITH THESE AUDIO AMP PCB'S. 
		8-ohm, 4.5 or 5 inch round speakers, minimum of 10 watts. 
		See Erwin Arvidson for details on the specifications.
		Brad Fuller points out that while these speaker are similar, 
		they are NOT identical so they must be used in pairs:

		-001 JBL top-of-the-line in this category; best fidelity
		     and highest price, about $7.00 each. Will handle up 
		     to 40 watts; Freq response: 50-18khz; NO SHIELD.
		-002 CTS; reasonable fidelity, a notch below the JBL's.
		     Cost unknown.
		-003 Pioneer; reasonable fidelity, a notch below the JBL's.
		     Cost about $4.00. NO SHIELD.
		-004 Ultimate Sound; reasonable fidelity, a notch below
		     the JBL's; Freq. response: ??-12khz; Cost about $3.25 (?).
		     NO SHIELD. If you specify this, then show -104 as an
		     acceptable substitute since Materials spec buys the
		     shielded version and we may have inventory.
		-104 Ultimate Sound; same as -004 but WITH SHIELD. Cost
		     $3.81 (Wallin 6/86 qty. 2000) since shield adds about $.50.

Subj:	Good, Reliable Housecleaners


      If you need housecleaning done (one-time deal, occasionally, or on a
 regular basis), I can highly recommend a couple.  They have done house-
 cleaning for me for over four years, and Dave Shepperd recently started
 using them regularly.  They clean everything from small apartments to large
 houses, and do unusual projects, such as lining shelves and drawers with
 paper.

      They are professionals, meaning you DON'T have to tell them what to
 clean, and they are completely reliable, thorough, and honest.  I have given
 them my house key and burglar-alarm combination, and they simply come in
 about once a month, clean everything, and leave an invoice on the counter.
 Theft isn't even a consideration.  They're not the cheapest housecleaners,
 but you get what you pay for.

      I don't get a commission for selling their services -- I'm just provid-
 ing useful information for anyone who's interested.  Mention my name if you
 call them.

voluntary standard (for which SOME details were published), centering on
whether it had been designed to allow them to easily read "private"
communications. If this doesn't bother you, consider what your reaction would be
to the U.S. Postal service ( which already  has a legal monopoly on carrying
mail) proposing that, for effiency, only it could provide envelopes and these
envelopes could only be sealed and opened by postal service employees.

	In an unrelated (?) item, the Supreme Court has upheld a Georgia
anti-sodomy law with (apparently, I just heard it on the radio) wording that
suggests a repudiation of the "consenting adults" standard for sexual behavior.
This may signal a return to the days of an F.B.I. man under every bed, or it
may just mean they want a few more possible charges to nail dissenters with.

	As an upbeat ending, maybe we should look at all this as a business
opportunity. In preparation for the next video-game downturn, we should start
our design for a telescreen, so we'll be ready when they ask for bids. Remember,
1984 isn't in the past, it's just a few years late.

Our right to privacy in this country is a great thing and should be
protected by our courts.  The police squads that violate our privacy
by busting down doors have no place in America, and I wish we could
jail those (you've read about them in the papers) instead of just
slapping their hands and letting them do it again.  It seems some
police just can't handle victim-less crimes.

There is a place for door-busting in the case of some violent crimes,
and I hope for our sakes that the police can use whatever force is
appropriate in those cases, and be commended for their courage instead
of harrassed by those with 20/20 hindsight.  It seems to me that our
society is giving more support and consideration to those among us
who directly or indirectly are serving to thin out our population.
What with our fears of over-population and opposing socio-economic
groups, maybe we subconciously desire to wipe out each other.  It
doesn't seem too healthy to me especially in a country that has the
power to exterminate the world, so I hope I'm way off base.

By the way, about a month ago there was an article in the Mercury that
related some findings in a major medical establishment researching
AIDS.  One of the researchers did contract AIDS through careless
handling, and it was found that the AIDS virus could survive five DAYS
on a countertop outside of a "bodily fliud" and could survive over
three hours in hot water (but of course everyone knows you can't get
AIDS in a hot tub).

I am concerned that AIDS may become a very big problem, and while it's
very sad for those affected by it, I think it would be sadder still
not to protect the right to life of our next generation.

...no, I did not vote for Reagan...

	While I also ate at the sandwich express and agree they are a good
place, I must take exception to the statment that there's nothing good in
Milpitas. La Milpa has excellent Mexican food, Mandarin House is a good
Chinese restaurant, Bay Palace and Buckley are "not bad" Chinese (with good
value). Casa Azteca is "not bad" Mexican with margaritas. Gasthaus zum
Goldenem Adler has good (but expensive) German food. Bakers Square is a
better than average "American" restaurant. Round Table and No Name have
good Pizza, and there's a "not bad" Japanese restaurant next to the Round Table
(The one on Abbot, Which I prefer to the one on Calveras). For fast-food there
is one of about every chain of burger places. And I almost forgot, If you
haven't been to the Sizzler lately you should check it out.
	While only La Milpa or the Gasthaus are, in my opinion, "worth a
side trip", all of the above will keep body and soul together and those are
just the ones I've tried and found "ok" or better. Try exploring!

Subj:	Put Another Law on the Fire...


	I'm ALMOST sorry I said anything. I'm also amused (and a bit
disapointed) that all the debate centers on only ONE of the two items I
mentioned. While I certainly don't want the FBI under my bed, I am equally
opposed to them reading my mail. A case could be made that the sex laws are
more odious because while there is SOME probability of anarchist bombers being
caught by reading all mail (before they blow up the bus full of handicapped
kids), there is virtually ZERO probability that a morals bust will have any
positive effect on the population (or any effect whatever, other than on the
principals and the already clogged courts). These comparisons of relative danger
should not obscure the basic idea that ALL strengthening of government "right to
know" versus personal "right to privacy" is very dangerous and should be very
carefully watched. There are also those who maintain that child molesters have
a right to privacy from intervention, so it IS possible to go too far. A clear
sense of when "the people" means US (common public), or THEM (institutionalized
government), or nothing but a campaign slogan, is needed. In short, it depends
whose ox is gored. Anyway, my real reason for this second note is to object to
Lew Harp's "only in America...". You must be kidding, Lew. The ruler's "right"
to dictate and inspect the commoner's life is older than history, and the debate
about when and how it is REALLY needed is very little younger. The whole idea
that we, as the governed, have anything at all to say about our privacy is
only about as old as the Magna Carta, which nonetheless pre-dates America by
a few hundred years.
	One last soapbox stand: "Qui Tacit, Consentit" (Who remains silent,
consents). I know there aren't often that many desireable candidates, but there
are PLENTY of undesireable ones. Vote early and often!

Subj:	THE NSA RULES


It is curious that the NSA wants all encryption be done with their
devices since their charter(?) only allows them to monitor communications
that are not internal to the United States.  They are trying to pull a
fast one just like the Supreme Court. Speaking of which, their anti-
sodomy, anti-fornication, anti-adultery ruling could clearly set the
ground work to hassle just about anybody.  Only married couples engaging
in non-sodomic relations have a fundamental right to such behavior
(according to the court) which implies that marriage creates the 
fundamental right of non-sodomic behavior and that divorce destroys it.
But since at least some of these laws have not been enforced for
hundreds of years the ruler's right to enforce these laws has been waived.
So the debate is ended and I'm sure the Supreme Court will change their
ways soon.

frankly (between you and me), were not that impressive. A few people spending
a little time on such matters could possibly lead to a whole new government
agency with its own UNLIMITED BUDGET! In other unrelated matters, I'm sure
there must be somewhere else where certain judges have outlawed certain 
private acts that certain state officials have claimed spread certain health
hazards that certain studies have shown not to be related to those certain
private acts and where all of this does bear some resemblence to reality but
then again maybe I'm not sure.

Attention TPU users...

You may want to put the following procedure into your TPU init file...
This procedure activates the GOLD O key to toggle on and off the

useful when modifying tables which already have some data you want
to re-use, and where all the columns are set up already.  When in this
mode, everything you type is placed directly over what is already there
(as opposed to insert mode, which is the normal state).

	Good Luck,

Subj:	Cryptic Answers

	So far We have only 4 interested parties, so the "distribution list"
will be kim::sys$userdisk:[albaugh]crypto.dis, rather than bugging Steph to
add yet another list. Anyway, Steve asked what, other than hurt feelings,
would motivate NSA to hide details of the new system and felt that they were
being reasonable, if not totally selfless. He also felt that anything short of
a legal monopoly would be relatively harmless and that said legal monopoly
would be not bloody likely. Please correct me, Steve, if I have distorted your
position. My reply to those points follows:
	The crux of the heat they got on DES (the last one) was that by
witholding certain design details (namely the rationale for the choice of
"s-boxes"), they made it impossible for independent researchers to verify the
security of the system. There was also some question as to why the original IBM
proposal for a 64 bit key was weakened to a 56 bit key at NSA's demand. The
(perhaps paranoid) contention of some top cryptographers was that the DES was
actually designed to be broken by the NSA, to provide them access to private
communications. Even those who trusted the NSA not to read their mail were not
to keen on having "trapdoors" in the system which might be fortuitously
discovered by the Russians (or worse, their business rivals). It is axiomatic
in cryptography that any system that depends for its security on concealment of
the ALGORITHM, rather than the KEY is fatally flawed (Check out any of the
several books on the German Enigma). In this case the NSA, to its credit, did
"publish" the algorithm, but only to American Citizens (I have a copy,
somewhere in my files). Anybody who thinks that the laws against its
disemination to foreign nationals slowed the Russians down by more than 5
minutes may now leave the discussion. The Brouhaha came about when several
independent cryptographers questioned the above mentioned weaknesses and were
quite harshly shut up. No rubber hoses or black Mercedes, just Visa revocations
and threats of prosecution under the official secrets act. (please no questions
about Master-Card). In any case it was the REACTION to reasonable questioning
that provoked the paranoia. Something along the lines of "If they have nothing
to hide, how come they're so jumpy?" The problem with the new proposal is
similar. If they are unwilling to discuss even the algorithm, then the study
needed to assure its security CANNOT be made. This is a similar problem to the
one MIS managers have with having to trust programs without access to the
sources. We live with it, for the most part, but I don't think anybody likes
it. And I bet NO bank has such a setup for running its instant tellers. There
is also the point that the Russians, should they desire, could again almost
certainly "peel" one of the chips and be in a better position than a loyal
American to read your mail. Well, that was a long one... Next point:
	Without quibbling about the current courtroom climate, I submit that
no legal monoploy is required to force acceptance of the new standard. If the
NSA can get the Federal Reserve to use its new scheme, then member banks will
have to support it. Having already "bought" the NSA scheme, they are not likely
to want to pay extra for another, especially when a) their competitors aren't
spending that money, b)such action would be dimly viewed by Washington, as
obstructionism, and c)their competitors aren't being obstructionists. The
world of business/government runs on favors and "not rocking the boat". I
do want to quibble a little with the "likelihood" argument by pointing out
that the IRS gets most Americans to spend several hours and/or hundreds of
dollars on filling out a self-incriminating (see 5th amendment) document
every year. They do this primarily by threats, rather than actually dragging
very many people out of their houses and into court (where the IRS often loses).

	I do expect some lively comment on the above, but Chris Downend had
a more technical (rather than political) question, to wit:

	What ever happened to the Public-key system? Did it go away cause
	Uncle Sam didn't like it? or did it go away cause the inventors
	tried to make a buck on it rather than put it in the public domain?

	The answer is that it didn't go away. It SEEMS to be more secure
than private key systems, or rather just as secure and less prone to key-
distribution problems. Unfortunately, it is inherently computation intensive
and therefore more expensive. While there are DES chips on the market (in about
the $20 range, I think) the only public-key chip was still in development last
I heard. Some DES hardware is fast enough to place in a disk channel, whereas
the RSA (public key) chip is HOPING for 9600 bits per second. RSA, by the way
stands for Rivest, Shamir, Adelman (not sure of spellings). These three proposed
and patented the most widely known public key system, although the IDEA of
public key systems has (I think) first proposed by Diffie and Hellman. I know
of at least two other schemes, although one has been compromised (Merkle's
Trap-door knapsack), and the other is a minor variation on RSA (used by GCC
in the Atari 7800) whose major merit is it sneaks by an oversight in the RSA
patent and avoids royalty payments. Anyway, Uncle Sam's dislike for public
key systems has less to do with their success/failure than pure economics does.
The reason you don't hear much about them is partly because after the NSA
got Hellman et al to shut up, cryptography in general ceased to be very
newsworthy. In technical circles, the hot setup nowadays is to use some private
key system (often a variant of DES) for the bulk transfers and a public-key
system for distributing the private keys. It is interesting to note that at
least one system, UNIX(tm) uses a DES-like scheme, but deliberately avoids
using DES verbatim, precisely because the wide availability of DES chips makes
it easier to construct a "brute force" code-cracker, provided the cyphertext is
known to have created by DES.

	I realize that was quite a bit to read through, so now I'll shut up for
at least a day and collect some of YOUR thoughts.

	I just read that the NSA is planning to "de-certify" DES as of the
end of next year. This presumably means that they will no longer state
that "it has adequate security for non-military communications for the
forseeable future". They have not set a time for when the new proposed
standard will be available. Incidentally, one of the reasons they gave
for abandoning DES is that it has become so widespread that an attack
on it would be VERY fruitful, therefore such an attack is more likely
than one on a less often used system. In other words, DES is no good
because too many of you used it because it was so good. Not so incidentally,
this was also one of the arguments put forth by the opponents of DES
when it was under consideration, namely, that any system proposed for
widespread use MUST be more secure than normal, simply because there
is a correspondingly greater incentive to break it. At the time the NSA
said this was nonsense.

	We have a hard enough time upgrading versions of VMS which are
supposed to be "upwardly compatible"-- that is, using the new version
isn't supposed to hurt.  If they change the standard every couple of years,
and the new standard (and new equipment/algorithm) doesn't support old
data, or "other" offices with old equipment/algorithms, there will exist
a cryptographic tower of Babel--even if bothe ends use the same language.

	Why not have a system where an arbitrarily long key means to
invoke the system recursively for each unit of length (such as once
for each character of the password).

	Or we could adopt the mechanism VMS uses--a one-way algorithm
that means  you have to know the answer to find out what it is (re-encrypt
the same data to see if it matches).

	The real problem is that it is desired to send a minimum quantity
of data, representing a maximum quantity of information.  The less data
transmitted, the higher the information content has to be, and the more
likely possibility that the information from the cleartext can be extracted.
If you could send the Websters unabridged, you could just omit letters
that make up your message.  Unless someone knew to compare for missing letters,
and how they related to the cleartext, the amount of information to weed
through would be staggering.  Unfortunately, so would transmission time.
And there is no question about recording a disk in the encrypted format.

Subj:	Jed's idea


	I like it a lot--I think that HBO and others like them have no right
whatsoever to charge a fee for something they broadcast.  The key word is
broadcast.  It is entirely reasonable for cable companies to go after
pirate viewers, because they are taking pains to service those with whom
they have a contract.  I don't own a sattelite, and probably never will,
so that is not the reason for my point of view.  I do not currently
subscribe to HBO because of the price.  I might one day, but by cable,
and legitimately (for money).  But if you can decode the signal, you
are entitled to do so.  Regardless of what HBO says.

	If someone were to have a fistfight in the middle of the street,
and have the cops come and break it up, most people would look out their
windows to see what was going on.  Would you then accede to a request to
pay admission, and that retroactively?  The idea is ludicrous.

	If you were to stand in a crowd and hear someone yell about where
to find some great treasure, would you not be entitled to act on the inform-
ation?  As well as everyone else?

	If I was to discover a circuit diagram or listing under the glass of
a copying machine in a post office, I would feel it was public information.
And the company or employee would have one hell of a time demonstrating that
I did anything wrong by using a public copier.  It is the responsibility of
companies such as Atari and HBO to keep their trade secrets uncompromised.
It is one of the reasons for having the two entites "trade secret" and "
"copyright" -- which are very different.

	A radio, or, yes, Virginia, even a television set, is an electro-
magnetic signal decoder.  Potentially more, or less, complicated than
HBO's (or anyone else's) scrambler.

	We all decode broadcast information.  Several newspapers on the
driveway of our neighbors "announces" that they are away.  Are you vio-
lating the law by knowing this?  If there is smoke coming out of their
chimney in winter, are you violating their rights be noticing?

	If the "violators" tried to sell subscriptions of their own, that
would be a different story.  But the people HBO is after have done nothing
wrong!  And do you know how they are found?  Their "pirate" decoding equipment
BROADCASTS a signal that can be detected.  This same signal might be generated
by any number of means, but IF their van detects the carrier frequency coming
from your house, you get a retoactive bill.  They are doing to you what you
have "perpetrated" on them.

	Yes, Jed's idea has merit.  But HBO has a lot of pull, and has
cause to invest a VERY large fortune in the most cost-effective manner
(notice I didn't say anything about laws or ethics) to have things seen
their way.  I don't think there exists an electronics-manufacturing company
other than IBM who has the power to survive the inevitable war.  And,
unfortunately, I am certain that company management will see things the same
way.  After all, that's their job.   So, as always, the monopolists will
continue the monopoly, the elite will continue to be the elite, the
rich get richer and the poor get poorer, because that's the way it is.

	If my soapbox seems a little slanted, that's because it is.

This DES thing might have some possibilities.

Part A of this message is background and may be skipped if desired.
[If you start to read Part A and think I am proposing something illegal
go directly to Part B.-- the author.]

Part A
------
HBO and many of the other satellite networks that scramble their signal use
the M/A COM VideoCipher II system which they claim uses the DES
algorithm. [I should, however, point out that both M/A COM and HBO
are masters of disinformation and they may simply want to put everyone
on the wrong track.]

In the Videocipher II system each unit has its own ID number and is
addressed by a signal in the transmitted program that tells it to decode
the signal. [The video is either inverted or not and is changed at periodic
random intervals but the audio is digitally encrypted.] Presumably the signal 
that tells it you have paid your monthly subscription gives it the key.

The way that HBO and the other services are currently handling subscriptions
is really bogus. If you live within the service area of a cable company
you pay the CABLE COMPANY which keeps part of the money and sends the rest
to HBO. In many cases satellite subscribers are charged MORE than cable
subscribers. In this case the real pirates are the cable companies (who seem 
to be behind the move to scramble all the signals including the 'Superstations'
like WTBS, WOR, and WGN which are COMMERCIAL TV stations. 

There is already evidence that this rip-off will fail as Congress has started 
looking into the situation. [Lots of Congressman have constituants in rural 
areas and have no access to television other than  by satellite.]

As a satellite dish owner I do not mind paying a reasonable fee for being able 
to watch quality programming. If the programmers are not fairly compensated
for their work they will cease producing quality programs. (By the way there
are satellite networks supported entirely by advertising and they are as
bad as any regular commercial broadcast station.)

Like I said, I think the subscriber fee issue will sort itself out unless
the cable industry succeeds in killing off the home satellite market. There
are already two million of us and we will not give up without a fight.

Part B
-------
It is illegal to sell a box that descrambles the signal without requiring
the subscriber to pay for the service. Anyone producing such a box faces
heavy fines and jail time. Therefore anyone producing such a box could never
sell very many because of the visibility required to sell a lot of anything.
So let's not do that.

BUT.

There is nothing illegal about producing a unit that DOES require 
addressibility. It's just that no one does.

Currently, the only way to get one is to buy it from M/A COM. For $400.
Satellite receiver manufactors are pissed because M/A COM will not sell them
the chip set. M/A COM WILL sell them a complete board for $168 which will
not fit inside most satellite receivers because M/A COM deliberately made
the board large (with lots of empty board space) so customers would be fooled
into thinking they were getting their money's worth.

If someone could do it with a $50 chip set they could either make and sell 
their own unit or could sell the chip sets to satellite receiver manufactureres.

It would require a modest investment by a company with the facilities of a 
company like ATARI.

I have other thoughts on the matter if people are interested.

	Jed

	Some thoughts in reply to Steve.

	Arbitrarily long keys tend to be generated by some algorithm operating
on a shorter seed. This is the case, for instance, in "random" numbers picked
by humans, where digits past the third (or so) tend to be negatively
correlated with preceding digits (most humans feel 5555 is NOT an random
number, and 666 even less so).

	Repeated encryptions are not neccessarily any more difficult to
decrypt than single ones. Consider the simple substitution cipher that adds,
modulo 26, a key to each letter. Encryption in the key of 3, then 4 is
indistinguishable from a single encrytion with 7. The cryptanalyst need not
discover the actual keys used in encryption, just one of the many that work.
If you think my example is trivial you're right. If you think it's irrelevant,
you're wrong. Much of the work in designing encryption algorithms goes into
finding and negating fortuitous isomorphism (love that phrase). Even schemes
that have "circulating" keys with different periods need to be careful that
the total period is long, relative to the amount of traffic. Because of this,
the keys themselves are not truly random (you need to avoid certain pairs
of keys) and this lack of randomness helps your opponent.

	In general one "long enough" key is theoretically better than two short
ones, but the considerations in the first paragraph mean that your one long key
is (perhaps unconsciously) derived from a short one. Keep in mind that "long
enough" is "at least as long as the total of all messages to be sent with this
key". This is the classic one-time-pad, which is literally impossible to
decrypt, but also thoroughly impractical for any volume of traffic. The key
distribution is equal in volume to the message traffic, so if the key channel is
secure, you just use it for the message traffic. This ignores the usual use of
the one-time-pad, which is where you have a lot of time before a specific event
in which to hand-deliver the key (the pad) but must use a fast, nonsecure
channel as soon after the event as possible (the launch codes for nuclear
missiles are one such case). In practice, just about all systems use a
relatively short key (32-256 bits) as a seed and permute it in some way as they
work to generate the effect of a long key.

	One-way algorithms are at the heart of most "public key" systems, but
there are two problems. A truly "one-way" scheme would be useless except for
authentication (which is what VMS uses it for). If you have to have the
cleartext to read the message, where did you get it. The public key systems
use pairs of "one way" functions which together form a two-way function.
As I said in a previous note, these tend to be pretty computation intense, and
the more esoteric (and faster) of them have not yet been PROVEN to be one-way.
(in fact one has recently been proven NOT to be).

	The problem of information quantity is not quite so straightforward.
Most modern encryption schemes are pretty sensitive to noise. That is, if one
bit of the cyphertext gets flipped, LOTS of the cleartext gets clobbered. For
this reason, some sort of error correction is applied as an "envelope", after
encryption. If it were applied before it would be harder for the legitimate
reader to recover from errors and easier for the interceptor to decrypt (because
of the redundancy in the "cleartext" added by check bits). Anyway, a one-time
pad with no error corection at all would suffice for most traffic that could
stand a typo here or there. The quantity of traffic (not information in Messr
Shannon's sense) would simply be twice the length of the cleartext (once for the
message and once for the key, but through two distinct channels). A real
consideration is the information density. Ideally the enemy does not even know
that a message was sent. In both World Wars, "traffic analysis" was used to
derive information about troop movements. Skilled listeners identified the
radio operators by their "fists" (characteristic rhythms of Morse-code sending)
and triangulated to find their locations. If "Fritz" has been sending from
a location where the 25th PanzerGruppe has been seen and now he seems to
be sending from 50 miles north of there then there is a good chance that the
25th has moved (or Fritz has been re-assigned, but nothing is for certain).
Since we can't be silent all the time and still send messages, the next best
thing is to send all the time and just switch between sending random trash
and real messages as the need arises. Two problems. Sending all the time
makes it real easy for the enemy to send a radio-guided rocket down your
throat. "Random trash" is not so easy to come by (see above). The German
radio operators had a foolish habit of using Bible readings for their filler,
and encrypting them with the current key. Gave the British some lovely
samples of "known cleartext" to work with. With regard to Websters Unabridged,
"book codes" are moderately popular, but such a common book as a well known
dictionary would be a poor choice. Steve's suggestion is also remeniscent of
a "Baconian cipher", but I've already prattled too long so I'd like to hang
up the tech-talk for now.

	My comment on the other message should probably start "Now, I'm not
a lawyer but...". The first ammendment protects only your right to speak, not
my right to hear, and even so exceptions have been made. I know Oliver Wendell
Holmes was in many ways a jerk, but he was also in a position to effectively
re-write the constitution and his "... fire in a crowded theatre..." remark
is valid. The "right" to listen to anything (but not to re-broadcast) is MUCH
newer (1934, Jed?) and much less sacred or widespread (Not all western nations
have it). I would also caution restraint. Carrying your argument to its logical
conclusion would make it perfectly ok for the FBI to use an inductive tap on
your phone with no court order or even probable cause. I happen to agree that
HBO is out of line IF they refuse to sell their services to individuals, but
that issue should be directly addressed, not skated around. I do feel that any
"narrowcaster" who relies on laws rather than technology to protect his data
is somewhat like a person who refuses to lock his door and lobbies for the
death penalty for trespassing. Conversely, I think I should have a right to
privacy from someone who sets up a cherry-picker outside my bedroom window
and bounces a laser off the glass to hear what I whisper.

	I had in mind when I wrote my epistle to mention the laser-off-the-
window mechanism of descrambling audio signals.  And to point out that the
government does not rely on the court system to prevent people from doing it.
Those who care about the secrecy of their information should not broadcast it.
Because the likelihood of someone picking it up (and decoding it if necessary)
is inversely proportional to the desirability.  And, like it or not, a broad-
cast is a broadcast.

	Regarding phone taps (inductive or otherwise):  The law doesn't say
they can't tap your phone; the law says they can't use that as evidence in
court.  Fortunately, this is almost always the reason they want to tap your
phone; but (as in the case of industrial spying, or the spying industry, even)
it still can be (and is) done, and not always by the government.  Those who
care, TAKE care to prevent the occurrance.  Voice scramblers have been around
for quite a while, just for people like this.

	I maintain, a broadcast is a broadcast.

Subj:	"last" HBO message?


	I want to rebut some of Steve's last message, and will below, but
I also want to point out that I originally asked for those interested in the
TECHNICAL, rather than LEGAL aspects of cryptography. I have nothing against
the discussion of HBO's latest outrage or mating habits of the lesser Bullfinch,
I just don't happen to be interested in them.
	Point one, I hope that nobody RELIES on legal mechanisms to protect
their privacy or property. That is, I hope you lock your door rather than
saying "Oh well, burglary is illegal so nobody will enter my house." Just the
same, the threat of prosecution is PART of your defense. If there was no
sanction against entering your property without your permission, you would
not only have to lock your door, you would have to armor all your walls.
At present, few thieves would bash your door in with a sledge hammer, because
it is a fairly obvious and noisy job, and they wish to avoid detection and
subsequent arrest. Not all neighborhoods recognize the sanctions mentioned,
and in these you do have to armor your house, or take the other approach
which is to CLEARLY have nothing of value in your house. This second tactic
is the basis for the inadmissability of ILLEGALY OBTAINED wiretap info as
evidence.
	Contrary to your statements, wiretaps ARE illegal, both for the
government and private individuals (or industry). There are certain
exceptions made specifically for the purpose of law enforcement, but
these exceptions are only made under circumstances equivalent to those
in which a search warrant would be issued. Your statement that it can
be, and is, done, therefore it must be legal is naive at best. Do you
seriously believe that NOBODY anywhere breaks the law. On the other hand, do
you depend SOLELY on your locks to prevent burglary, and assume that sheer
laziness, rather than some caution regarding arrest, deters thieves from
bashing the door in?
	Laws are passed to codify what behavior is sanctioned by society. The
sanctions serve to curb blatant and repeated offenses. Prudence dictates that
each individual make his own defense against the remaining sporadic attacks.
I agree that HBO should scramble a signal they don't want anyone to receive,
and they do. I also feel that the law regarding sale of decoders is subject to
debate, but point out that sale of handguns and burglar tools is regulated in
many locales. Lastly, you are free to maintain that "a broadcast is a broadcast.
(is a broadcast...?)", but the LAW is based on more than your opinion. My
feeling is that those who oppose a law should lobby to change it, not just
decide not to obey it. The subject of what SHOULD be law is not one I wish to
debate here.

VMS 4.4 has been installed on Kim. With it came new run-time libraries.
If you have programs linked to any of the shareable libraries, you'll
need to re-link them.

DEC also changed the default file type for TPU section files from .GBL
to .TPU$SECTION and you'll have to re-compile any section files that
you are currently using. You will be rudely notified of same if you
forget.

99% of the other changes are user transparent (so they say), so you
don't need to worry about them.

Subj:	DRA2:


The jig is up. The primary reason for updating VMS to 4.4 on Kim was to
see if the multi-disk volume set bug was fixed. It was, so DRA2 is going
to be combined with DRA1 into a single logical volume. The procedure for
doing this is to empty DRA2, re-initialise it, mount it /BIND'ed to DRA1
and restore the files. You will then see the directory trees that you
had on DRA1 and DRA2 merged into one tree. If there are duplicate files
on the two volumes or files with the same names (but different contents)
in the same place in duplicate directory trees, they'll probably get
screwed up. I suggest you rename the directories you have on DRA2 so they
don't match directories you have on DRA1 IF you don't want them merged.

When VMS adds a file to a multi-disk volume set, it puts the file on the
disk that has the most room. This allows us to combine the free space of
both drive 1 and 2 into one big pool, but also means we can't go back to
a single drive system. Files are allowed to overflow from one volume to
another should the free space on one disk get used up. Additional volumes
can be added at any time, so we could stick on another disk with no
difficulty later. In case you're worried about all your command files
breaking because they specifically point to files on drive 1 or 2, you
needn't worry. In a multi-disk volume set one may use the device name
of any of the disks in the set to reference the whole set. I.e. DRA1:
(or SYS$USERDISK:) and DRA2: may be used equally so no command files
should break.

I'll do the restore after you have notified me that you are done "fixing"
anything on DRA2.

Subj:	NSA and DES


This serves to add more insight to Mike's earlier comments about the
NSA's current stance on DES:

from Mini-micro Systems July 1986
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier this year, NSA began to send quiet signals at industry conferences
and meetings that DES was no longer good enough to protect U.S. data
communications. NSA's feelings surfaced publicly in March when Harold
Daniels, the agency's deputy director of information security, responded
to questions raised by analysts at Datapro Research Corp of Delran, N.J.,
about NSA's current view of DES.

In a letter to Datapro, Daniels said: "The National Security Agency has
supported, based on efforts that were initiated in the mid-1970's, the
use of DES-based encryption equipment for unclassified U.S. application
through a formal equipment endorsement program and direct government user
support. This unique initiative to engage U.S. Industry in the business
of crytographic equipment has been very successful...The use of the DES
algorithm, however, has made it an increasingly attractive target for our
adversaries."
"We will continue to endorse DES products under the existing program until
January 1,1988,"he continued, "but do not intend to certify the DES algorithm
when it is reviewed in 1988."

The article goes on to say:

There's evidence that the flap over Daniel's letter is having some effect on
the NSA itself. Telephone calls to Daniels were referred to NSA Public Relations
officials. There, an NSA official said that Daniel's letter contained some
"inaccuracies" and that an official statement explaining NSA's "real" position
on DES would be forthcoming.

---------------------end of article excerpt-----------------------------------

....It sounds like the NSA bit itself in the ass since as I recall, when
DES was being formulated, a 64-bit key (more secure) was proposed, but the
NSA pushed for the current 56-bit key. If they had used the longer key,
they probably would'nt be in their current predicament - not as soon anyway.
Or maybe there is a trapdoor in it afterall - why else would the NSA be so
paranoid? I know, that's a silly question.

Subj:	New version of Green Hills C compiler


There is a new release of the Green Hills C compiler V1.8.0

$ cc:== $sys$sysdevice:[green.1v8v0]ccom.exe

This version seems to work, the code is slightly smaller if you don't use
the -o switch, and slightly larger if you do. (Your experience may differ).
The -r switch now works, plus you can put the segments into your own sections:

$ cc -dcodeseg=xx  ! this will put the code segment into section xx (default 9)
$ cc -ddataseg=xx  ! this will put the data segment into section xx (default 14)
$ cc -r -dinitseg=xx  ! this will put the initialised data into section xx
		      ! if the -r option is used as well (default 13)

The following flag must be used -X35 - this produces motorola output source.

The output now defaults to a .s file - use -X29 to output a .asm if you want.
-X12 should be used if the target is a 68010 (the case for most people here)

so:-

$ cc -x35 -x12 -r file.c

Will compile file.c and produce file.s (which you then assemble)
Initialised data is in section 13, uninitialised data is in section 14 and
code is in section 9.

Full documentation on option flags, optimising procedures that the compiler
uses, side effects of optimisation and portability problems are discussed in
the file sys$userdisk:[green.1v8v0.doc]ccom68.doc.

****************************************************************************
********************* PLEASE TRY THIS NEW VERSION NOW **********************
*********************  and  REPORT BUGS TO ME	      **********************
****************************************************************************

I strongly advise you to try this out, because if it works ok (ie I don't 
get any complaints). We shall try to make everyone use the same version of the
compiler, so I don't have to support 5 different ones.
The only way I can know if it works for you is if you try it!!!!!


We shall archive the older versions so old projects can still be compiled,
but if you are in a position to use the new version, please do it.
(games going to field test or release in the next month are excepted, for NOW)

PS. (For some of the die hards, & "I don't get told things", people)
If you are not doing something like the following, then you are doing it 
the hard way:-

$ cc file.c		! Green Hills compiler (V1.8.0!!!)
$ as68k file.s		! Mahar's fast assembler
$ LLF filea,fileb,locfile/OPT/OUT=file.hex/SYM/MAP 
! Dave's very fast linker/locator/formatter

You should not be using asm68 to assemble the compilers output.
You should not be using CLNK, CLOC & CFOR. (These are old lo tech.)

Using the MAKE facility makes it easier to develop your games, and
easier for someone else to recompile them a few years later!!

Subj:	SET HOST command


	Some of you have complained that SET HOST doesn't work properly
from KIM, giving CLI errors about "can't parse REST" and so on.  Some of
you haven't.  Some of you just haven't found out about it yet.

	The culprit is that they apparently changed the command tables
and did away with the entity REST, and implemented the SET HOST command
differently.  Unfortunately, we don't all use the command tables that
come with the operating system.  Specifically, if you use C for the 68000,
you execute a command file which loads a different set of command tables,
which were built on a different base of DEC's command tables.  This has been
fixed--I rebuilt the tables to use the V4.4 command tables.

	So, the next time (after now) that you log in, executing the
CDEFS command file won't blow away your SET HOST command.  Also, you'll
be able to use the new commands available with V4.4;  They are:

CALL, SUBROUTINE, ENDSUBROUTINE:  CALL is like an @samefilename, and
requires a label (like a goto).  That label must be followed by a
SUBROUTINE statement (command) which turns the rest of the line after the
call into parameters (starting with P1).  Subroutines are terminated
by an EXIT or ENDSUBROUTINE command.  If a SUBROUTINE command is
encountered through a GOTO or falling into it, everything between the
SUBROUTINE and the matching ENDSUBROUTINE is ignored.

GOSUB and RETURN: GOSUB works like it does in Basic:  It does a GOTO and
remembers where to come back when a RETURN is encountered.  A CALL defines
a new procedural level.

There is also a new command SET SYMBOL/SCOPE=([NO]LOCAL,[NO]GLOBAL) which
makes (higher-level-local, global) symbols [in]accessible to this procedural
level (and all levels invoked from within this level).  As a procedural
level is exited, the global level is restored to what it was at the time
that level was entered, so that deeper-nested po
procedures can't modify the global accesibility on their callers.
Setting symbol scope off makes the symbols undefined for that procedural
level, without trashing them for lesser-nested levels.

	If this message sounds as jumpy as I expect it to, I apologize; I
was interrupted while I sent it.  Ask me (by mail) if you want it clarified.

Subj:	Version 1.8.0 of the Green Hills C compiler, again


There are a number of interesting new options in the new compiler (1v8v0).

One of which is -X133 which will use DS.B instead of DCB.B.
This means that the hex files will be much smaller, although your global
or static variables won't be set to zero (which shouldn't be relied on anyway!!)

Also the default now is to give an eror if a #define redefines something, the
option -X105 will suppress the warnings, ( the default on the old version ).

Another difference is that the old version converted any name starting with
_ (ie _fred) to start with . (.fred). The new version leaves the _ alone,
unless you use the -X20 which will do what the old one did (why???).

Thats all for now, I will mail any other important discoveries as they occur.

add-a-coin, buy-in game called RAMPAGE.  Developed in-house and scheduled for

are high, in the range of Super Sprint initial $.  

3.  Sega is shipping the ride-on Enduro Racers.  Only one locally so far seems
to be in the San Mateo Gold Mine where it earned $830 in its first week.  By
next week it should be in some of the local Golflands.  (Price for SD $4395
UR $2795).  

4.  Sente is supposedly trying to get a gun-type game out on test in Sunny-
vale Golfland (for their system), but it hasn't worked the last few attempts.

5.  Konami is shipping a 2-player simul, add-a-coin, buy-in piece called
Salamander in Europe and Japan.  (Coin Slot reports they sold 400 already
in Europe, and Namco earnings reports show it making top yen in some of their
locations).  From photos, it looks like an outdated Galaga-style game.  No
known price, delivery yet for U.S.  

That's about it for now, Mary

	Good news, Bad news, Garage Sale, and Adieu's

1) Garage Sale: Finally, here is the garage sale you all have been waiting
for!  How many times have you seen the sign 'garage sale' and complained
about the false advertising -- the garage itself was not really for sale.
Well, finally, the True Sale comes forth -- a real garage sale! And for 
just a limited time, if you are among the first customer, you will get,
free of extra charge, an attached house!  This deal is not to be beat, just
bought!

2) Good News: Because of the expected result of the previous advertisement,
my wife has finally found a house she likes in a neighborhood she loves. So,
we are currently in the process of moving. More details later.

3) Bad News: Unfortuneately, the commute time from our new house to here
is going to be horrendous, leading me to ...

4) Adieu:  It's been good working with/for/against/along with all of you.
Thanks for the company, but the commute from North Carolina will be a bit
much for me. Yep, the new house is a tad of a distance away. So adieu
and good luck to you all. Two weeks notice is hereby given.

				So long,

					 R

P.S.'s follow.

	My new address (if everything closes properly, etc) is

	My old house is at xxxxxxxxxxx, in xxxxxxxxx. 3 Br., 2 bath,
1300 sq. feet. 129k or so. Atari discounts possible. For further info,
call Linda Couper at (xxx) xxx-xxxx.

	My new job is with General Electric doing some graphics accelerators,
located in the Research Triangle Park near Raleigh, NC.  Believe it or not,
the actual sub-firm I'll be working for (Graphicon) just started 2-3 years
ago, and has by now only 80 (now 81) people in it. I'm hoping it's at least
half as good as the environment here has been.

	I'll miss you all (although obviously for varying reasons...)

Subj:	AS68K Unleash 2.0


	I have just placed an updated copy of AS68K on
Charm and Kim.  There should be no problems with it,  but
if there are,  let me know and meanwhile re-define as68k
to run old_as68k,  which is what I will re-name the old
version.

	One fairly minor feature has been added.  You can
now specify a directory on the filename,  for example:
"as68k [.progs]fred".  The .ol file will end up in the
same directory the source came from.  This is consistent
with the way the old as68k worked if you specified a
"logical device" on the input filespec and left out the
output filespec.  I am open to suggestion on other ways
to handle this,  but will stay "compatible" for now. 

	The new version also correctly reports its exit
status, so your make should terminate if it blows up.

	The only other difference should be about a 20
to 25% speed increase.  Since about a second seems to be
the minimum time (for a 1 line file),  you won't see a
speedup unless you have files that take five or more
seconds now. 

  If I get no complaints by August 15th,  I will delete
the old version.

Subj:	Game Idea?


Name:  Mr. Vice Cop    or    The World, Torch It to Save It

Controls:  Almost non-existant

Game Play:  Fly over jungles and blast the jelly out of little
            make-shift drug factories.  Points are scored not for
            how much drugs were manufactured at each hit location,
            but for whatever inflated figure you decide to award
            yourself.  Bonus points are given for waiting for the
            TV news crews before bombing the peasants back to the
            stone-age.

Objective:  To keep the world from abusing drugs.  As you progress
            through wave after wave more people turn to drugs and
            you get to use bigger weapons.  Eventually you lose.

This is an expensive dedicated game that will cost the operators dearly,
but since the player must coin-up with 100 million quarters per play
the game should pay for itself the first day.

Subj:	68010L8


Signetics had me call Bill Mullins at Magna Sales at 727-8753.

Bill was not in but I got good service from Rebecca.

Rebecca says that Signetics expects to sample their 68010 4Q '86 and have 
production quantities 1Q '87. They promise to be competitive with Motorola 
which, according to Rebecca, is currently the sole source for 68010s.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have been paying about $15 for the 68010L8 (although we have paid
as low as $13.75 .)

From a conversation with Amy Davidson from Motorola on 7/31/86:

She gave the following 68010L8 prices to Melanie Martin:

	 2500		5K		10K
	------		-----		-----
	$23.75		$21.90		$20.35


I told her that I would be making a decision very soon on whether
to use one or two 68010s in a project I was working on (the second
one for audio) and that at $20 I doubted I would use two.

She said that Motorola would be coming out with a Plastic 68010L8
in 1Q '86 for $15 (10K quantity). 

She said something could be worked out so that if they didn't have the
plastic part by then, they would sell us the ceramic part at the
price of the plastic part.

I told her that I did not have the authority to negotiate that kind
of agreement and that I would pass it up the chain of command.


	Jed


p.s. - For a 10 MHz 68010 Motorola wants $34.50 (10K quantity), 
       For a 12 MHz part they want $99 (10K quantity).

Subj:	BABY CARE


Rob Rowe will not be in today.. His sitter quit on him.

Why does not this fine, modern, progressive company provide day care? 

  I myself am fortunate enough not to have children at this time. So I 
personally have no need for daycare (and neither do my children!)  However, 
it seems to me that it makes good business sence to provide at least some 
assistance with the care of the children of Atari personnel.

Reason (1):
	The company has a stake in the welfare of its employees.  It is pretty
obvious that if an employee is streching his/herself and his/her paycheck 
in order to provide for the safe and reliable care for children that that
persons performance will be effected.


Reason (2):
	Companies that provide day care resources are more attractive to future
and current employees.  These companies can pick and choose from a much larger
set of "quality " employees.  


Reason (3):
	By creating a common resource of this type the company brings together
its employees.  This bonding solidifies the company.


Reason (4):
	This type of benifit communicates the companies commitment to its 
employees.  It shows the employee that the company is here to stay and that
while it exists it will care for its people.  This is the type of company
that wins.

I agree with John; day care would be an important plus for Atari and its

would be especially important in attracting and retaining qualified women

      I agree with John Salwitz, Max Behensky and Steve Suttles.  Day care 
would be a very real asset to Atari.  My husband and I haven't any children
at this time but who knows what the future will bring, and judging from the 
number of weddings and engagements we've had recently it looks like many 
of our employees will need this kind of service.  I particularly agree with 
John's point about how a Day Care facility at Atari would create bonds among
our employees.  It would probably do this better than a dozen parties or 
picnics. (Not that we don't need these too.)  There might be other benefits 
too, we'd have a built in group of kids for Focus Tests, if they could reach 
the controls!

Subj:	Deja Vu (Daycare View)


	Once upon a time in a castle named 1501 McCarthy, I started
seriously lobbying for something several of us had discussed back in
1272 (the FIRST time). The idea was that Atari, with some 7000
employees and a soon-to-be-completed "Corporate Campus" bringing
us all together could really benefit from company sponsored daycare.
I don't think anybody at that time felt it should be free, just
subsidized in the same way as the cafeteria, perhaps just by providing
space. Kris's comment about the focus groups was also mentioned, and
even more relevant then, as Atari was heavily into educational uses
of home computers.
	Anyway, there was a lot of support for the idea at my level
and below, and nearly none above me, so I eventually got discouraged
and gave up. It seems wierd to me now to hear it all come up again
just as I am about to become a potential customer. Anyway, if anybody's
counting votes (and if they matter) mine is yes.

Noise pollution - 1 AUG 86:

I have a couple of requests to make and I would like to solicit
any ideas you might have regarding noise pollution.

1) The game labs are inherently noisey, but if it is at all possible please
   keep the controllable noises such as stereos down to modest levels.
   The sounds from the lab seem to readily travel through our thin walls 
   and through the air space above the ceiling. 

2) Don Paauw spends much of his day in intense concentration as he
   mentally juggles the many parameters involved in custom I.C. design.
   Hence, he is particularly susceptible to noise/distraction. Unfortunately,
   his office is the closest to the labs. I would like to ask if any of the
   hardwall office owners (Theurer, Stempler, Salwitz, McCarthy, Ralston,
   Hally) would be willing to trade offices with Don. This is strictly
   a request because I do not feel it is appropriate to demand that someone
   trade. I am willing to trade with Don but he feels that my office is
   just as noisey as his given the proximity to the common area.
   I would arrange for the actual move; the volunteer would not have to do
   the moving.

3) If anyone has any ideas on how to sound-proof the labs or Don's office or
   other clever ideas to solve this problem please let me know...I have tried
   putting 6 inches of fiberglass insulation over Don's office with no
   success.

	Thanks, 
		Chris

	Just some parting info:

Excellent home repair man: "Carter's Home Repair and Maintenance"
				(408) 259-3485
	reasonable rates, easy to work with, honest. Real pleased
with the odd jobs I had him do to get my house ready for sale.
Example: I had a broken pane in then window of my front door. RoadRunner(?)
glass quoted $80 and no responsibility if the rest of the wooden door
broke during the repair (it has 9 lites). Lee Carter repaired it for about
$35, fixed the wood trim, and painted it. Anyway, he did lots of other stuff
and my wife and I are pleased.

Painting: some rambling thoughts:

El Gato - very expensive, slick quick talking salesman does the estimating.
		Dave Shepperd was pleased with the work they did on his house.
		Exteriors only.

Home Sweet Home - almost as expensive. Slow to return calls. The owner does
	the estimating, and talks a good line. Was my second choice. Also
	does interiors.

Mollo's Painting - About half the price for exterior. Same price as
		HSH for interior.
	Did okay work, but nothing fabulous (I had to dig my own trench
around the house so shifting dirt doesn't show old paint color, Gato and 
HSH would have done that for me, etc)

	Gato and HSH seem to use union painters, which may be what affects
their price. Final quality may to be sensitive to the particular crew the 
company sends out.

	Pat McCarthy just had his house painted. When he's less busy,
see him for his ideas.

	Thank you and good bye.

The competition is on a RAMPAGE!

There is word of several new hot products out on the market or in the
distributor sampling stage at the moment.

Probably the hottest item is the new Williams video, PREDATOR.  This is a game
that links four separate cabinets together.  The distributor I spoke to refer-
red to one cabinet being the "master" and the other three as being "slaves";
I'm not sure if this refers to the one master cabinet as being the brains that
drives the others, or if it has something to do with the space-themed game
play.  I checking with some other sources to see if I can find out any further
information.  Operator price is said to be $7000-8000 for the full four-game
system.

Capcom is testing a new game called SPEED RUMBLER (combination of Commando and
Gunsmoke).  According to the testing operator, initial earnings look quite good.
It is on test at an arcade in Scotts Valley.

ACTION FIGHTER the new Sega Spy Hunter rip off may be of special interest to
the Future Vette team.  The player changes vehicles between a car, boat,
helicopter and a motorcycle.  Weapons to use include: mines, flamethrower and
more.  Action Fighter has a new steering controller similar to our flight
controller (but using cheaper components).  There is a foot pedal for
acceleration.

Very positive collection reports continue to come in on Bally/Midway's RAMPAGE.
This is the three-player game that Mary sent out information on earlier.  In one
location the game made $386 in 3.5 days (Time Out in Laurel, MD), the next-best
game was Gauntlet's full-week take of $369.  At a Golfland in southern CA,
Rampage made $637 for its first full week, $585 for its second (Super Sprint has
been averaging about $500 in this location as the #2 game).

That's all for now!                               --Linda

...further information on Williams' PREDATOR:  From two different sources, the
game play looks OK only.  One person said that it appears to be quite difficult,
especially the concept of playing against another player who is on a different
game (remember Subs?).  Each of the four cabinets is named after a bird (Hawk,
Eagle, etc.) and the spaceships are bird-like.  There is a radar screen,
similar to Defender, that players use to find the other players in the game.  II
assume from the descriptions that I have be given that it is a space dogfight
type of game where you are supposed to seek out and destroy the other players.
One source said that it is a scrolling space game similar to Sinistar... the
other source said that game play is different from Sinistar...

One game serves as the main frame and the others are slaves to the main (no
relation to game play).  A player can coin up on any of the four units (the main
frame does not have to be in play to have the others work).

Apparently, Williams is in the early testing stages on this game.  The
distributor I spoke to did not give me a price on the unit, he said that
Williams is trying to determine whether to build it as a whole unit or offer it
as a kit.  The price quoted by another operator is $6500-$7500.

The Sega game, Action Fighter, is out at the Sunnyvale Golfland (for those of
you inclined to take a look at it).

Subj:	Cafeteria Upgrade


If you want to spend some money how about a Satellite Dish System?
A Top-of-the-Line system goes for about $2500 plus installation.
Installation runs from $250 for a simple installation on up to ???

The system can be used for education as well as entertainment. For
example, a few months ago the IEEE broadcast a symposium on Computer
Integrated Manufacturing and last month TI ran the Second Artificial
Intelligence Symposium. Both were on satellite; unscrambled. (The IEEE thing 
was interesting while the TI stuff was Borrrrrring.)

If, in addition to the satellite system, you buy a Videociphor II descrambler
and a subscription a HBO, I ought to be able to determine whether Atari can
second source the Videociphor II without having to pay the MACOM pirates their
outrageous fees. It could make a lot of money for the company.

	Jed

PS - I have some experience in aiming the dish, thereby saving the $250 that
installers charge when they do it.

Subj:	New home video game console from Sega


A Sega consumer game system is up and running in Dave Wiebensons lab.
We have three cartridges : HANG-ON / SAFARI HUNT, WORLD GRAND PRIX and
FANTASY ZONE. The carts use two 27512 proms (and a 13 input nand gate IC 
and a PAL).
This system also uses plastic 'memory cards' for smaller programs. There is 
a slot in the front of the console to slide the card in.

There are two standard Joystick controls (rather like the Nintendo FC 
controls but with the option of a screw-in half inch shaft) and also a 
"light phasor gun" (again, rather like the Nintendo NES system).

A warning on the box and console indicates "Not FCC approved, Not for sale."

Check it out.

Subj:	OCCUPANCY LIGHTING SENSORS FOR 675 & 735


During the first week of September we will start the installation of
occupancy sensors for hardwall offices, conference rooms, restrooms,
and some labs in both buildings.

The contractor has stated that his people will work with us as much
as possible to avoid disruption of our work.

The workers will have to shut the power to the lites when they make
the final tie-in, and this should be 5 to 10 minutes.

Some info on the sensors:

The sensors are activated by motion, similar to the ones we have
in our restrooms.

The lite switches are to remain in the "on" position. ( Our dual
level light switching system will remain in-tack
.... in-tack should read "the same" ).

Approximately 3 to 10 minutes after leaving your area, the lites
will automatically go off.  Once the area is reoccupied, the
lighting is immediately turned on.


Should you have any questions regarding the sensors, contact
your department director or myself.

                                Thanks, Bob

	I'm not sure I understand the need to have these sensors in our
labs and offices to turn our lights out for us.  It seems like this is
something we could do ourselves with very little effort.  If we could learn
to perform this simple task at the end of the day, we wouldn't have to have
our ears bombarded with unnaturally high levels of ultrasonic audio
(I don't know the details on the system we're using, but I believe loud
ultrasonics have been associated with hearing loss, nervous tension, and
ear cancer.  I'd be curious as to the amplitude and frequency of our
system.) 

	Also, with the money we'd save, we could afford that frozen yogurt
machine for the cafeteria.

	I also would like more information on these sensors and 
the mode that they operate.  Are they ultrasonic or infrared?  I've 
already had a few bad experiences with ultrasonic sensors used in 
commercial establishments.  There's already too much noise pollution
in our modern environment and I don't care to subject my senses to 
over nine hours a day of an unwanted ultrasonic transmission.
	I have no trouble flipping a light switch.

Subj:	Sensorship in a Fee Society


1)	In ten years at Atari, I don't recall ever having a
	problem remembering to turn off my light when I went 
	home. Nor do I recall any spate of memos (or even
	one) indicating that many others had any such problem.

2)	When the "debate" over the bathroom sensors was raging,
	the question of increased cost of tube/ballast/starter
	replacement versus decreased cost of electricity was
	raised but never answered.

3)	The concern raised by Earl is valid and deserves an answer.
	We all have "notches" at 15,750 Hz already from all the
	monitors. Will we get new ones and is this a reasonable
	tradeoff versus the "effort" of turning our own lights off?

4)	Will the proposed sensors be installed by the same folks
	who wired the emergency lights wrong and wore out the
	batteries?

5)	In conjunction with the recent "cafeteria upgrade" proposal,
	this seems to be another case of spending money because we
	happen to have some at the moment, rather than in response
	to any pressing	need. Are corporate memories that short?

				Curious,

RE: ULTRASONIC LIGHT SENSORS

OBSERVATIONS:
	1) THESE ARE INTENDED TO TURN OFF LIGHTS IN OFFICES THAT ARE 
	   UNOCCUPIED DURING THE DAY - STUDIES SHOW THIS SAVES ENERGY
	   OVERALL. 
	2) PEOPLE DO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS IN THEIR OFFICES WHEN THEY LEAVE
	   FOR THE EVENING. THIS IT NOT THE MAIN INTENT OF THE SENSORS 
	   ALTHOUGH THEY WILL ACT AS A BACKUP IN THE EVENT OF HUMAN
	   FORGETFULNESS.
	3) I RETURNED TO 675 AT 8:30 PM FRIDAY  8/29 AND OBSERVED:
		A) TWO CARS IN PARKING LOT: HOFF AND THEURER.
		B) ALL HARDWALL OFFICE LIGHTS OFF EXCEPT 
		   HOFF AND THEURER AND STEMPLER (DOOR OPEN SO IT LOOKED
		   LIKE STEMPLER WAS COMING BACK). 
		C) ALPHA LABS - ALL INDIVIDUAL LAB LIGHTS OFF EXCEPT
		   THEURERS LAB AND HORNS LAB (OOPS). ALL LIGHTS IN
		   LAB COMMON AREA ON ( UGH - SENSORS WOULD SHUT THESE OFF)
		D) OMEGA LABS - ALL LIGHTS ON (SENSORS WOULD SHUT THESE OFF)
		E) PRINTER ROOM - LIGHTS OFF, DOOR CLOSED (HARRAH!)
		F) LSI LAB - LIGHT OFF
		G) PROTO-ASSY - LIGHTS OFF, DOORS LOCKED (HARRAH!)
		H) ALL ENGINEERING COMMON AREA LIGHTS ON (SENSORS WOULD NOT
		    TURN THESE OFF - UGH)
		I) GAMES ON IN COMMON AREA (UGH)
		J) TASK LIGHTS ON IN PPS ROOMS (UGH)
OPINION:
	I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SENSORS TOO, BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE
	SOME WASTE OF ENERGY. I WOULD RATHER CONSERVE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
	THAN BUILD NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS TO SUPPORT QUESTIONABLE POWER NEEDS.
	THERE IS ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FOSSIL FUEL; CALIFORNIA ONLY GETS
	10% OF ITS POWER FROM HYDROELECTRIC GERERATION AND THAT COST THE
	LOSS OF SOME BEAUTIFUL WILDERNESS. ULTIMATELY, MORE POWER REQUIREMENTS
	WILL MEAN MORE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS...take your ultra-sonics today

VTI is redesigning the LETA chip for reasons that I won't go into here. As
a result, some specs will change:

1) The data hold time (tOH), the time that the output data are valid after
   the address has changed, is currently spec'ed at a minimum of 30 nS. The
   new parameter will probably be under 20 nS.

2) The TEST pin will become a RESET pin that will zero all the counters for
   betters testability.  The TEST pin was originally intended to feed the
   inputs to the data pins, essentially making the LETA a parallel port.
   However, this function never worked correctly so I don't think the change
   will have any effect.


If anyone knows of any problems these changes may cause, please let me know
by tomorrow, Sep. 5.

Subj:	Sensors Revisited


I was on vacation last week and am only now responding to Chris' message on
the sensors. 

Whether or not we install sensors:

	1. There will not be any more nuclear (fission) power stations built
because, for a variety of reasons, the power companies have found them to
be uneconomical.

	2. I doubt there will be any more hydroelectric plants built in
California because all the rivers that could be dammed economically for hydro 
already have been.

If the company is serious about saving energy:

	1. Install a Solar Energy unit on our (large, flat) roof.

	2. Install a photovoltaic unit on our (large, flat) roof.

	3. Fix the ventilation system.

	4. Use only CMOS in our games.

Think how much energy could be saved if:

	1. The building had been designed to make use of natural sunlight.

	2. The building had been designed so that we could open the windows.

I was amused by Chris' mail message in that he found that most of the lights
that could be turned off were, in fact, turned off, and as a result concluded 
that we needed the sensors after all.

I agree that my note was confusing, but my point was that the sensors are
intended to turn off lights during the day while no one is in there office.
...oops...in THEIR office. I had some lunch conversations where we tried
to calculate the savings: 
	(8) 40-watt tubes per office (320 watts)
	assume people are out of their office 50% of the time (optimisti
	assume 8-hour work day

	calculate: 320*8*50%=1280 watt-hours saved per day

	assume kilowatt-hour costs $.15

	calculate annual dollar savings: .15*1.28*250=$48.

Realistically, maybe only half that is saved annually or about $25.00.

	I talked to Alan Wolff about the Warner Pension Fraud and he explained

that the $97,100 was not covered by the insurance because it was the 

"deductible" and that "they" had decided it was a normal (and customary?) 

business expense to be charged to the Plan.

	He estimated that Atari's share of the Plan was 5% which would come to

$4,855. According to 1984 Form 5500 Line 7a(iv) there were 186 active 

participants which would come to an average of $26.10 each. Assuming an 

average annual rate of return of 10% for the last two years, the amount by 

which Warner has defrauded each Atari employee is $31.58 .

PS - How are they able to add Lines 7a(i) and 7a(ii) and get 186? I always 
thought that 124 + 162 = 286 .

Subj:	NFL FOOTBALL POOL


This message is really directed to the football pool participants
on Ernie.  When you print your pool it automatically prints on
the IT printer.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT
ask it to print.  The paper in the IT printer is too narrow to
fit the whole pool on so it keeps printing on the roller.  The 
printout doesn't do you any good since half of it is cut off.
So what are you supposed to do??????  Rusty says when the program
asks if you want to print it answer NO.  This puts the file in
your directory.  You can then exit NFL.  Then type:
$ COPY FOOTBALL.LIS KIM::TXJ5:

This will send your file to the first printer inside the door
of the printer room in Electrical Eng.

Subj:	Sensors revisited


	I spent several hours in the Stanford med library on Sunday, looking up
effects of ultrasonics.  There isn't a whole lot of research, except on medical
ultrasound (in the megahertz frequency range.)  Effects such as irritability
seem to occur only if you can hear (or feel) the waves (or subharmonics.) 
Effects such as head pain can result from inaudible sound only if the levels
are very high, apparently. 

	Our sensors operate at 25 khz.  The amplitude is 50 dB measured 6
feet from the source.  (I don't know what reference level is used.)

	I'm not sure if there are federal regulations on ultrasonics in this
range.  There is a proposal of limits at 80 dB for the 10-16 khz range,
increasing to 105 dB at 20 khz and 110 dB at 25 khz.  Assuming the same
reference level, the 110 dB limit is 1000 times higher than the amplitude of
our sensors (at 50 dB.) 

	My initial fear was that, since these frequencies are generally
inaudible, a manufacturer would feel free to use very high levels to increase
reliability.  One person mentioned experiencing head pain from exposure to
motion sensors in various businesses, but the frequency was in a semi-audible
range, and the amplitude was probably much higher.  Manufacturers have probably
lowered the levels in recent years.  No one has mentioned experiencing any
problems from the sensors we have installed in our game and rest rooms. 

	I would guess that the horizontal oscillator frequency of certain video
monitors is BY FAR the worse offender.  It would be interesting to measure
various monitors to see if they are under the proposed threshold limit.  (They
probably are, but who knows.)  High frequencies are very directional, so some
simple shielding (a monitor enclosure) should reduce the problem.  If you are
bothered by this (if that sound EARitates you), do something about it. 

	In conclusion, there seems to be 2 kinds of people - those who assume
that what you can't see or hear won't hurt you, and those paranoids like me who
assume that what you can't see or hear will hurt you much worse than what you
can see or hear, and will eventually kill you.  In the case of ultrasonics, the
currently available evidence seems to support the non-paranoids.  If your ears
object to these frequencies, they will probably let you know.

	The goal of energy conservation is an extremely desirable one.  I had
hoped there might be a simpler, less technological way of achieving this goal,
but old habits are slow to change.

	I hasten to add that the audio group ALWAYS turns its lights out at
night, and frequently during lunch, etc. as well.  So if anyone wants two
sensors for their office, we may have some extras!

Subj:	Lighting Sensors


Recently, there has been a series of comments regarding the lighting
sensors we are planning to install in both 675 and 735.  The Watt-Watcher
system was selected because of its ability to control lighting in a 
specific designated area while still giving the user full control of his
or her lighting.  The primary purpose of this system is to turn off the
lights when people are absent from their offices for extended periods
of time during the work day ie., at a meeting in a conference room,
in the lab, during lunch etc.  It has a secondary purpose for those
individuals who forget to turn off their lights at the end of the day.

This system meets the emission standards set by all state, federal
and international agencies, including:
                     Cal OSHA standards
                     California Energy Commission
                     California Department of Health Services
                     Environmental Protection Agency
                     World Health Council standards.

The output of this system is about 50 db at a distance of six feet from
the sensor.  A quiet office with air conditioning will have sound levels
in the 50 to 58 db range.  The sensors that we are installing have a 
frequency of 25Khz so as to prevent any possibility of being heard.
To date over 10,000 sensors have been installed in the silicon valley
area.

Electricity is our most costly utility, being three times the cost of 
all other utilities combined.  Our electrical bills average $17,200
per month.  Lighting accounts for 50% of this cost.  We have 
conservatively estimated that the sensors will reduce our lighting
costs by at least 5%.

Additionally, we also get a PG&E rebate for installation of the 
sensors and a federal energy tax credit.  With this the overall
cost becomes quite reasonable to Atari.

You may still have further concerns or questions.  If so, please 
contact Bob Frye or myself and we'll try to answer your questions.

I hope that based on the above information, you can give us your
full cooperation.

Regards

Dennis

Subj:	Paper Boy Manual


I realize that this might be a little late to do much good but --

I have just discovered that the monitor called out in the Paper Boy
Manual on page 5-3 (Picture) and 5-4 (Parts List) is incorrect.

The monitor that is called out is 139003-1006 which is a normal
resolution (normal speed) monitor whereas Paper Boy actually used a
medium resolution (Medium Speed) display like a 139012.

If someone orders a replacement monitor from the parts list he will get one 
that won't work in the game.

There's a new compiler on Kim and Charm (V4.3). You may VU the release
notes located in SYS$HELP:BLS16043.RELEASE_NOTES to see what has been
fixed. We're doing a field test of this compiler and as such I have a
direct line (via modem) to the developers. Any bugs (or undocumented
features) found in the compiler past and the future should be brought
to my attention right away so I can tell the developers.

Should there be a severe problem that prevents your program from
compiling but the old one worked, you can get the old compiler
back by doing:

	$ DEFINE BLISS16 SYS$SYSTEM:BLISS16.041	!version 4.1

Subj:	COMPETITOR UPDATE


This message is sent out to JUNK, not just ENGINEERING 'cuz I figured
several people not on the ENGINEERING distribution may be interested in some
competitor information.  If you do not want to read about some new games due
from our competitors you can stop reading right here.


It's definitely football season out there...


After reading in the October RePlay that Sente will debut a new game at the
AMOA called "Street Football," we figured further research was warranted.
According to a (reliable) source, the game is 1- or 2-player simultaneous
with track ball controllers.  Players can select a receiver who runs his own
pattern, dodging cars and trucks, etc.  It will be a kit for their SAC I
system and sell for $395.

Sente says that they are now testing "out of state" and that is why we have
not seen their football game around here.  Not that I doubt the word of this
reputable source, but its more likely that the game has not been out on
field test yet.  Keep your eyes and ears open, you may hear of this game out
on test locally before the show; if you do, let me know 'cuz we'd like to
see it.

The contact at Sente also said that Cinematronics will also be be showing a
football game at the show.  Considering the great job they did with their
baseball game, World Series, this could be the one to watch out for.

Sega has another expensive simulator game game, "Out Run," which they will
show in Japan next week and at the AMOA (operators could buy two real cars
for the price of this one!).  Atari may end up building this game for Sega
in Europe, but then again, maybe not.  It's a Hang On-type driving simulator
with the player sitting in a scale model fiberglass Ferrari car that moves
according to the action on the screen (as you steer left the back end of the
car move right, etc.).  The game is supposed to have a feedback steering
control...but not having actually played it, we don't know how "feedback" it
really is; we're sure to get a full report after the Japan show.  (For the
price...$8,000+...where's the feedback clutch and shifter?)  The game puts
the player up against other hot cars (Corvettes, Porsches, etc.) that must
be out-run (thus the name of the game).  It is supposed to have a few nifty
features...like being able to tune in the background music you want by
dialing the radio.  Another (great) idea is that the player sees a good-
looking blonde get into the car beside him as he coins up (personally, this
really doesn't turn me on, unless the blonde is about 6' 2" and otherwise
looks like Tom Cruise).

And speaking of Tom...Konami is advertising their new "Top Gunner" kit: A
two-player simultaneous tank game with a buy-in feature.

There are also ads and hints about all sorts of new games and kits from
other manufacturers in the October RePlay.  One thing that is interesting to
me this year is that several manufacturers are releasing (or planning to
release) their new games now, just before the show.  There may be a few
surprises at the AMOA, but probably not many (e.g. Tradewest supposedly has
a hot sequel to their Ikari Warriors).  Getting samples of a good game out
to stir interest before the show is a good sales technique...it worked with
Gauntlet!

If you have any fun facts about what's going on in the field, let me know.
I plan on doing an update on this info. after the Japan show and befor the
AMOA.

That's all for now!

Subj:	Summit


In the annals of history, today may be remembered as the time
when the earth tottered on the brink of peace, and fell back
into the abyss of an uncontrolled nuclear arms race.  Consider 
what was offered to Reagan in Iceland: A 50% cut in balistic missiles
over the next 5 years with a goal of TOTAL ELIMINATION within
ten.  COMPLETE REMOVAL of all medium range nuclear missiles from
Europe and a limit of only 100 launchers in Asia.  Given the
recent concessions by the Soviets regarding on-site verification,
cheating by either side would be virtually impossible.  

What price would the US have to pay to drastically reduce the nuclear 
threat to human civilization? Just that Star Wars be confined to 
laboratory research for the next ten years, and that any deployment
after that time be subject to negotiation between the US and USSR.
Sadly for humanity, Reagan refused to give up his pipe dream of
an invulnerable shield for the US, and the summit ended in failure.
Reagan's position is incomprehensible if you accept his rhetoric
that SDI is a "purely defensive" shield for the US population;
what's the point of Star Wars if the missiles it is designed to
shield against are eliminated?  On the other hand, it makes perfect
sense if what Reagan is after is a shield to enhance the possibility
of a sucessful US first strike against the Soviets.  

Reagan's positon is not one that that the Russians could possibly
accept, at least if they have any sense.  He wants both the US and
Russia to reduce their arsenals, while the US develops and tests
a defensive system.  Then, just at the time when we have a partially
effective defense complete, Russia's stockpile would be
reduced to the point where Star Wars might have some chance of success
and we could wipe them out with relative impunity with our remaining
warheads.  It's like a party to a Mexican standoff sugessting: "To
increase our security let's both get rid of all our bullets but one,
and meanwhile I'll put on this bulletproof vest". 

All I can hope for is that Gorbachev lasts in power until 1988 and
that a more reasonable man replaces the extremely dangerous
president we have now.  Reagan had a chance to end the arms race
and blew it; lets hope we all survive long enough for wiser heads
to prevail.

From everything I've read, technologists say that SDI will never work.
Isn't it interesting that the soviets are willing to give up so much
to stop something that will never work? Maybe Reagan wants the Soveits
to give up more than just 50% of their arsenal in the next 5 years.
Wouldn't it be amazing if Reagan can get the Soviets to make a really
major concession for fear of something that would never work anyway?
I don't think I would want to play poker with Reagan.

I don't think SDI could ever protect the US from the USSR or the
USSR from the US.  Neither would continue to exist, politically if
not physically, if either decided to attack with nukes.  SDI, if it
ever works, just might protect both from a nuclear terrorist, who
has an interest in seeing the whole world go belly-up.

The failure at the summit was in being able to trust on another 
just a little bit.  Reagan's administration thinks the USSR wants
to govern the US, and the USSR thinks the US wants to govern them,
when each already is stretched to the limit.  We must find a way
to work together to protect the whole world from real threats.

There is considerably more in common between the two nations than
each wants to admit.

Personally, I don't believe that the USSR is really willing to flush their
nukes just because some lab bat shot a hole in the wall (and on the other hand
I have read printed rumors that NASA has done SDI tests that only involve smart
missles in space based clusters) but I do believe that the USSR probably knows
more about the actual potential of SDI than the US public because they are
willing to spend large amounts of cash to find out what we are really up to.
Just the fact that they have made such a radical offer indicates that their
intelligence has told them that SDI is real. I don't think that they would just
take Mr. Ronnie's word for it (and will someone please tell me why the
President is announcing to the world what our defense engineers are doing in
the lab?) and you can bet that they are developing one of their own. Our
President is quoted as saying "In god we trust, all others pay cash" in Russian
at the summit which shows what a pinhead he really is. He should be removed

advance. I don't believe the pop technoligists who doubt that star wars will
work because even Albert Einstein said MAN WILL NEVER SEE THE INSIDE OF THE

mean it could have been MC**2.0139576 or even MC**300,069**1.0594631. And what
ever happened to nuclear winter anyway? Does anyone really believe that
implementing star wars and pushing the button will only destroy the USSR? How
can hundreds of cities be destroyed and not affect the rest of the world? The
USSR offer is bogus and had we aggreed to their terms they would still build
more nukes and even more strongly consider to use them. And now for even more

A lot of messages on the system have used the following argument: "If
Star Wars doesn't work, why are the Russians afraid enough of it that
they are willing to give up 50% of their balistic missiles to prevent
the US from testing it over the next 10 years?".  The fallacy here is
that SDI does not have to work very well to pose a severe threat to
Russia's security.  A very "leaky" space defense system would not
protect the US population in any meaningful sense from a massive
Russian first strike attack, but could easily fend off the weakened
retaliation to a US first strike against Soviet strategic targets.
Star Wars, in direct contradiction to Reagan's rhetoric, is effectively
an offensive system which could allow the US to destroy Russia with
reduced casualties.

Obviously the Russians can not accept the US being able to destroy
them with relative impunity.  The US developed nuclear weapons in
the first place, is the only nation in the world to have used them
in anger, and consistently has refused to adopt a policy of "no first
use" for these weapons.  Authoritative sources have documented
many times since world war II when US presidents have seriously
considered using nuclear weapons in regional conflicts, the last by
Richard Nixon in Vietnam.  Given this history, why should they
trust us with their lives?  As I see it, they have four options
at this point:

1.  Try to negotiate an end to SDI development before a system
is deployed.  If they offer, as they have, the mutual elimination
of the missiles that SDI is designed to protect against, there is
no legitimate reason for the US to not agree.  This is the best
option for the Russians, the American people, and humanity at
large.

2.  Try to develop a SDI system of their own.  Since they lag far
behind in most of the necessary technologies, especially computation
and intelligent computer software, this is not very viable.  The
Russians could easily wind up bankrupting their country in a
race where if you come in second you are completely at the
mercy of your opponent.

3.  Embark on a massive nuclear buildup to overwhelm any possible
defense system.  Star Wars is very expensive and completely
speculative, while nuclear weapons are fairly cheap and known to
work.  This aproach will be tough for the USSR given their
economic condition, but if they feel their lives depend on it
they will take it, and the world will take another step toward
ultimate disaster.

4.  If SDI looks like it will work, the Soviets can't build
up fast enough to be sure of overwhelming it, and the US won't
negotiate the Russians have a final option.  The destruction
they would experience from the retaliation to a USSR first strike
made before SDI is operational would be small compared to that
from a US first strike afterward.  Especially in a time of 
international tension, the temptation to cut their losses by
wiping us out before it's too late for them could be overpowering.

Gorbachev proposed solution #1 in Iceland.  Hopefully hearts
will change and it will be accepted, or we'll see some combination
of 2,3, or 4 over the next decade.

Subj:	Russian "call my bluff"??


Another way of looking at this situation (Not necessarily my way of seeing it)
is that the Russians believe that Reagan will not negotiate SDI at all.

   Therefore they can offer the world, with utter conviction that their bluff 
will never be called. Thus they are in a position to say to the world:-
"Look what we offered, and the Americans turned down, Now whose the bad guy?".

   It would seem to be a great publicity coup for the current "good image"
hungry administration of the USSR.


Maybe that is why its called Russian roulette??

Subj:	RE:summit BLOW OUT


First strike? Successful first stike? A successful first strike in the arena of
nuclear war means wiping out every single nuke of your opponent and somehow
sealing off your whole country's environment from the rest of the world. If
only a few of the opponents nukes survive your 'first strike' they can destroy
every non-shielded electrical device (every car, radio, computer, etc.) with
the EMP from just 2 or 3 well placed nukes above your country as well as blind
every unprotected animal. Just blinding the non-human animals will effectively
destroy some or not all of the world's ecology. So even if you blast all of the
other guy's nukes the radio-toxic smog from your 'succesfully' destroyed
opponent could block out the sun for as much as a year. The US arsenal could
cause this effect 100 times over. If you somehow conduct a 'clean' attack (with
no blinding flashes) then the contamination of the world's air and seas from
the opponent's destroyed industries could make survival very interesting for
quite some time. But still who can say that the clean destruction of a country
could not ultimately destroy the world's ecology? In the case of the 'first
strike' the winner suffers the most and the loser dies quite humainly (well
most of them anyway). 

So can the USSR get their own 'Star Wars'? There is an article on my office
wall that says they can and cheaply. Is it propaganda? Probably.

CORRECTION: Comrade Albert actually said that science would never crack open
the atom. If Comrade Albert can be wrong then so can the people who say that
SDI won't work. (and then again maybe not) If it does work can it get every
single nuke? What about short range missles from submarines that never become
ballistic? Could the actual use of SDI be to keep civilian populations in line? 

The invention of nuclear weapons was an accidental stroke of good luck to a
country that was tired of fighting WWII. The responsible scientists were
inspired by the unbelievable actions of Mr. Adolph and unfortunately another
country got the package meant for him. I do not believe that the USSR has
considered the limited use of nukes less than the US. I believe we just know
less about what their leaders say in private. 

So let the USSR go bankrupt building more nukes or their own 'star wars'
and let the US continue the develop and implement SDI. The research could
have valuable side effects (such as in body viewing of molecules with the
X-ray laser) and the USSR won't push the button if they can't instantly
vaporize US (regardless of whether they believe they'll live happily ever
after).

	Maybe it's time we stopped asking questions like, "will Star Wars
really work?" and started asking the important questions.  Like, "How do we
sign up for those big defense contracts?" 

	I know this is going to be a little controversial, but I'm proposing
that Atari offer to write the software for the SDI project. 

	Few people realize it, but we are one of the leaders in this field.
We wrote the very first Star Wars software, and it worked perfectly.  We have a
great deal of expertise in the areas of collision detection and tracking of
motion objects.  We have done precise and detailed simulations of
anti-ballistic-missile warfare.  And top military and government leaders
seem to feel that the implementation of SDI software is as simple as, say,
adding a few (hundred million) extra lines of code to our Missile Command
software. 

	Since the name "Atari" might be a handicap for this particular
application, I suggest we bring back our Kee Games subsidiary.  This has the
added advantage that if the software doesn't work right the first time, it
won't damage Atari's reputation. 

	Frankly, I think we all know that a lot of the companies who are out
there raking in big SDI bucks would never be able to survive in the kind of
rough-and-tumble competitive marketplace which we thrive on.  Would you feel
any safer if the software for SDI were written by Lockheed or McDonnell
Douglas?  I know I wouldn't.

Subj:	The SDI Solution


Critics of the proposed SDI system have charged that it will require
the extensive use of computers with millions of lines of code which will 
never be completely tested unless the system is actually used.

Also, the system would somehow have to deal with new threats (new weapons)
which it was not pre-programmed to recognize.

There is a solution to this problem which Atari is uniquely able to provide.

Under an appropriate Defense Contract Atari could set up special "arcades",
starting with one in each major U.S. city. These "arcades" would contain
"video games" which would in actuality be running a simulation of the SDI
system. The consoles could be connected to have player versus player or
the entire "arcade" could be operated as a team, playing the teams in other
cities.

The kids will find all the bugs and figure out strategies that the SDI planners
had never considered.The activities will be appropriately monitored so that 
these bugs (and new strategies) can be recognized and applied to the real SDI 
system.

These centers can also help by identifying talented perspective personnel.

The cost to the players will be the same as other video games. (If they
were on Free Play the kids would get quickly bored.)

The Russians will have their agents spend time in these centers to test
the capabilities of the system. Good. The monitoring equipment will detect
any successful new strategies.

PS - I hope the "real" SDI system can point away from the earth as well as
     toward it. It would be really terrific if we were invaded by creatures
     from space and had a defense system that we couldn't turn around. 
     Like a kind of cosmic Maginot Line.

Fellow Parents and Parents-to-be:

This is an informal initial poll of Atarians who would currently,
or at some future time, be interested in an on-site or nearby day care
facility for infants and pre-school aged children.

1. Do you currently have an infant or child in day care?

2. Are you planning to add (another) child to your family within the next 
year or two and forsee a future need for a day care facility?

I plan on taking a true census of all permanent employees at a later
date, but for now I'd like to find out how many of you out there in 
VAXland would utilize a day care center if it were offered onsite or nearby
Atari.  As we are scheduled to move to a new location in a year or two, 
now is a great time to start planning for this.

Please reply to this address as to your current and potential future
need for day care.  Thanks!

Subj:	Mixit, DIO, IMI, DOWNC, DOWND and LLF


Apologies to the 720 team, I got a little ahead of myself releasing MIXIT
before its time.

While developing LLF v2, I decided that I needed to replace the .LDA
file format with one that is more effecient (spelled: f-a-s-t-e-r). Enter
the new and improved .VLDA format. Indeed, the output phase of LLF runs
a little better than twice as fast as it does while generating a .HEX
file and the .VLDA file size itself is about 1/3 the size of the .HEX
file. The problem with this is that, as the 720 team so rudely found out,
MIXIT, DIO, IMI, DOWNC and DOWND had to be fixed to allow the .VLDA as an
input and to use ".VLDA" as a default input and output file type.

Anyway, now its done. If you don't explicitly specify a file type on the input
or output of any of the utilities, a default file type of .VLDA will be assumed.
However, on input, all the utilities will change the default input to .LDA if
the .VLDA file cannot be found. This should prevent the problem that the 720
team had and should also keep any existing command files from "breaking".

In case anyone's intrested, the .VLDA format will also encompass the .OBJ format
generated by the new and improved MAC65 (whenever I get that done) and will be
able to be re-input to LLF for additional linking if necessary. The object
output of the BLISS compiler is the same format as the .VLDA so it can be input
directly to LLF without doing the assembly step. Anyone doing system II programs
want to sign up as beta test site? It appears that LLF is going to be neither
faster nor slower than LINKM, but it will afford a lot more flexibility in
dealing with overlays as well as removing the restriction of 6 char filenames
and stuff.

Subj:	MORE COMPETITOR INFORMATION


Thanks to our new eyes and ears in Chicago we have heard a few good rumors
to pass on.  Actually, our new Sales Manager, Frank Cosentino, has seen a
some new pieces out on location and has given us a run down as follows:

Konami has a two-player simultaneous video out on test called Rock and Roll.
The story behind the game is that the lead singer of a band is captured and
the guitar player and drummer go out and search for him.  (At the beginning
of the game, a big hand comes down and takes the lead singer away.)  The
playfield is a three-quarter view ala Gauntlet.  The players pick up musical
notes and other music-oriented things for weapons, etc.  Apparently, a
guitar is used as a gun...and other logical things like that.  The
characters in the game are large, two inches tall.  Reportedly, Rock and
Roll is not doing so well on test; Konami has taken several of the units out
of the test sites after only a short time on location.

Konami is also working on their first home-grown effort.  Super Basketball
is a two-player simultaneous game designed here in the U.S.  Using button
controls, players can jump and shoot, tribble, steal, pass and switch the
ball.  Basically, this is a remake of their original Super Basketball.

Bally has a new three-player video called Power Drive.  Players select from
three different monster trucks.  The game is in a Rampage-style cabinet with
Track and Field-type controls that are big buttons that look like tires.
There is a wheelie button and a 2-or 4-wheel drive shifter.  The screen
scrolls horizontally as players compete on a straight race course.  There is
an initial buy-in feature, dubbed as a $1000 entry fee.  Power Drive is said
to be a very physical game to play.

Bally also has a new pin game called Strange Science.  It is supposed to
have a very busy playfield with lots of ramps, bells and whistles but fewer
skill shots than the new Williams pin (see below).  Apparently this action
on this game is more random than skill.

Williams Pinbot is reputedly their best effort ever...even better than High
Speed.  There are five targets at the back of the game that correspond to a
grid of lights.  When all the lights are lit, a cover comes off of a robot-
like thing in the center.  The players next objective is to capture two
balls in the eye sockets...Sounds pretty bizzar to me.

Premier's new pin, Goldwing is an airport-themed game with a real siren.

Taito has a 4-player upright soccer game called Kick and Run.  The cabinet
on this one is similar to Quartet.

Kitcorp/Sun has licensing deal in the works with Sega to produce a 2-player
universal Quartet kit.  What will they call this...Duet, maybe?

This (along with my previous message on Sente's Street Football, another
football game from Cinematronics, etc.) could be a pretty good preview of
the AMOA, we'll see.

Subj:	MIXIT once again


Due to popular demand, MIXIT can now output a file suitable for assembly by the
68000 assembler. The file type is .ASM. The code is not inserted in any
particular section nor is the PC set to anything (it could be "included" by a
different module. The code is placed in DC.B statements, 16 bytes per line
unless otherwise specified (with the /REC=n qualifier). Blank spaces are skipped
with the DS.B directive. To date there are now 8 different output formats that
can be created by MIXIT (and DIO/IMI uploader) and 6 input formats that can be
read by MIXIT (and DOWNC/DOWND and DIO/IMI programs). 

The first two formats must be output only (MIXIT won't read them properly):
	$ MIXIT
	>OUT filename.ASM  !or filename.bla_bla/ASM  68k assem format
	>OUT filename.MAC  !or filename.bla_bla/MAC  MAC65 assem format
The remaining formats can be either output or output:
	>OUT filename.DLD  !or filename.bla_bla/DLD  MOStech load format
	>OUT filename.HEX  !or filename.bla_bla/TEK  Extended TEKHEX format
	>OUT filename.ROM  !or filename.bla_bla/ROM  Atari .ROM format
	>OUT filename.LDA  !or filename.bla_bla/LDA  DEC LDA format
	>OUT filename.VLDA !or filename.bla_bla/VLDA Atari VLDA format

VLDA is the default input and output type.

	>OUT filename.anything_else !or filename/IMAGE binary image format

	LATE LAST NIGHT I FINISHED A THREE NIGHT ROOM-PAINTING PROJECT
AND THIS MORNING MY HOUSE DOESN'T SMELL OF PAINT.
	HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
	I HAVE BEEN USING A LITTLE TRICK FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT 
WORKS WONDERS. WHEN YOU FIRST OPEN A CAN A PAINT, STIR IN A SPOONFULL
OF VANILLA. THEN PAINT AWAY. SOMEHOW IT CUTS THE PAINT SMELL.

			    HELLO, HELLO!!

Today is International Hello Day (I'm not kidding).  The heads of state of
sixty eight countrys have approved this day as Hello Day, in an effort to
promote world peace and good will.  How does it work?  "Well..."  Just say
Hello to 10 different people today and you would have done your civic duty.

And since there are Hellos at the top of this mail message, if only 10 of
read this, I did my part.  If 20 read this, think of the good karma I have
comming to me.  If 30 read this, I may go into politics.  "Nancy, say Hello".

						Goodbye,

This is a special HelloDay "Hello."  It is a part of a world wide electronic
Hello Campaign.  Please make 20 copies of this hello and send them to your
friends.  It is very important that you keep the chain going so that the world
won't end at midnight tonight.

A woman at IBM in Austin, Texas passed on this hello this morning. At noon, 
she heard from the IRS taht they were giving her a $500 refund.  A man in
Pomona, California typed in the hello on CompuServe and found out an hour
later taht he was a $1000 instant winner in the lottery.

An elderly clerk at the Santa Clara County Medical Center in San Jose failed
to pass on the "hello" and had a heart attack at 9:23am this morning.  A man
in Seattle, Washington ignored the "hello" that came to him at 11:34am PST and
died at 11:52 when a Boeing 767 landed on the roof of his car as he was driving
to lunch.  A bag lady in New York City ignored the hello she saw on the
Time of Day sign in front of Chase Manhatten Bank, and was promptly mugged
and robbed of her bag.

You should also send 25 cents to the first 3 people at the top of the 
"Forwarded from" list at the beginning of this message.  Hurry and pass this
"hello" along so the world won't end tonight.

  ***********************************************************************

    Early this summer I received from MARC Software International a copy of
the greatly revised WordMARC Composer word processing program (formerly
called Muse).  This program runs on Ernie SlowVAX.  Finally the program can
be accessed by anyone with a VAX user account on Ernie.  Even if your ter-
minal or personal computer is hooked up to another VAX, you can still use
the word processor through the network.  You merely need a user account
created for you on Ernie (see Dave Shepperd).  In other words, if you're
reading this VAXmail message on a terminal or PC, YOU can use WordMARC
Composer.

    Just a reminder for potential users in the Manufacturing building: there
are no letter-quality printers in the 735 building.  However, you can send
your printing request to a printer in 675, but you have to come over to pick
up your output.

     I will hold a short introductory class in WordMARC Composer on Wednes-
day, Dec. 3rd, from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Central Conference Room in Bldg. 675.
To encourage more use of this word-processing program, everyone interested
is invited to attend.  For clear viewing, a large-screen projection TV will
display how the program works.

    Combining the usual functions such as insert, delete, copy, move, cen-
ter, indent, spell-checking, search & replace, automatic hyphenation, etc.,
WordMARC Composer also has the following features (this is a partial
listing):

1.   WordMARC supports all VAX terminals we use.

2.   WordMARC outputs to all daisy-wheel printers we have, and practically
     all line printers.  It supports bold, underlining, and justified
     (flush) margins.

3.   Continuous file scrolling -- move text up or down by two-thirds of a
     screen, or move text one line at a time.

4.   A single keystroke activates most functions.

5.   Document (file) profiles -- detailed information such as subject of
     document, names of author and preparer, date and time document created
     and changed, and number of pages and lines in it.

6.   Exact copying -- choose the exact text that you want to copy into your
     current file from another file.  Before you were limited to the whole
     file or nothing.

7.   Help capability -- gives messages about the function you are using at
     the moment (or any other function).

8.   Footnote and endnote capability.  (Endnotes are "footnotes" placed at
     the end of a document instead of at the bottom of each page.)

9.   Automatic index and table of contents generation

10.  List processing -- the former mail-merge capability has been retained,
     allowing you to send the same letter to many people.  In addition, you
     can create a database and sort it many different ways.  For instance,
     you could send a letter to all operators doing business in California.

11.  Automatic paragraph or section numbering in a variety of styles

12.  Document deletion and renaming within the program -- also allows you to
     see a list of files in any unprotected directory while in the program.

13.  Selective document encryption -- other users cannot read the contents
     of your documents.  If they call up your file on the screen without
     using the proper password, they will see only an alphabet soup of
     random garbage.

14.  Switching between 80- and 132-column mode within the program -- no need
     to keep your terminal at the hard-to-read 132-column setting if most of
     your work is less than 80 columns wide.

15.  WordMARC can read and print ASCII files.

     In a previous VAXmail message, I mentioned that the WordMARC Composer
Full Documentation Set is available from MARC Software for $55.00.  This
beautifully prepared set competes in quality with any of the better
microcomputer software manuals.  The boxed set consists of the following
five items:
     1.  Reference Guide -- a complete description of WordMARC functions
     2.  Learning WordMARC -- a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial
     3.  Your Computer -- the basics of the VAX in relation to WordMARC,
         such as length of filenames allowed, several commands at the
         operating system level, etc.
     4.  Quick Guide -- a brief summary of WordMARC functions
     5.  One set of function key labels

     An alternative Quick Package is available for $9.50 and consists of the
following two items:
     1.  Quick Guide
     2.  One set of function key labels

No other combination of these manuals is available for sale.

     If you would like a copy of the Full Documentation Set or the Quick
Package, send your request via VAXmail to ERNIE::OHARA or bring your orders
to James O'Hara as soon as possible.  List the type of sets, quantities, and
dept. and acct. number to be charged.  James will order and then distribute
the sets when they arrive.

     If your department's budget was so carefully planned that you do not
have an extra $55 or two, and you REALLY feel you need the Full Documenta-
tion Set, there is a source available in Engineering to help you pay for it.
Contact Dave Shepperd at CHARM::SHEPPERD.

                  NOTE FOR CURRENT USERS OF MUSE/WORDMARC:
     Files you have already created with Muse are completely readable
     with the new WordMARC Composer.  However, once you have refiled
     them using WordMARC Composer, you can no longer call them up using
     the older Muse/WordMARC program.  Besides, that program won't be
     available for use 12 hours after the class is held.

        Also, you probably already know that the default file extension
     is .MUS.  For WordMARC Composer, the default is changed to .WM.
     You should be aware that all of your .MUS files will be renamed to
     .WM during the night of Dec. 3-4.  If this poses a problem for
     you, notify Steve Suttles at KIM::SUTTLES.
                                                    Andrea

By the way, the WordMARC word processing program is also available for the
IBM PC and compatibles.

	The experiences (effects) were internal head pain while being
subjected to the sound and severe headaches for up to four hours afterward.
The 'sound' is more of a sensation in the head than the typical sense of
hearing.
Now, when I encounter these devices, I immediately leave the place of business.
It's been a couple of years since my last encounter, so maybe they have
developed
more sofisticated sensors that use much lower power (but I still do a quick
retreat
from the horizontal oscillators of many TV sets).

Subj:	Own a piece of history!


	I'm cleaning out my garage and while I'm not quite ready to get rid
of the Whizzer, the Flexowriter, or the blacksmith's vise, I have decided to
pass Doctor Pong on to a new owner. No, this is not some kindly old G.P. that
lives in my garage, but a rare specimen of a product that didn't quite make it.
The idea was to package PONG (the original coin-op product) in a small cabinet
with a start button instead of a coin switch. Doctors were supposed to buy the
things and put it in their waiting rooms to entertain those patients who still
had use of their eyes and hands. Why a doctor who hadn't even paid for his
Reader's Digest subscription since 1956 would spend a couple hundred bucks on
such a thing is beyond me but let's get on with it.

	This thing is about the size of an industrial grade breadbox and of
"contemporary styling" (roughly contemporary with the AMC Gremlin) finished in
imitation woodgrain and black. If you remember Star Trek episode "Is there in
truth no beauty?", about the Medusan ambassador and the blind lady... well,
picture the ambassador's box and you have the general idea. 

	I don't have the original monitor (never did), but it used a 12" B/W
Motorola, and I will throw in one of those, scavenged from one of the old test
jigs. Two problems, you may need to cobble some brackets and the monitor I have
has developed problems related to sweep (I haven't fired it up in so long I
don't remember whether it was horizontal or vertical). That's about it for the
bad news, as the logic board worked last time I hooked it up to a working
monitor. Anyway, it probably could be put in near-mint condition in an evening
by someone used to working on TVs (a group which does not include me).

	I just know that someone out there NEEDS this priceless reminder of our
heritage, and so it shall be truly priceless! First VaxMail reply takes it,
FOB the parking lot.

Subj:	RE:  Improving our wire-wrap board
	I think it would be worth while for someone to investigate improving our
standard wirewrap board and to me that means fielding positive and negative
comments about our current, standard board and looking at the products that are
commercially available as potential replacements and as a source of ideas if we
decide again to build our own. 
	It is not clear to me that a 4 layer board would be an improvement in 
a system with only two supply rails.  A 4 layer production board allocates 
two layers to signals and two to power.  The wirewarp board should be able to 
allocate two layers of a two layer board to power, there are no signal lines to 
compete for space. When I first read you message I though "Great, 4 layers 
means cleaner power and ground."  But that may not be true for a wirewrap. 
	An improvement that I would like to see is the ability to accept 
socketting for the PLCC packages.  This means a 0.1" center grid of unconnected
holes.  Currently there is a region from A1 to D16 connected in a way for
which I do not understand the benefit.  
	I hope that who ever takes on the task has a clear idea of why
he/she is making the changes and communicates the reasons to the rest of us
before charging on to film and fab.  With a little effort from a lot of people 
and moderate effort from a few we should be able to build/buy a better 
wirewrap board and avoid the pitfalls of a committee design.

As indicated I am in favor of the 4 layer wirewrap board. Care must be 
taken as to where the power and ground points surface for connection to 
ICs. The board must have provision for .156 headers, 60 way ribbon 
connectors, and the standard assortment of IC sockets. Some provision for 
pin grid arrays is also required.

As with the previous one we should include a provision for .4" spacing

board be able to implement prototypes of the complexity of system 3D's ?

Subj:	Everything you wanted to know about the AMS download and then some


File:	CHARM::[LOGG.AMS]DNL.DOC
Date:	12/5/86

	There is a new AMS fast download program available for public use.
There is no need to give up compatibility with old HEX files.  The new 
downloader will still support extended TEK HEX files.  To get the new 
downloader do the following:
	1. Burn 2 27128-2 EPROMs from the file CHARM::[LOGG.AMS]U55U56D128.LDA
	   starting at 4000 and ending at BFFF.  Label them LOGG-U55 and
	   LOGG-U56 with the current date.  Please label the outside of the
	   AMS so that we do not send the AMS out for service with these 
	   EPROMs.  
	2. Replace the new U55 and U56 EPROMs with the ones in the AMS.  They
	   can be found on the PCB connected to the ribbon cable.  On power
	   up you will notice that there are CRC errors.  Please ignore these.
	   When I know how to CRC the EPROMs I will release a new version.
	3. In your LOGIN.COM file define the symbol DNL.  Please see the DOWND
	   documentation if you need more information.  For example, it is
	   possible to tell DOWND to download several files at once.  More
	   importantly one can tell DOWND not to load all the uninitialized
	   data by specifying the starting and ending addresses.
		DNL :== MCR DOWND /DELAY=0 /RECORD=250 /ADD=start:end
	4. To use the new downloader, perform the following steps.  The AMS will
	   display a "." for each record read successfully.  The letter "X"
	   will be displayed when an transmission error occurs.  But don't 
	   worry because the downloader will ask the VAX to retransmit the last 
	   record.  I also suggest that the terminal, NOT the VAX, be set on 
	   WRAPAROUND so that the "." will be printed on the next line instead
	   of being lost off the right side of the screen.  This is done by
	   entering setup mode A and changing the second bit of the third nibble
	   from 0 to a 1 and then type control S to save this setting.
		>DNL				type this on the AMS as usual
		$ DNL filename.xxx<ESC><ESC>	download filename.xxx
		....................		"." for each record read
		>				successful completion
	5. DOWND does not currently support symbol files.  This will change 
	   when the new LLF is released by Dave Shepperd.  To download symbols 
	   now it will be necessary to do a separate download using TEKHEX 
	   format in the following manner.  Note that the displayed data is 
	   the same as before except the leading "%" is not displayed.  This 
	   is how I can tell that the new downloader is present.
		>DNL				type this 
		$ TY filename.SYM		download just symbol file
		xxxxxxxxxxxxxx			data downloaded without the
		xxxxxxxxxxxxxx			 leading %
		>				successful completion


	If there are any problems report them to me at x1732 or via VAXMAIL at
CHARM::LOGG and I will try to correct them immediately.  If you have other 
ideas let me know so that I can try them out or document them here in this 
file.  For those of you that would like to improve on the download time even 
further.  The following can be done:
	1. To speed up communication to the VAX, have the Systems Group set the 
	   terminal to 8 bit NOPARITY.  It will also be necessary to change the
	   AMS too by typing "SET #12,0", "SET #22,0", and "SAV".  This will 
	   reduce downloading by approximately 1/11 (from 11 bits per character 
	   to 10 bits). 
	2. I have another version of the program that could download at 19.2K 
	   Baud but the download time is essentially the same as the download
	   time at 9600 Baud.  This leads me to believe that the 6809 excution 
	   speed is now the limiting factor in decreasing the download times.  
	   The current version of the program, at 9600 Baud, seems to send no 
	   XONs and XOFFs because it can fill memory as fast as the VAX sends 
	   data.  In any case, it would work for only those terminals named 
	   TXxx.  Do NOT have your terminal set to 19.2K Baud permanently 
	   because the AMS cannot currently handle that speed.  At 19.2K Baud,
	   I suspect the AMS is losing a character causing the download to 
	   hang.  So until the AMS software is upgraded I will not recommend 
	   this method.  
	   NOTE: the symbol files in TEKHEX format will abort on an error 
	   because there is no retransmission method for this file type.
	   NOTE: to temporarily use 19.2K Baud SET #20,#15 on the AMS and
	   SET TERM /SPEED=19200 on the VAX.  
	3. As a last resort, you can break the download data into several 
	   sections and load them separately.  This is only helpful if a small
	   number of these sections are being modified at any one time.


	The current performance of the new downloader is shown in the following
table.  Please note that your mileage may vary.  For your information, it takes
the VAX approximately 5 to 6 milliseconds to receive the ACK and start 
transmission of the next record.  For this reason, it is desirable to have the 
record size as large as possible.  There is a buffer in the AMS that holds 
the record sent by the VAX and I could not determine its size.  This means
I don't know how large a record it takes to blow up the AMS.  For now, it seems
to work fine with a record size of 250 and we cannot do much better with a
larger record size, so let's use that size until someone determines the real 
buffer size.
	TYPE TEKHEX.HEX		56.0 seconds with parity set at 9600 Baud
	TYPE TEKHEX.HEX		50.5 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=32	29.3 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=64	22.5 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=96	20.8 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=128	19.9 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=200	19.2 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=250	18.7 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=300	19.1 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=400	18.8 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=500	18.9 seconds with no parity at 9600 Baud
	DNL  TEKHEX.HEX/rec=infinte	17.1 seconds in theory at 9600 Baud

Subj:	Health Care


I disagree with the NWNL rep's decision to go with the health care
that costs the least.  I intend to make health care decisions for my
family based on getting the best possible outcome healthwise.  If
Atari helps cover the financial end through an insurance plan, that's
great.  If NWNL eventually goes full PPO (HMO) resulting in Atari's
insurance plans not covering the cost of any physicians I choose, well
that's OK, I'll still choose first and ask how much last.

Question: Is it the high cost of insurance (malpractise) that is
	  driving up the cost of insurance (health plans) ????

Another:  Who's more likely to be driving a Mercedes now:
	  a physician or an insurance executive ???

One more: Among yourself, a physician, and an insurance agent,
	  in whom do you trust first ??, second ??, last ??

Answers may be found under the rug.

Subj:	The DM on tuesday


Kim's system disk was corrupted sometime between last thursday and last night.
The corruption prevented it from booting, (don't ask me, I don't know where the
files went). Anyway, I had to restore the disk again from the last full backup
and apply the daily incrementals. This produces a side effect where the "new
mail count" in most people's account gets messed up. MAIL may say you have new
mail when you really don't or it'll NOT say you have new mail when you really
do. In either case you'll want to fix it. To do this enter MAIL and type
READ/NEW. Ignore the message about no new messages if you get it and exit mail
with an EXIT or control-z.

I'm in the market for one (preferably in time for Christmas).  I am
especially interested in trying to obtain a sit-down game, but will
settle for an upright if no one has a sit-down they wish to part with.
Send replies to this address.  Price is negotiable depending on the
state of the game (working, needs new monitor, etc.).

Subj:	LIGHTING SENSORS


After much deliberation, testing of the sensors and negotiating with
our contractor, an agreement has been made whereby all the ultrasonic
light sensors will be removed and replaced with passive infra-red
sensors.

The ultrasonic sensors installed in our buildings miserably failed to
meet the manufacuturer's spectifications and, consequently, were
disconnected.  The new sensors, a passive infra-red detector detects
infra-red heat waves generated by human beings with a filtered 9-10
micron/meter wave length sensor.

Our Applied Research Department was asked to put this new sensor
through any and all testing to ensure compliance with both the
manufacturer's and Atari's acceptance.  Two of these sensors were
installed in the administration area and found to be satisfactory
in operation as opposed to that of the ultrasonic sensors.  The
results of testing by Rick Moncrief's group revealed these sensors
to be 100% passive with no harmful effects.

Given the consternation caused by the previous sensors, anyone who
would like to inspect the sensor or sensor specifications, please
feel free to drop by my office and do the same.

We tentatively plan to install the new sensors on Tuesday, December
23, in the manufacturing building, and during the first part of
January in building 675.

I ask once again for your patience and cooperation.     Bob

We have instituted a few rules for using the company truck for business and
personal use. There is also a liability statement that has to be signed too.
Please cooperate with Cyndy in this matter. Thanks, Chris. 

1. Company needs have priority.
2. Personal use may be allowed, totally at the Comapny's discretion, provided:
	a) Sign-up with Cyndy ahead of time and fill out the liability statement
	b) 24-hour maximum use (48-hour on weekends)
	c) Truck is returned clean and tidy
	d) Truck is returned with gas the same as it was received.
3. KEYS:There is ONE set of keys. If the truck is in the parking lot, then
	Cyndy has the keys. No one is allowed to keep the keys even for 5
	minutes once they are back. If a user loses the keys, then he/she is
	responsible for their replacement. Cyndy has a spare set for this
	purpose and only this purpose.

			VAX-edrin Headache #1

     It happens everyday.  You go to delete a file, and the system gives you a 
discourteous message about not including the version number even though 
nothing else in DCL complains when you don't specify the version.  So you hit 
the up-arrow and tag a semicolon on to the end of the command and hit return.
So what's the big deal???  The big deal is I'M MAD AS HELL AND I AIN'T GONNA 
TAKE IT ANYMORE!

(more)...
     I have created a simple command file in my home directory called DEL.COM
which contains the following lines: 

	$ confirm = ""
	$ if p1 .nes. (p1 - "*" - "%") then confirm = "/confirm"
	$ delete 'confirm 'f$parse(p1)

In my LOGIN.COM startup file, I added the symbol definition:

	$ del :== @sys$login:del

     Now, I'm not bothered by the delete version error messages anymore, and I
automatically go to confirmation mode if I specified a wildcard file name.  If
I really want to blow away all the files covered by the wildcard, I just answer
"All" at the first prompt.

			VAX-edrin Headcahe #2

     I like the GOSUB/RETURN/GOBACK command set from Suttles, but I seem to 
constantly forget the enclosing square brackets in the GOSUB directory 
specification.  So what do you do to relieve the pain?  You go to Suttles and 
spend an hour with him to make it more to your liking.

     The GOSUB command now tries a list of reasonable things with the 
directory spec you send it.  So things like:

	$ GOSUB WHATZIT

will likely put you in the SYS$USERDISK:[WHERE_I_WAS_AT.WHATZIT] directory. The
command does not search the whole directory tree for a match, but it will look
near and far (sibling and offspring directories, and first level directories
off your home directory or on the same device).  Try it.  I think you'll like
it.

     And for those of you who have PC's, ST's, or other computers at home
where the default directory is declared with a CD command, there is a new
version of GOSUB called CD.  It's just like GOSUB, but if you just say CD with
no parameter, it does the RETURN function.  Install it with the following
symbol definition in your LOGIN.COM file: 

	$ CD :== @UTL$COM:CD

Enjoy.
