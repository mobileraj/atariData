VRAM Sockets
------------
The only known manufacturer of Production Sockets for 40 pin SOJ with 50 mil 
leads and 0.4" wide is:

	Yamaichi			Tel (408) 452-0797
	1420 Koll Circle		Fax (408) 452-0799
	San Jose, CA  95112		Rep is Irma

The preferred part is:		IC170-4040-200	 (Without Positioning Pin)
We could probably substitute:	IC170-4040-201	 (With Positioning Pin)

Alleged Reps: 	Erik's Electroncs	432-1111
		PSC			737-1333
		Low Down West		415-592-4900


MultiSync II
------------
We have received 26 boards plus one solder sample.

We are scheduled to deliver the boards to Fine Pitch on January 6 (Monday)
and receive them with the VRAMs attached on January 10 (Friday). Rob Bryant 
has set up the deal with Fine Pitch.

I don't know if we have received the parts needed to build them.

I don't know who is going to stuff them, or if Don Wrightnour will be
available to run them through Wave Solder.


Digital 'Scope
--------------
The proper method for choosing a DSO is to have several manufacturers bring
theirs in and give a hands-on demo.

We should buy only a new one. Buying a used one is asking for trouble.

This requires a bunch of time that I do not have.

Also, this should be done by the person who will be using it.


DS III
------
I will investigate the PMI DAC oscillation problem as time permits.

As it stands, DS III Sound Self Test is worthless because:
	1. Matt did not integrate his 2105 code with 2105 Self-Test code. 
	2. 68010 game code would have to be changed to work with it.

I would like the following:

	(2) Boards with TI  TMX48C121DZ-80

	(2) Boards with Micron MT 42C8127DJ-10

	(2) Boards with Sockets (If we can get them in time)

	(1) Board with Toshiba VRAMs (If we can get them in time)

	(18) Boards with Micron MT 42C8127DJ-80


1. Do not mix VRAMs from different manufacturers on the same board.

2. Do not mix VRAMs of different speeds on the same board.

3. All manufacturers should be used (currently Micron and TI; we are expecting
   Toshiba VRAMs soon).
   
4. If we can get sockets, make two boards with sockets.

Re: MultiSync II Stuffing Changes
Dt: 7 January 1992


A. On all 25 boards: Please put the DRAMs in sockets:

     (4)   179259-020	Socket, 20 pin, 0.3 wide	5K, 15K, 25K, 35K


B. On two boards only: 
	
	1. Use sockets for 200C and 210C (32k*8 SRAMs).

	2. Use sockets for 30S, 30U, and 30W (2k*8 SRAMs)

	3. Stuff the parts for the 12 Bit A/D:


C. On all other boards: Please mask the area of the board containing 
   30D, 60D, 15B, and associated circuitry so we can add the parts at a later 
   time (for the Training People):

D. I would like to see the first boards before they are Waved because the
   parts list might be wrong and I would like to catch the errors before
   they are Waved. 


These changes are for the 25 Rev 1 prototypes only. I do not expect this
circuits to be used in Production Boards. If they are, I will change the
parts list to reflect these changes.

MultiSync II
------------
Rob Bryant delivered 25 boards to Fine Pitch on January 6 (Monday). We
received 23 boards with the VRAMs attached on January 9 (Thursday). Two boards
were left blank and are waiting for VRAM sockets. Rob has the two blank 
boards.

Emmette is stuffing the boards and will run them through Wave Solder.

I have given Emmette instructions for making two special boards. They will
have the 12 Bit A/D stuffed and will have other selected parts in sockets.

ToDo:
	1. Do the GALs for the MultiSync II Board.
	2. Get AT Supply for my bench to power the MultiSync II Boards.
	3. Make the required changes to Self-Test.
	4. Test the Boards.


DS III
------
I will investigate the PMI DAC oscillation problem as time permits.

Thanks to a collective group effort we have made the change to the Sound
Boot ROM with Self-Test. (Rick, Terry, and Chip)

MultiSync II
------------
I have received three stuffed boards and have started on the board with
the TI VRAMs.

So far the board seems to work although it requires one Cut and two Jumpers.

I have changed the VRAM test done by the 34010 so it tests the additional
memory. It passes. And the pixels come out in the right order. I need
to change the picture of the board.

Stephanie wrote the VRAM test done by the 68010. I will need to have her
change it to handle the additional memory and to report errors for the
new memory configuration.

The new Color RAM has eight pages instead of four. It passes the test for
four.

The old MSP DRAM tests report ok. I have not changed them yet. I will need 
Stephanie for the 68010 tests.

The new program memory EPROM/RAM system seems to work. I will have to do
a new Table Driven Macro for Self-Test checksums.

The real test will be to bring up Race Drivin' on the board. I expect to 
deliver a board for this purpose next week.


Other
-----
The MultiSync IIs are configured to operate from an AT Power Supply. They may
not be plugged into the old power supply system unless the boards are
modified.

I drew up a simple circuit with green and red LEDs to test that the AT Supply
Connectors are wired correctly. If the connectors are correct, you get three
Greens. If any supply is reversed, you get Red. Dennis did a nice job building
it.


DS III
------
I have not had time to investigate the PMI DAC oscillation problem.

MultiSync II Self-Test Status
-----------------------------
The following have been checked:

1. 1M Byte VRAM Test done by 34010 GSP. The VRAMs appear to work and the 
   pixels come out on the screen in the right order.

2. 256K Byte DRAM Test done by 34010 MSP. The DRAMs appear to work.

3. Stephanie has modified the GSP VRAM Tests done by the 68010 and they seem 
   to work. She has also modified the MSP DRAM Tests done by the 68010 and
   they work, too.

4. 8 Bit A/D.

5. Expansion Bus: DS III Board
		  DSK Board
		  DSPLINK (at new address)

6. Timekeeper and ZeroPower RAM (at new address).

7. DUART (at new address).

8. OPTO Coupler Circuit.

9. GSP Scroll Register operation.

The VRAM Loop Test by the 34010 ran overnight and logged 295 tests with no 
failures.

Remaining to be tested:
	Color RAM
	12 Bit A/D
	Motor Interface
	Shifter Interface
	
The Yamaichi sockets have come in. Erik has removed the orientation pins and I
will give the parts to Rob Bryant.

Other
-----
I have received a letter from OrCad saying that the 12 month support we 
received when we bought OrCad PCB is about to expire. 

Normally they would want $295 to renew it for another 12 months. This would 
include an update to the PCB program when it came out. 

Because the release of PCB IV has been postponed they have decided to extend
technical support until 30 days after PCB IV is shipped, after which they
will want $295 to renew it. Sound fair to me.

[PCB IV was supposed to be released in January '91. It wasn't. There have been
lots of angry subscribers on the BBS accusing OrCad of using their PCB 
subscription money to fund OrCad's expansion into Sun workstations instead
of working on PCB IV.]

[Many have stated their intention of refusing to renew their subscriptions 
because the haven't gotten anything for it. Several have said that the reason 
they bought OrCad in the first place was because of advertisements last summer
promoting PCB IV.]

[Some have accused OrCad Management (which did a leveraged buyout last summer)
of abandoning the loyal customer base that made the company a success and
are predicting the company's eventual demise if they continue their course
of action.]

MultiSync II Self-Test Status
-----------------------------
I have tested everything I can think of testing so I have turned a board over 
to Stephanie, Terry, and Max who have brought the game up on it, first with
512K EPROMs and then with 1M EPROMs and SRAMs.

Things to do:

   1. New ROM Checksum table routines to handle mixing and matching EPROMs.
   2. Medium Speed Self-Test.
   3. Convert program to Microtek tools.
   4. Document things.
   5. Give Training a board.

There need to be four different sets of Self-Test ROMs:
	1. Standard Speed in 512K EPROMs.
	2. Standard Speed in 1M EPROMs.
	3. Medium Speed in 512K EPROMs.
	4. Medium Speed in 1M EPROMs.

Boards with Sockets
-------------------
We are still waiting for the board from Emmette.

Boards: MultiSync II Rev 1
--------------------------
The current disposition of boards is as follows:

	VRAM Mfg.	Speed
	---------	-----
#1	TI		-80	  Jed
#2	Toshiba		-100	  Chip		Standard Sync, 1M EPROM
#3	Micron		-8(S)	  Terry		Standard Sync, 1M EPROM
#4	Micron		-100	  Ray		Standard Sync, 1M EPROM
#5	Micron		-8(S)	  Max		Medium Sync, 1M EPROM

#T1	Micron		-8(S)	  Training	Standard Sync, 512K EPROM,
						with 12Bit A/D


The new ROM Checksum Table handles the mixing and matching of EPROMs and 
SRAMs.

Medium Speed Self-Test works.

I am still documenting things.

We have given Training a board, documentation, and two sets of EPROMs (27C512s
and 27C010s)



Boards with Sockets
-------------------
I have received the board from Emmette and will test it presently.

Boards: MultiSync II Rev 1
--------------------------
A. I have done a new block diagram for MultiSync II/DS III and given it
   to Dennis.

B. I propose the following procedure for approving VRAMs: 

	Run a game for at least 12 hours after which there should be no 
	errors on the Error Screen.

   I need to start doing this soon because I put all the 128Kx8 VRAMs on
   the AVL as 'Restricted'.

C. I talked to Thom Dempsey of TI. The TMS version of the 128Kx8 VRAM will not
   be out until April. 


Steel Talons
------------
Erik and I went to Production to investigate the report of a game with the
Rainbow Problem. (We brought Pete with us to introduce him to everybody
and to show him around.)

The game with the Rainbow Problem had Hitachi VRAMs in both Board Sets. 
It was theorized that these boards had come from Customer Service.

There was one other game with a problem that was traced to there being
one Hitachi VRAM on the board.

By the time we left, Jim Breshears had decided to unbox some or all of the
30 games ready to be shipped, to check for Hitachi VRAMs.

When we got back Erik realized that none of the boards he had seen had the 
mods.


Boards with Sockets
-------------------
I have received the board from Emmette and have started to test it.


DSPLINK
-------
It appears that Lipsons's new Drop code is not compatible with the 68010 code
he wrote for Steel Talons.

Re: VRAM Testing
Dt: 18 February 1992
CC: Rick


I need your help in qualifying the VRAMs in your MultiSync II. 

The final test is to run the board in attract mode for 12 hours with no 
errors. (This assumes the program runs with no errors.)

To do this test:
	1. Before you go home tonight put the game in attract mode.
	2. Enable WatchDog.
	3. Go to Self-Test, Operators Screen, Error Log. Zero the errors.
	4. Go back to the game.

	5. Go home.

	6. Come back the next day.
	7. Go to Self-Test, Operators Screen, Error Log. Record any errors.
	8. You are done.

This test must be done exactly as specified.

Thank you.

Boards: MultiSync II
--------------------
I have given Art the corrections to the Board and the Parts List and asked
him to have Rev 2 done.

I have finished converting the Diagnostics part of Self-Test for MultiSync II.


Boards with Sockets
-------------------
The board with the VRAM sockets was working until I unplugged a VRAM a couple
of times. That socket is now flakey. Erik will try to fix it.


ASIC65s
-------
I had Erik go through the pile of bad ASIC65s and neutralize them. We now have
137 safely bad parts.
 

Cox MultiSync II
----------------
If you want Self-Test for a Cox version of MultiSync II, I will need the 
following information:

   MultiSync II Board:
	Program EPROMs: How many; what type; and where loaded?
	Sloopstic: Yes or No?
	Are the 8B A/D and 12B A/D inputs the same as Panorama?
	
   DSK Board:
   	Are you using the Program EPROM?
	Are you using the Program RAM?
	Are you using the ZeroPower RAM?

   DS III Board:
   	Graphics EPROMs: How many; what type; and where?
   	Sound EPROMs: How many; what type; and where?

I will need access to a Sitdown Motor Amp and Steering Wheel to test the code.

MultiSync II VRAMs
------------------
I have asked Components to approve the two VRAMs that I have tested (with
Terry's and Chip's help):

	Micron MT42C8127DJ-8	(80ns)
	Toshiba TC528126BJ-10	(100ns)

I have a board with 100 ns Microns but they must be tested in a game.

The TI parts we have are TMX which there is no point in approving. TMS parts
are due out in April.

Erik fixed the board with the VRAM sockets. 



MultiSync II Flash EPROMs
-------------------------
TI Flash EPROMs are not available but Atmel makes some that appear to be
electrically compatible, although the programming procedure is different.
Their Flash EPROMs are only rated for 1,000 programming cycles.

Atmel also makes 1M EEPROMs that appear to be electrically compatible. They
claim to have parts that are rated for 100,000 programming cycles. 

I will pursue it if people are interested.



DS III Sound
------------
I believe I have reduced the oscillation problem to manageable proportions
by adding a bypass to each DAC reference.

  1. I need to hear what it sounds like with the real sound program.
  2. I need to know what your plans are for the board and whether to do a
     new rev. Yours plans for Play Sounds also affect this decision.

Re: Pirates
Dt: 26 February 1992


1. From the evidence, the Pirates have broken security on ASIC65. Guardians 
   has a problem because they use the same system. Consider the following:

   When Guardians comes out, the Pirates will obtain a board and be very 
   pleased to discover it is the same board as in Road Riot. The first thing
   they will do is plug in their counterfeit ICs to see if they work in the
   new game.

   We can do arrange it so that when they plug in their counterfeit ASIC65, it
   will work. For five minutes. After which it can do something like:
   	1. Give free credits.
	2. Give no credits.
	3. Make the game slower and slower. (Attract mode should be normal)

   They might not discover the problem right away. It might buy us some time.
   With any luck they might even burn OTPs.

   As an added wrinkle, we can make it so the M Jumper must be installed in 
   the new version. They will see the jumper on the board (that wasn't on Road
   Riot) and discover that their counterfeit part 'works' with the jumper
   removed. Hopefully, they will thereupon congratulate themselves for having 
   defeated us so easily and miss the real boobytrap. 


2. Street Driver. This is what we have so far:

   The Pirates seem to be able to break security on parts with EPROMs although
   we don't know how long it took them to do it. 

   They have broken security on the GAL which is EEPROM based. That is a real
   disappointment.

   So far they have not counterfeited a game with a motor. (The counterfeit
   Compact Hard Drivin' didn't even have a motor interface.) If we determine
   the absence of a motor we can crash the game.

   Gate Arrays slow them down (as long as the gate arrays are not from 
   Toshiba).

   Custom Cell Arrays would slow them down even more because they would have 
   to figure out all the layers.

   Full Custom might slow them down even more if the designer played process
   tricks. (It is also riskier for us.)
 
   Places in the Street Driver that could use a Gate Array or Standard Cell
   Array to perform an existing function and add a security function:

   	1. The circuit that reads the OptoCoupler;
	2. The Parallel Interface with Full Handshaking used in two places
	   (DS III Graphics and DS III Sound).

Security
--------
A. Classified

B. TI claims that their FPGA should be secure against being copied because:

   1. The physical size of an anti-fuse is on the order of 1.5 micron.

   2. The part is programmed from the inside out, which suppossedly means 
      that as the anti-fuses are formed, the inside fuses become inaccessible.
      This is even before the security bit is set.

   3. They say the part has a user signature (8 bytes) that can be read after
      the security bit is set but that the Data I/O cannot read it; their
      programmer can.

   4. Prices for TPC1010AFN-068C (1K) are $15.95 .

   5. The part takes about five minutes to program. If done in-house the
      overhead adds $5.83 to the cost of the part. 


   If we put it in a game we will find out if it can be ripped.

Re: TMS34020 SCLK and VCLK Timing


On page 71 of the TMS34020 data sheet:

						  TMS34020-32
 No.	Parameter				  Min	  Max	  Unit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 117   tc(SCK)  Period of video clock SCLK    	   35      50	  ns


 123   tc(VCK)  Period of video input clock VCLK   62.5   100     ns


Is this a misprint or what? This would mean that VCLK has to be between
10MHz and 16 MHz. [On the 34010, VCLK had a minimum period of 133ns which
corresponded to a maximum frequency of 7.5 MHz., but there was no maximum
period (minimum frequency)].

The SCLK parameters indicate a range of 20 MHz to 28.6 MHz . The system I am
designing will be 8 bits/pixel with a resolution of 512 x 384 with a Bit
Clock of 16MHz. Since each SCLK brings out 4 pixels, SCLK will be 4MHz. 
If the Parameters for VCLK and SCLK stand as shown on the data sheet I will
not be able to use the 34020.


Questions:

	1. Are the parameters for SCLK (117) correct as per the data sheet?


	2. Are the parameters for VCLK (123) correct as per the data sheet?

Motor Amp Board
---------------
I do not have the Film for the Rev 2 board so I have done two things:

   1. I have the original Gerber and Documentation files on a floppy.
      Getting a board made from these files would require a Plot of the
      Drill Template (which I have) and the Fab Drawing (which Erik would
      have to Plot on Mechanical's Plotter.)

   2. I called Davila Circuits which fabricated the board. Patty reports
      that they have the film and would be more than happy to make more boards
      for us. Just send them a Purchase Order for Atari Board 049304-01 Rev 2.
      Davila's number for the board is 32599.


Motomania
---------
I spent some time with Dennis Harper and Farrokh. They were having a terrible
problem with the Motor Amp. It seems that with the rear motor set to low 
speed, as they turned on the front motor, it would reach a point that would 
make the rear motor run at full speed without being commanded to.

This is what I found:
   1. The Motor Amp received its line power AFTER the Line Filter. The
      Line Filter is not rated for the zillion Amps that the motors require.
      The glitches were so bad it was causing the low voltage power supply on
      Motor Amp Board to drop out of regulation. Powering the Motor Amp 
      directly from the power line fixed most of the problem.

   2. The Filters connected to the motors introduce enough phase shift
      so that the pulse produced to command the motor to run at low speed
      (the pulse would therefore come at the end of the half-cycle) was
      spilling over to the beginning of the next half-cycle, which then
      became a full power pulse.

      The front motor requires so much current that it changes the phase
      relationship on the power line and therefore affects how the rear
      motor behaves.

The solution was:	
   1. Increase the minimum value that can be sent to control a motor. 

   2. If the value is less than the minimum, then send nothing to the 
      Motor Amp. The Motor Amp watchdogs in a frame or less (I do not 
      remember exactly) and prevents any pulse from being sent to its 
      respective Triac.

Also:
   1. The mechanical arrangement of the front motor is very poor. It
      is required to produce full power over 1/4 turn. This puts a
      real strain on the motor.

   2. I suggested to Farrokh and Dennis that they connect all the various
      parts of the game to a common source and measure the RMS current
      requirements.

Texas Instruments
-----------------
I am not happy with the support I have been getting from Texas Instruments.

1. I have been trying for at least a month to get data and pricing for the
   320C31 which is a cost reduced floating point DSP. Thom Dempsey turned me
   over to Rex and Rex turned me over to a Marshall Field Application 
   Engineer. I have attached a copy of the 'pricing' information that I have 
   received.

2. I had a question about the 34020 VCLK and SCLK signals. VCLK (which drives
   the 34020's sync counters) has a narrow range specified from 10 MHz to 
   16 MHz. Medium Speed will have a VCLK of 16.0 MHz and this range is 
   probably ok for the other speeds but it seemed so limited I thought there 
   was a misprint in the data sheet. The 34010 was rated at a VCLK period of 
   133 ns minimum (7.5 MHz maximum). There was no minimum frequency.

   	a. I called the GSP Hotline and received a recording instructing me
	   to fax my question to another number. I did.

	b. The answer I received was that it is not tested below 10 MHz in 
	   order to reduce testing costs. It would probably work down to
	   1 MHz but since it was not tested I would doing it at my own risk.

   Having to fax questions makes it impossible to have any kind of dialog.

   The reply I received has an 'attitude' that I really don't care for.

   They should have at least guaranteed VCLK for a 2:1 frequency range. The
   TMS34020 was clearly designed for the PC Market and they don't seem to care
   if anyone else uses it.
 
On Friday I told Thom Dempsey of my dissatisfaction with the Hotline response 
and that there were other things, too. He is scheduled to come in on Monday.
 
Shortly afterwards I received a call from Scott Huckaby (a marketing type at
713-274-2573) and someone else; I think it was Bob Milhaupt. 

I explained why I was unhappy and Scott basically repeated what was in the 
Milhaupt fax. He went on to explain that they would consider setting up a
special screening for parts to meet my spec. 

I told him flat out that I was not about to pay $20 for $0.03 worth of extra 
testing.

He said the reason for making the GSP Hotline Fax-only was to better serve
the customers since the TI people could ask the experts and not have to
give an answer cold on the phone. [This will be exposed as crap shortly.]

He started giving me a line about his not wanting to get into a pissing 
contest with me and there was no point in keeping Bob(?) on the line
if I didn't have any technical questions. So I read him the Riot Act.
									3 of 3

	I told him that I had used the 34010 in a very successful product
	that TI had been very happy to show to prospective customers to
	show what a 34010 could do. He was familiar with Hard Drivin'.

	During that time I had called the GSP Hotline several times and most
	of the time received an answer immediately. On a few occasions they
	had to find out the answer and call me back later. I considered
	my experience to be positive.

	When I have a question I want to talk to a human being. A Fax-only 
	Hotline is not interactive, and I don't like it.

	I don't like their attitude about testing or customer support and I 
	don't need the aggravation.
	
	If I design new hardware I don't seem to have much choice about the
	34020. It is the best graphics chip in town. (Actually, it may be
	the only graphics chip in town). But there are other people who make
	VRAMs and there are other people who make DSPs.

Texas Instruments 
-----------------
I met with Thom Dempsey on Monday and discussed my concerns with the 34020
(GSP) and the 320C31 (Floating Point DSP).

On Wednesday I received a call from Scott Huckaby to tell me that they were 
expanding the 34020s test range for VCLK from 10-16 MHz to 8-16 Mhz as I 
recommended.

I need to find out what VGA Sync is in order to determine if the SCLK
range will work as it is currently specified.

I have prices and a users manual for the 320C31. I received a call from Erik 
West who is a DSP Apps guy. I asked him mostly about development software.
The Assembler, Linker, C Compiler is $1500. The simulator is another $500 and
it supposedly works like Codeview. I can arrange a demo of the software if
people are interested.
 


MultiSync II Rev 2
------------------
I have received Plots and a parts List and they appear to be correct. In order
to release Rev A I need to know whether the DUART and/or the MSP should
be loaded.



GSP Evaluation Board 
---------------------
The purpose of this board is to allow Applied Research to try out some new
ideas for hardware. 

This board will connect to the MultiSync II Expansion Board so it will be
easier to design and build. It does not mean this is the final configuration.

There may be several GSP Evaluation Boards designed in order to try out
different ideas.

The first GSP Evaluation Board will probably have the following:
   (1) TMS34020
   (8) 256K x 4 VRAMs (1M Byte of VRAM)
   (2) DSP32C Floating Point DSPs.
	 Each one is attached to the 34020 Local Bus;
	 The DSP32C Serial Ports are connected to each other;
	 One DSP32C has four 1M SRAMs with ability to upgrade to 4M SRAMs;
	 The other is naked.
   (1) Standard PC Color Palette IC

Inputs to Art are scheduled for April 24.

Cox Self-Test
-------------
I am working on new Self-Test for Main Front Display to use DS III Graphics 
and Sound and for the MultiSync Side Displays to use DS III Graphics and
DSK Helpers.


Dallas Semiconductor
--------------------
I talked to Mike Alwais about their secure 8051 derivative. The DS2252(T) 
comes with RAM and a lithium battery. It is also available with a real-time
clock.

The Program is loaded unencrypted through a port; the part encrypts it
into memory. The part does random dummy fetches to confuse bus analyzers, 
and the part has a metallic-die layer that they claim prevents microprobing.

We would have to make a special programming station so the unencrypted code
is not in the game. 

Mike suggests developing code on an unencrypted part.

He is sending literature. The part does not use full DES encryption (it would 
be too slow) and therefore we should be able to export it with no problem.


Tektronix
---------
I talked to  Sharon Russel about digital oscilloscpes. She is sending
literature.

In four-channel 'scopes they have two model that look within range:
	TDS 420	  100 MHz sampling  $5995 + $340 for two more probes
	TDS 520   1 GHz sampling    $9490 + $350 for two more probes

       (Their four-channel 'scopes come with only two probes.)


Texas Instruments 
-----------------
I have asked for complete documentation for using the 34020 Emulation Port.
The reason is that everything (including Host Interface data) is on
the LAD (Local Address and Data) bus. If something on the bus shorts out, the 
Host Interface won't be able to talk to the 34020 to find out what is wrong. 

The Emulation Bus is separate and has only four lines. It is very slow but is
ok for rudimentary testing.
 
(In the 34010 the Host Interface is completely separate from its LAD Bus.)

It has been put on hold because of Training DSPLINK and Cox Self-Test.

Cox Self-Test
-------------
I have done Self-Test for the following:

	1. Side Display:   MultiSync
			   DS III Graphics
			   Fast Downloader

	2. Center Display: Main Board
			   DSK
			   DS III Graphics (no DS III Sound)
			   Fast Downloader

	3. Center Display: Main Board
			   DSK
			   DS III Graphics
			   DS III Sound (no Fast Downloader)

There wasn't room for both DS III Sound and the Fast Downloader so I did two
versions.

The programs cannot be considered complete until they are tested in the
actual unit.

Also, I haven't been told exactly what is being loaded.	   

Also, the ROMs I have seen have not been checksummed.

Also, there is a bug in the Fast Downloader code that Terry supplied me for
the Center Channel. Chip and Terry have decided not to fix it. I am very 
disappointed in them because of their lack of cooperation. Someone will 
probably need to work on the Cox code sometime in the future. By not fixing 
the Downloader now when it would be easy to do, they are making a lot for work
for someone in the future. They have already wasted the time I spent doing the
special version for them. I will not work on this code again and will delete 
the directory I created for them. I do not have space for useless programs.
 
Self-Test is a program; in the future the programmers should do it.

GSP Evaluation Board 
---------------------
It has been put on hold because of Training DSPLINK and Cox Self-Test.


DS III Board
------------
Software: 1. There is no Play Sounds in Self-Test because the software does 
	     not exist, either in the 68010 or the 2105.

	  2. Ray seems to be in charge of the 2105 Sound Boot ROM (which
	     contains Self-Test). Is this correct?

	  3. The way I am doing Graphics ROM Checksums is to have the 68010 
	     read the jumper that selects 512K or 1M EPROMs. The checksums are
	     compared to those from a table that also indicates whether the 
	     part is loaded or not.

	  4. The way I am doing Sound ROM Checksums is to have everything 
	     table driven. This means that Self-Test has to know which EPROMs 
	     are loaded, what size they are, where they are loaded, and what
	     their checksums should be.

	     The Sound software requires only that EPROMs be loaded in sockets
	     starting from a particular socket but does not require that they 
	     be in any particular order.

	     If you want Self-Test changed to adapt to this system the 
	     hardware must be changed so that:
	        a. It can read the ROM select size,
	        b. pullups are added to the Sound ROM data bus so that it
		   will not be confused by reading a floating bus.

	     In addition, some provision must be made so the software can
	     determine whether the EPROM is a 1M part or a 512K part in a 
	     1M address space.

	     Since I do not have access to the documentation of the header
	     table you will have to have one of your programmers program
	     and integrate these functions if you decide you want them.


Hardware: 1. The 12 Bit DACs each need a 0.1 uF capacitor. Are we going to 
	     do a new Rev of the board or just have them tacked on?

	  2. If we are doing a new Rev do I need to pull up the Sound ROM
	     data Bus.

VRAMS
-----
1. Micron: When I put the 128Kx8 VRAMs into the MultiSync II I told them I
   was concerned about using part that might not be supported. They said
   not to worry, that they would be producing them (MT42C127DJ) for a long 
   time.

   I was recently told that this part has become obsolete, and that they are
   now recommending the MT42C128DJ in its place. I have samples of them.

   Approving VRAMs takes a lot of effort. Most of the VRAMs were surface 
   mounted. I can't do that anymore because I can't get Karen to do boards
   for me. I have one board with VRAM sockets. We have already had problems 
   with these sockets and I don't know if they will work. 

   Testing VRAMs requires first, that they pass Self-Test, and second, that
   they run the game. I do not have a game, or access to a game. Your 
   programmers are busy working on Cox and Street Driver and I have not had 
   much success getting them to do things for me.

   The result is that the time I spent testing the parts that Micron has 
   discontinued has been wasted. What reason is there to believe that they 
   will not discontinue this new part in six months, probably in favor of
   the 2M VRAM they are pushing?


2. TI: TI promised that production parts of the 128Kx8 VRAM would be available
   in April. Mary's memo of 4/3/92 refers to samples available now. I don't
   have any samples of production parts.

Re: TMS34020 SCLK Timing



The board I am designing with the TMS34020 will be required to work with
several sync formats. One format is NTSC.

The Bit Clock will be 14.31818 MHz. (four times chroma) and the screen format
will be 700 x 480 (Interlaced) with eight bits/pixel. Each serial clock will
bring in four pixels.

I need to be able to use mid-line reload. Otherwise I will either have to 
waste memory or lose the capability of bulk memory clears.

How do I do this when the SCLK parameters indicate a range of 20.00 MHz to 
28.57 MHz ? 

Even assuming I use a custom (and more expensive and longer lead time)
oscillator of 14.31818 x 2 = 28.63 MHz I am outside your SCLK parameters.

(Even this assumes that DPYMSK can be configured to operate appropriately
with these paramters.)

You need to support NTSC if you ever want someone to use the 34020 in a
home video game. Or cable box.

 Jed

Re: TMS34020 Emulator Port

CC: Thomas Dempsey, Mary Burnias, Rick Moncrief


I am designing a board so that I can evaluate the performance of the 34020.

The board will have: one 34020; eight 256Kx4 VRAMs; one RAMDAC; and two
Floating Point DSPs. It will plug into an existing mother board.

To enable me to perform hardware diagnostics I want to have my host processor
talk to the 34020's Emulator Port. (This would be built into each game.)

I have been asking your representative Thomas Dempsey for this information for
several weeks but with no results.

I am out of time.

The design of this board must be finished by April 24 when it is scheduled
to be delivered to the PCB Group.

I must have full, complete, and clear documentation for the 34020's Emulation
Port by Tuesday afternoon, April 21, or I will be faced with three options:
   1. Do the board without an interface to the Emulation Port, thereby
      giving up the ability to do meaningful hardware diagnostics;
   2. Reschedule the board, thereby losing weeks or months depending upon when
      I can get another slot with the PCB Group;
   3. Cancel the board.

I do not consider any of these options very attractive.

I would appreciate any help you can give me in this matter.

Dallas Semiconductor
--------------------
I have information and prices. The one that we would want to use is the 
DS 2252T. This is a module that contains: 12MHz DS5002 processor (has a 8051 
core); 64K Bytes RAM (for program and data); Real Time Clock, and Lithium 
Battery. It comes in a 40 pin SIMM.

The price in 1K is $60.60 . This would enable us to replace: 
	2Kx8 ZeroPower RAM	$ 7.30	
	2Kx8 Timekeeper		$14.59
	ASIC65			$17.00
				------
				$38.89

It would therefore cost $21.71 more than we are already spending. Depending
how the 64K RAM was used, we could dedicate more than the 4K bytes of 
nonvolatile memory we are now getting from the Zeropower and Timekeeper RAMs.

Someone would have to figure out how to do development.


Tektronix

Texas Instruments 
-----------------
I faxed Scott Huckaby a question about how SCLK can be used in an NTSC
system with a clock of 14.31818 MHz when SCLK has a lower limit of 20 MHz.

I received a very nice reply saying that both SCLK and VCLK will be tested
down to 1 MHz.

Emboldened by my success I sent him another fax about how Thom Dempsey
hasn't given me the information I need on the 34020 Emulation Port and
that I am running out of time.

Scott called me to say that he had gotten the document in question 
declassified and would send it to me if I promised, in writing, not to ask
any questions about it. I figured that I didn't have anything to lose so I
did.

I also found out that there is an errata sheet for the 34020 that Dempsey
hadn't told me about. Scott faxed it to me. 
 
I have told Mary what I have been doing.

Before I can approve them they have to run in a game. We should do it

Texas Instruments 
-----------------
Monday I had a meeting with Tom Smith, Mary Burnias, and three guys from
TI: Thomas Dempsey; Philip Davis (Technical Sales Rep); and R. Gregory
Delagi (District Sales Manager, and their boss).

I had been told that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss ASIC65
failures. We did discuss it but not until later.

The new setup is that Mary gets Dempsey and I get Davis. I told them I didn't 
think it would work because Salesmen have all the power and Engineers have 
none. Delagi said they were going to give it a shot anyway.

I told them that in that day's mail was a promotional item from Texas 
Instruments for a seminar ($700 or so) all about JTAG and Design-For-
Test and that they had a lot of nerve, considering how they had handled
the 34020.

The general consensus seemed to be that since they couldn't do anything
about the 34020 emulation port (it is not JTAG) and they didn't want to
support it, I should just forgive and forget and get on with things.

I decided to take my best shot.

I told Delagi flat out that this had cost me a lot of time and that the
board I was doing didn't meet my standards for testability. If I go
ahead with the board I have no choice about the 34020; and Mary is free
to buy their VRAMs; but they could forget about DSPs. Based on their
support of the 34020 there is no way that I am going to subject myself
to even more aggravation by using their DSP. 

We then talked about the ASIC65. I was suspicious about entire tubes being
bad. Some were non-blank, some would not program correctly.

Tom Smith says the tubes were not opened in Receiving. TI says the ICs
left the factory 100% good. Davis wanted to know about the unit being used
to program them.

Davis wanted to send some samples back but I had to tell him "no" . I did
agree to bring him to the lab and show him the parts.

At the end of the meeting Tom Smith and Mary Burnias, who had both been
pretty quiet, went on the record to state that Atari Games had a very
good relationship with Texas Instruments and they didn't want it to change.

Smith then volunteered that most of the games on the schedule were from
McCarthy's group. 

That was the end of the meeting.
									2 of 2

I brought Dempsey and Davis to the lab and did a dump of six parts that were
received non-blank. A blank part should read all '1's. These all had the same 
bytes bad with the same data at the same addresses. I explained that if a
part is flagged as non-blank, my programmer stops right there and does not
try to program it.

Davis recorded the information and promised to look into it; maybe there was
a test vector that was inadvertantly left in the part.

On Tuesday I received a call from Davis. What we have in our parts are not
leftover test vectors. He really can't do anything without parts to analyze.

I suggested that he do the following: Have Thomas Dempsey talk to Rich Moore
and get his approval for me to give him four parts that were received
non-blank and four parts that did not program correctly. Since these last
ones have most of the real code intact, Dempsey is to promise Rich Moore
that these parts will not be read out; they will have the plastic removed
and the part erased; then they will try to program the part.

I recommend that all future ASIC65s be programmed on Programmers approved by 
TI, which limits it to either Manufacturing or McCarthy's Data I/O. I want to
get out of this loop.
  

Becky Depew
-----------
Becky did it again. She told me to sign something. When I asked a few simple
questions (like "what is it for?") she said it was something about a Canadian 
Patent but other than that she didn't know. She got angry and basically dared 
me to not sign it. So I didn't sign it.

We have tested the 80 ns parts in a game and they seem to work, although the

ADSP-2105
---------
I have sent the following mail message to the same distribution list that
Peter Lipson used when he defamed the 210X.

"Peter Lipson's VAX Mail "210X DSP serial failures" implies that there is a
newly discovered bug in the 2105.

I talked to Dan Ash and it appears the "bug" in question is really that a
glitch on the Serial Clock input that is shorter than the minimum serial
clock specified in the data sheet can cause the state machine that performs
the serial operations to get screwed up so that it needs to be reset.

The Party Line Bus used in Steel Talons and in the Police Trainer allow the
bus to float after one unit has released it and before another unit
takes it.

The work we did on the Police Trainer System showed that when the bus is
floating, the output of the Bus Receivers will be one or zero, depending
on its own input offsets. (The receivers are actually op-amps in disguise.)   

This led to a real problem on the Frame Sync signal, which we fixed by 
introducing just enough bias so that a floating bus would be pulled to the
correct inactive polarity. 

It appears that something like this should be done with the Serial Clock.

Note: 1. The way this is done on a terminated bus is different from the way
         it is done on a non-terminated bus.

      2. I have not seen the SPACE circuit. It may or may not be the same as
         in Steel Talons.

      3. The 'filter' Dan recommended is about 9 ns and may or may not help
         glitches caused by the switching between Bus Masters. "

MotoRama
--------
As a result of a meeting with various people alleged to be involved with the
project, it was discovered that the new higher current thyristors they were 
unable to get were, in fact, SCRs, and would not have worked. 

I have been in contact with Rich Comeau of Motorola. It seems that they
are in the process of making extensive changes to the fabs that make their 
thyristors and, basically, they can't deliver parts until October.

Rich Comeau checked all around and the ONLY Triacs he could find are
MAC223A10s from Future Electronic in Boston. They have 4,000 parts.
(The MAC223A10 is 25 Amps and 800 Volts.) Note, there are no MAC15A6s to be
had.

According to MANMAN we have 141 MAC223A8s in inventory (132004-001). They are
rated for 25 Amps and 800 Volts and were used in the Rump Thump Board.

SGS-Thompson also makes Triacs and someone could check with them if they
wanted to.


The MotoRama Motor Amp, Continued:
---------------------------------
 
At 60 Hz a half cycle is 8.33 ms. 

The counter that determines the conduction angle has a maximum length of 
8.19 ms.

At 50 Hz a half cycle is 10 ms. 

Therefore, what would be a low-power cycle at 60 Hz will be 2 ms 
(out of 10 ms) at 50 Hz.

If this needs to be fixed in hardware there are three options:

	1. Change the 1 MHz oscillator oscillator to 830 KHz.

		Not a standard frequency.

	2. Change the Divide Ratio from 64 to 78	[Board Change]

		Requires changing LS393 to GAL16V8.

	3. Change Divide Ratio to 128.			[One Cut, One Jumper]

		Reduces Programmable range from 128 to 78.

Re: Status Report, Tektronix Digital Oscilloscope
Dt: 19 May 1992


The two digital 'scopes from Tektronix that look promising are the TDS460 and
TDS540. Both have four channels.

Erik and I met with the Tektronix rep (Michael J. Martin) on Thursday. We 
spent some time discussing specs and then Michael J. demonstrated the TDS540.

The information I got from him (and from the rep in Oregon) did not always
agree with the catalogs or brochures. I have since been in contact with Dave 
Nelson in Oregon (800-835-9433, X4357) and have received what I believe are
satisfactory answers.

I recommend the TDS540 because:
	It is available with RS232 and Centronics Interfaces;

	The software will produce TIF and PCX files;

	The TDS540 has the ability to trigger on a logical combination (AND, 
        OR, NAND, NOR) of the four input channels. 

	It has a higher maximum sampling rate.

The TDS460 would require a GPIB Bus interface before it could be used with
a printer. Also, someone would have to write software to convert one of its 
data formats to TIF or PCX. Even if this were done, it still would lack the 
540's ability to trigger on a logical combination of the four input channels. 
------------------------------
Specifications:

PROBES	Both now come with four probes.

GUI	Both have a Graphical User Interface that is supposed to make it 
	easier to use. It comes with online help.
 
SAMPLING
        TDS460:	100 MS/s on each channel.
	TDS540: 1 GS/s 1 channel
		500 MS/s 2 channels
		250 MS/s 4 channels

	The sampling rate on the 460 is, indeed, 100 MS/S. The way it works
	on single events is as follows: 
	
	There are 512 points on the screen.

	At 0.5 us/division you will see 5 us of the waveform on the screen.
	(That must mean that there are 10 divisions on the screen). If you 
	have the extended memory (for a total of 30,000 points) you will be 
	able to	store 30,000/512 * 5 us = 293 us for a single event.
 
	If you select 1.0 us/division you will get 10 us of the waveform
	on the screen but since there are still only 512 points on the
	screen the theory is that it will digitize at 50 MS/s.

	The 540 presumably operates in like fashion. 
								2 of 2

VIDEO	The TDS540 has a 7" Raster Scan CRT with a display of 640 x 480. It
	may be VGA but is not specified. It has no video output jack.

	The TDS460 has a video output at VGA speeds but is monochrome.

PRINTER PORT

	The TMS540 can dump the screen to a printer (or other device) in 
	several formats, including PostScript, PCX, and TIF. PCX is the
	format used in various PC Paint programs; TIF is used by the
	Macintosh. This means that waveforms can be sent to a file to
	be directly integrated into Andrea's manuals. GPIB is standard
	with RS232 and Centronics available.

	The TMS460 does not currently support TIF and PCX although it
	does support PostScript. It is not currently available with RS232
	and/or Centronics ports. GPIB is standard.

	(Tektronix made a glaring omission by not allowing the user to add a 
	label to the display.)


TRIGGERING:
	The TDS540 has the ability to trigger on a logical combination (AND, 
        OR, NAND, NOR) of the four input channels.

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
I am checking the plots.

I am getting Don Wrightnour to check the surface mount devices.



Micron
------
The 128Kx8 VRAMs (100 ns) have been added to the AVL.



Tektronix Digital Oscilloscope
------------------------------
The two digital 'scopes from Tektronix that look promising are the TDS460 and
TDS540. Both have four channels.

Erik and I met with the Tektronix rep (Michael J. Martin) on Thursday.

We spent some time discussing specs and then Michael J. demonstrated the 
TDS540.

The information I got from him (and from the rep in Oregon) did not always
agree with the catalogs or brochures. I have since been in contact with Dave 
Nelson in Oregon (800-835-9433, X4357) and have received what I believe are
satisfactory answers.


Specifications:

PROBES	Both now come with four probes.

GUI	Both have a Graphical User Interface that is supposed to make it 
	easier to use. It comes with online help.
 
SAMPLING
        TDS460:	100 MS/s on each channel.
	TDS540: 1 GS/s 1 channel
		500 MS/s 2 channels
		250 MS/s 4 channels

	The sampling rate on the 460 is, indeed, 100 MS/S. The way it works
	on single events is as follows: 
	
	There are 512 points on the screen.

	At 0.5 us/division you will see 5 us of the waveform on the screen.
	(That must mean that there are 10 divisions on the screen). If you 
	have the extended memory (for a total of 30,000 points) you will be 
	able to	store 30,000/512 * 5 us = 293 us for a single event.
 
	If you select 1.0 us/division you will get 10 us of the waveform
	on the screen but since there are still only 512 points on the
	screen the theory is that it will digitize at 50 MS/s.

	The 540 presumably operates in like fashion.


VIDEO	The TDS540 has a 7" Raster Scan CRT with a display of 640 x 480. It
	may be VGA but is not specified. It has no video output jack.

	The TDS460 has a video output at VGA speeds but is monochrome.


PRINTER PORT

	The TMS540 can dump the screen to a printer (or other device) in 
	several formats, including PostScript, PCX, and TIF. PCX is the
	format used in various PC Paint programs; TIF is used by the
	Macintosh. This means that waveforms can be sent to a file to
	be directly integrated into Andrea's manuals. GPIB is standard
	with RS232 and Centronics available.

	The TMS460 does not currently support TIF and PCX although it
	does support PostScript. It is not currently available with RS232
	and/or Centronics ports. GPIB is standard.

	(Tektronix made a glaring omission by not allowing the user to add a 
	label to the display.)


TRIGGERING:
	The TDS540 has the ability to trigger on a logical combination (AND, 
        OR, NAND, NOR) of the four input channels. 

	There have been times when I have had to add circuitry to a board
	in order to create the trigger point that I needed.

	(The TDS460 has no such capability.)

Re: Status Report
Dt: 22 May 1992


This is not my usual Status Report.

This company is in trouble. Big Trouble.

We've been in trouble before, like when Ruport Murdock tried to take over
WCI. It totally distracted Warner's management, and when WCI paid huge 
amounts of Greenmail to fend him off, it drained the Company of the cash 
needed to operate. Both of these things led to the demise of Atari, Inc.
(From a conversation with James Morgan, Atari Inc.'s last president.)

We've been in trouble for a long time, taking on Nintendo, a company ten times
our size, in the legal arena, distracting the current management and draining 
the Company of cash that could be more profitably spent in other areas. Does
anyone remember the big beautiful piece of land at Tasman and Vista Montana
that was to be Atari's new home? Does anyone remember when we were not livivg 
in each other's armpits?

We've been in trouble for a long time, trying to compete with companies that
consider their Coin-Op business an excellent way to develop and pre-sell games
for the Consumer market. They sell their coin-op games at little or no
margin, giving them a greater chance at the magic #1 and #2 spots on the 
Equipment Polls.

Yes, we've been in trouble before, but not like this.

Some Programmers want really cheap hardware because they don't feel they
are capable of creating a game that is good enough to justify more expensive
hardware.

Some Programmers create games specifically with an eye toward its eventual
translation to the home market, thereby producing "dumbed-down" coin-op
games. (But they make great kits.)

Programmers in the Game Groups don't get the Engineering support they feel
they are entitled to. Imagine wanting to actually have an Engineer assigned
full time to their game? (Or even half-time?)

Some Engineers, faced with trying to support more games than they possibly
have the resources to support, want to design the Be-All and End-All Hardware
that contains everything any Programmer could ever possibly want (in a $100
Hardware).

Everybody is mad at the Audio Group because the teams don't get the sounds 
and music they want for their games. The games all end up sounding alike,
anyway, due in part to the rather limited nature of the Sound Hardware, which,
unfortunately, is the only hardware the Audio Group is willing to support.

Everybody is mad at Marketing, which comes by every few months and demands
major changes to the game based the five minutes they have played it.

Marketing is mad at everybody because no one will do what they tell them to
do.	
									2 of 2

Mechanical Engineering seems to have learned its craft from watching 
"MacGyver".

Manufacturing is mad at Engineering because Engineering isn't supplying enough
product to keep Manufacturing going. Also, Engineering keeps wanting to use
new parts, instead of using up the old parts, of which we tend to have alot 
because Sales doesn't seem to be able to sell many games.

Engineering is mad at Manufacturing because Manufacturing won't stock even
commodity parts beyond which is needed for the next build. And when people
find out what the new Overhead rate is, they will (or should be) Furious.

Everybody is (or should be) mad at Sales and Marketing for not selling more
games.

Well, Now We Have The Solution. 

Let's contract everything out. We are already contracting out hardware
and game development.

By contracting out the hardware, Engineering Management finally has the
control it wants over costs, technology, and schedule. Of course, the
hardware may need a few finishing touches for Testability and Manufacture-
ability, but the Engineers will be happy to finish someone else's hardware, 
put it into production, and thereby contribute to this someone else's 
royalties. This has the added advantage that licensed product is not eligible
for Bonus.

By contracting out the game development, and making Marketing the main
contact, Marketing can finally enforce their decisions on game play. (Do It 
My Way If You Want To Get Paid.) Perhaps they can do for game play what they 
did for Side Panel Graphics.

I don't think we should stop there.

Let's contract out Sound and Music so that the team (which is now Marketing) 
will get what it wants. Dittos for I.D., Mechanical, Harness, PCB, 
Publications, and Animation. Did I leave anyone out?

Let's contract out Manufacturing to eliminate overhead (and unused Production 
Capacity). Or, we could deal with unused Production Capacity by having
Manufacturing become a Contract Manufacturer for other companies. (Outside
contracts always have priority over internal product, so internal product
will have to be contracted out, anyway.)

Finally, after having completed the total disintegration of the Company, we 
can contract out Management.

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
Went out for Boards.
Filled out a Purchase Req for the 34020, VRAMs, RAMDAC, and fast 1M SRAMs.
Gave Karen the Parts List and asked her to get the other parts. 

I have converted the character set and will convert as much software as I can 
while I am waiting for boards.


DSK Rev B
---------
Gave Inputs to Art.


Tektronix 'Scope
----------------
Michal J. brought in a TDS460. It does not change my recommendation of
the TDS540.


Micron
------
I have tested and approved the 100 ns parts. In order to test the 80 ns parts
Erik has removed the sockets and asked Karen to attach the parts directly.


The MotoRama Motor Amp, Continued:
---------------------------------
I have received no replies to my memos about 50 Hz operation. I will therefore
assume they will compensate for it in software. Somehow.

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
I am still working on software conversion.

The boards came on Friday and I have given five to Karen.

The VRAMs came on Thursday but Dave Pasquinelli decided to sit on them
until someone came looking for them.


DSK Rev B
---------
I have gotten a part number for the 128Kx8 SRAMs.

The hardware that is necessary to run the old SciCards software has died
and apparently can't be fixed (like I predicted would happen).

Art was supposed to receive the conversion program but neither of us expects
it to work.

Art wants to make an exact copy of the DSK board on the new system (like they
did on the Motor Amp board).

I have had experience with old SciCards hardware and software not working
so I told him ok.


Micron
------
The 80 ns parts have been soldered to the board. It looks good except it
does not consistently pass the memory tests.

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
The boards came back from Fine Pitch. I have asked Karen to have some done 
by Tuesday.

I have come up with a method of interfacing the GSP Evaluation Board with a 
MultiSync Board. It involves using a GAL to create an additional 2M Bytes of 
address space on the Expansion Bus that will accept the DTACK signal from the 
34020. Existing peripherals will work with no mods.

I am still working on 34020 test software.


DSK Rev B
---------
Art promised me an exact copy of the DSK board with the new system. The plots
I received were not an exact copy.

Since I have to treat this as a new board I have redesigned parts of it that
I was unhappy with and have also done the following:
	1. Removed Slapstic and its associated pair of ROMs;
	2. Increased the RAM from two 32Kx8s to two 128Kx8s.

I have redone the GAL to relocate most of it to the lower 1M of the Expansion
Bus address space.

I am less than thrilled at having to do a board over again. Yes, I know it
can't be helped. There is just no end to this.

Texas Instruments
-----------------
Phil Davis, the TI guy they gave me so I wouldn't bother Thom Dempsey, came to
see me without an appointment.

When I went out to the lobbly he explained that he had actually come to see
someone else and thought he might as well see me, too. (That me me feel
really special.)

I asked him if the 128Kx8 VRAMs had been production released yet. He said
he didn't know anything about it but he would look into it and get back to
me.

I asked him if they had evaluated the dead P15s yet. He said they hadn't
been able to work things out with Rich Moore because of his recent trip out
of the country.

I explained to him that we had been using the P15 for security and no longer
had a use for it since it had been ripped. He expressed surprised because
he seemed to think it was such a terrific part that we were using it to
run the game. 

I wanted to see how much he actually knew about the part so I mentioned
that it was difficult to interace anything to it because the address bus does 
not go tristate except during Reset; unfortunately the internal Data RAM is 
dynamic and does not get refreshed during Reset. I had, of course, developed
several very successful techniques for interfacing to it.

He said he didn't know anything about it but would look into it and get back
to me. 

I informed him that I hadn't asked him a question, that instead, I had told
him something.

This guy doesn't know anything and he doesn't listen. He is an idiot.

I received the following memo from Rob Bryant:

From:	MIKE::BRYANT       15-JUN-1992 11:15:23.64
To:	MARGOLIN
CC:	
Subj:	

      Hello, Jed.  If the "Trainer" team wants me to build up 27
   prototype Multisync II boards, might you know if there are any
   128Kx8 VRAMS 120ns around anywhere?  Or perhaps 256Kx4 DRAMS?
   I'd be looking for 216 VRAMs and 108 DRAMs (8 per and 4 per).
   If there aren't any over in your building I'll ask Mary B to
   get some.  Thank you for any input you can give.

					Rob

This was my reply:

Rob, there are some things you should know:

   1. The parts list you seem to be building the boards from appears to
      be a preliminary version for Street Driver.

   2. I informed the Training group several months ago that they need to
      come up with their own parts list. Apparently they have not done so.
      This will lead to several people doing a bunch of otherwise
      unnecessary work.

   3. As far as I know, the Training group is not using the MSP. If this is
      true you do not need the following:

      MSP Parts:
	(1) 	137502-001 	74F244		
	(1)	137547-001	AS573		
	(2)	137440-001	ALS245		
	(4)	137694-120	256Kx4 DRAM	
	(1)	137538-002	34010-50	
	(1)	144008-005	50 MHz Osc	

      Notice that the 256Kx4 DRAMs are among the unneeded parts.
					
   4. I believe they are using the 12 Bit A/D which is not used by Street
      Driver. The 12 Bit A/D and associated parts are not on the Street
      Driver parts list.

   5. Note: VRAMs are specified as 120 ns with alternates of 100 ns and 
            80 ns.

	    DRAMs are specified as 120 ns with an alternate of 100 ns.

   6. The MultiSync II with sockets has failed and I have no way to test
      VRAMs other than to build boards, which isn't going to happen.
      (There was only one of the two boards with sockets built because
      Chris Downend decided that Karen had more important things to do.)
									4 of 4
      There are currently two approved VRAMs:
		Toshiba: TC528126BJ-10
		Micron:	 MT42C8128DJ-10

      The boards we have already built used mostly Micron MT42C8127DJs which
      have been discontinued and TI TMX48C121DZs. The TMX means it is a
      Pre-Prod part which I will not approve. The Production parts (TMS)
      were supposed to be out last April; they weren't. Then they were 
      supposed to be out in June. Phil, the TI guy, doesn't know anything 
      about it (or anything else for that matter).

      When you buy VRAMs please try to get some Micron MT42C8128DJ-8
      and some TI TMS48C121DZ-10 and -80 if they are available. No TMX
      parts, please.
      
  7. This word just handed to me: ManMan reports there are 4000 VRAMs in
     inventory. 

     137693-100  IC,VRAM,128KX8,100NS,CMOS,40P SOJ

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
On Monday I received a MultiSync board modified to be used with the GSP
Evaluation Board. It uses a GAL to create an additional 2M Bytes of address 
space on the Expansion Bus that will accept the DTACK signal from the 
34020. Existing peripherals will work with no mods.

On Tuesday I received GSP Evaluation Boards ready to be tested. So far:

  I have tested most of the GALs used for addressing and they operate as 
  designed;

  I can flash the LEDs, including the one on the GSP local bus;

  VRAM Refresh works;

  The board produces Video Sync;

  I have found the cause of the stuck data bit;

I hope to have video on the screen soon.


DSK II and DSK II Dev
---------------------
The plots for DSK II appear to be ok, but the board has been put on hold to 
do the DSK II Development board with the DSP32C PGA version so it can be used 
with the ICE.

I have approved the plots for the DSK II Dev Board and we should have film
and fab by now.

How many boards to order?

I suggest we buy a DSP32C PGA (WE-DSP32C-R33-100) for each board. Otherwise
the ICEs will end up sans DSP32Cs. (Note, the PQFPs are F33 and the PGA is 
R33.)

Re: Status Report

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
It produces sync and I am able to put video on the screen through the 34020 
host interface.

It passes the VRAM test through the host interface.

It runs some of the 34010 memory test code but not all of it. I believe the
VRAMs are working; if they aren't we will need a digital 'scope and a
logic analyzer to fix it.

The DSP32Cs seem to work although I can't get the memory tests to properly 
work through the 34020 host interface. I believe the DSP32Cs are working.
if they aren't we will need a digital 'scope and a logic analyzer to fix it.

I had a problem getting the AT&T RAMDAC to work properly. The Brooktree
didn't work, either. The problem was solved by a Brooktree applications
engineer who asked if I had initialized the Pixel Read Mask Register.
(I hadn't.)

As a result of this problem I have discovered that the the Brooktree 478 and
AT&T 478 are not the same. The AT&T part has a internal reference, while the
Brooktree part does not. I will change the circuit to use the Brooktree part. 
I believe it will then be able to use either.

I believe the board is now working and ready to be programmed.

I have three working boards (two of which need minor mods) and one board
that needs all the mods.

I have one MultiSync that has been modified and tested with a GSP board,
one MultiSync II that has been modified and tested with a GSP Board, and
another MultiSync II that has been modified and is still being tested.

Dennis has done a very nice job in getting the GSP Boards built and the 
MultiSync IIs modified.

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
It is now running all the memory tests. The problem turned out to be that
while, in a system with no host the 34030 stuffs the low 4 bits of the
Interrupt Vector into the CONFIG register (to set up the memory 
configuration), it isn't supposed to do it when you DO have a host.

Well, it does it anyway.

I have fixed the white line on the left side of the screen.

I still haven't gotten the DSP32C memory tests to work although I believe the 
DSP32Cs are working.

Phil Davis from TI is going to try to get us an emulator on loan for next 
week.


Other
-----
I talked to Brian Smith from Intel and suggested they do an IC for use with 
the i860 that would be used with VRAMs. It would have:

   1. Address multiplexing for the VRAMs;
   2. VRAM Refresh;
   3. Display Refresh;
   4. Sync Generator;
   5. A secondary cache that knows about VRAM page mode and block writes.

These things should all be programmable.

These are all things that the 34020 does. Unfortunately the 34020 does not
have a FPU and TI seems to have dropped plans to produce a 34020 with a
34082 FPU built-in.

Without a secondary cache (or even a buffer) that knows about VRAM page mode 
and block writes the i860 is a crippled machine.

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
I have turned it over to Max and Stephanie. Max has gotten stuff on the
screen.
 
We have received the loan of an emulator for the 34020. It doesn't work.



GSP Evaluation Board Test Software
----------------------------------
The GSP Evaluation Board test software comes in two versions:

   1. It runs on a MultiSync Board at $2 0000 and lives on the VAX in 
      [MARGOLIN.GSPE]

   2. It runs on a MultiSync II Board at $4 0000 and lives on the VAX in 
      [MARGOLIN.GSPEMS2]


There are two things to note:

   1. The Emulator memory must be mapped for the program being run.

   2. The GSP Evaluation Test Program is considered an Application Program
      by Self-Test; it is run by taking the system out of Self-Test.


DSK II
------
I hereby pronounce it working. 

I have turned one over to Terry and he has brought the game up on it. 

I have updated MultiSync II Self-Test to use this board. [MARGOLIN.MS2]

The current version is ms2_103.vlda for slow standard speed (512 x 288) and 
ms2_103M.vlda for medium speed (512 x 384).

Re: My Resignation
Dt: 24 August 1992
CC: Sandra Brown


This is to inform you of my resignation from Atari Games, effective
15 September 1992.

 1. I would like to continue my medical insurance (including dental) as 
    provided under COBRA.
 
 2. I would like a lump sum distribution of my 401K money as soon as possible,
    in any event not to exceed 30 days from my termination date.

If there are forms that I need to fill out in order do these things, then I
would like these forms this week so I can study them before filling them out.


The highlights of my contribution to the company are as follows:

						 		 Gross Sales
Games:								(Approximate)
								-------------
	BattleZone (graphics algorithms 			  
		    and hardware sounds) 			  $62,500,000

	Star Wars (project engineer and				  
		   graphics algorithms)			  	  $45,000,000 

	Hard Drivin'/Race Drivin'/Stun Runner/
	Panorama/Steel Talons (project engineer,
	self-test, instant replay, and integer 
	3D graphics algorithms)			  		  $70,000,000
								 ------------
								 $177,500,000


Other: Rick Moncrief and I performed RFI field studies in California, Oregon, 
       and Nevada in 1980 and, with communications attorney Jamie Cook, wrote
       the proposal that pursuaded the Federal Communications Commisssion to
       reclassify Coin-Operated Games from Class B to the less restrictive
       Class A, thereby saving the company millions of dollars that would have
       otherwise been required to meet Class B standards. The other companies 
       in the coin-op business have similarly benefitted from this work.

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
I have identified what is causing the problems that Max reported and I am
working on a fix.


Other

When people leave Atari the tendency is for their VAX files to become lost
when their accounts are deactivated.

If you don't want this to happen to my files (which contain all the Self-Test
code) I suggest that you have someone with a PC and Network Card download all
my files and then back them up on Tape. They can then be deleted from the
PC if desired.

I have created a listing that shows what was used where. [margolin]dirs.doc

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
1. The new mods appear to fix the problems that Max reported.

2. I have fixed the 68010 routines that test the DSP32C memory. 

   The DSP32C External Memory Simple Test takes 5 minutes. 

3. I am working on a memory test that lives in the DSP32C. By the time the 
   DSP32C C Compiler got through with my C program it was too to fit in the 
   Internal Memory. The Assembly code it produced was also really ugly. I
   will continue to work on it.

Re: TMS320C30 Emulation Port


Can you provide documentation for the TMS320C30 Emulation Port? I am

considering using it during Self Test.

Re: My Last Status Report

GSP Evaluation Board
--------------------
   The program runs with the new mods so I pronounce the board finished.
   I have fixed the 68010 routines that test the DSP32C memory. 

   The DSP32C External Memory Simple Test takes 5 minutes. I did not have time
   to get the software done so the DSP32C can test its own external memory.

Files
-----
[margolin]dirs.doc is a listing of what is where in my VAX files.

On my PC I have created a file called pcdirs.doc on drive E: that
lists PC files relevent to the Self-Test programs I have done.

The files in drive E: contain the source code for 2101/2105 and 34010 test 
routines as well as the OrCad schematics for the GSP Evaluation Board.

I put them on drive E: so they would all be in one place; they also exist 
on drive D: .


MIDI
----
I came across the mods we did to make the TomCat DUART into a MIDI Port.
I have done a schematic showing how this can be accomplished on Main/
MultiSync/MultiSync II Boards.


Texas Instruments
-----------------
In the course of trying to get documentation on the 34020 Emulation Port from
Thom Dempsey and his idiot boss Greg Delagi, they said that the 34020's 
Emulation Port was different from the ones used in their DSPs.
 
When we got the '34020' Emulator it became obvious that they had lied.

On Tuesday I called the DSP Hotline and asked for documentation for the 320C30
Emulation Port, expecting them to say no.

On Thursday I received voice mail informing me that I would be sent the
"Emulation Porting Guide" and "Fundamentals of MPSD" (whatever that is).

I am really curious about whether this is the Real Stuff. Unfortunatey, it 
will arrive too late for me.
