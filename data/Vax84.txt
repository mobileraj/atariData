Subj:	A neat trick with mail


	For all of you who use the MAIL program as a form of
the "paperless office", I have discovered a bug (pronounced
"fea-ture") in same.

	It seems that the addressee line (TO: ...) is parsed
independently of file handling.  Mail looks at each item in
the list, and checks for a double colon (which specifies node
names).  Then it does a logical translation of the node name,
if any, and goes back to the "we expect a name here" part of the
algorithm.  The upshot of this is that you can have MORE than
one node name on any addressee; this does not apply to list names
(in the "@soandso" construct, the soandso must be a legal filename).

	What good it this, you ask?  Well, the normal useful value
is zip.  Presumably it would just take the mail longer to be sent,
cuz it would be routed through a longer path.  HOWEVER, if you don't
give it a normal name, you can use this feature (pronounced "BUG")
in an abnormal way.

	If you:		$ assign " " cc		! for mail
then you can send mail	To:	him, her, them, CC::me, mine
and any of the parties involved can have a nodename.  The CC::
must have a double colon following it, and can have a nodename
following that, for example, "cc::kim::suttles" is valid.
The assign statement in the first line of this paragraph is
required, either interactively or in your login.com (like I
have in mine).  The space between the quotes is required,
cuz there must be some length to a logical name.

	The "value" is that you can show some intent in how
(and maybe why) you are sending the letter to that person.
You could just as easily create a logical name FYI or any
other(s) along the same lines.  They can be used as often
or rarely as you like (to: FYI::him, FYI::her, CC::me, etc.).

	There is one more thing to consider.  This is NOT a
documented feature.  It may not stick around in future versions
of VMS.  Then again, it may.  I have tested it, and it works
as I have described (did I mention you can add them?  like:
to: him, FYI::CC::ERNIE::you, etc)  under the system we are
now using.

	I am not going to stick CC in the system tables, since
CC is also a command for compiling C programs (there is no
conflict, but people MAY want to use CC as a logical name to
point to their C sources, or to other things).  FYI and the
other possibilities will also not be in the system tables,
since I don't know in advance which ones will be used and which
won't, and I am also sure that you will come up with some of
your own.  Also, if DEC changes their mind and it goes away,
I can say "I told you so!!".  Actually, the real reason I
am not going to stick any of that stuff in the system tables,
is cuz I'm lazy.  But don't tell Shepperd.

Subj:	Sound Chips


	By popular demand, here is a list of sound chips which are or will
be available for use in coin-op games:

1. Pokey and Quad-Pokey

	Price: $1.35 for Pokey, $5 for Quad-Pokey, estimated.

	Performance?: $0.47 for Pokey, $1.59 for Quad-Pokey.  Seriously,
		2-4 channels per pokey, depending on whether 8-bit
		(sound effects) or 16-bit (music) frequency resolution is
		selected.  Square waves and various types of poly-counter
		noise.

	Availability: Now.

	Support: A sound editor exists for the 800, and RPM includes a
		pokey driver.

2. Yamaha sound chip

	Price: $15.70 for the sound chip along with a custom DAC, $2.50 less
		without the DAC, in 10k quantities.

	Performance!: 32 time-slots (sine wave oscillators) which can be
		patched together in various ways, to give 16 voices of
		frequency modulation, or 8 voices with 2 modulators and
		2 carriers each, etc.  Modulators can modulate other
		modulators, etc., very flexible.  Built-in attack-decay
		sustain-release envelopes for each oscillator.  It is
		basically the same chip which is used in Yamaha's DX-7
		synthesizers, except 10 bit output instead of 12.  Each
		voice can be directed to left channel, right channel, or
		both (center.) Excellent for music and sound effects, 
		even capable of doing speech with the right preprocessing,
		although not efficiently in terms of memory storage.  Creating
		interesting sounds is easy, creating the interesting sound
		you wanted is a little more difficult.  FM is somewhat
		non-intuitive (although there are rough guidelines), and it is
		difficult to computer analyze a sound and derive the FM
		parameters (though this may be do-able).  However, with
		good support tools (which exist) and instant feedback of 
		changes in sound parameters, it shouldn't be a big problem. 

	Availability: The legal agreements are being worked out now, there
		don't seem to be any problems on either side.  I will notify
		people when the deal is finalized.

	Support: Yamaha will apparently supply one of their new Yamaha Personal
		Computers along with documentation and software to support
		the sound chip, which will be available in Japan as an
		add-on.  The Personal Computer is apparently aimed at the
		low end (under $300) market, uses the new MSX (if I have the
		right acronym) software standard that the Japanese have all
		agreed on, and runs Microsoft Basic (in English, no less).
		The sound development software seems on first inspection
		to be very professional.   The development software will 
		probably include some already designed musical instrument 
		voices (and a few sound effects.)  I view this chip as filling 
		in a gap between the obsolescence of Pokey and the availability
		of Amy, after which time we may wish to use Yamaha, Amy, or
		both, depending on the game.  If I were designing a game for 
		production in 6-9 months I would definately include this chip 
		(as soon as the deal is signed.)  We will need for someone 
		(volunteers???) to write a Yamaha driver for RPM.

3) Amy

	Price: around $8.

	Performance!: Additive synthesis, 64 harmonics, which can be divided up 
		in various ways among 8 channels.  Built-in amplitude and 
		frequency envelopes.  Choice of sine or noise for the 
		harmonics.  16-bit output, you can choose how many bits you 
		want to use for your DAC.  Easy to analyze a sound and derive
		the additive synthesis parameters to resynthesize it.  Can
		do high quality speech and singing, though not efficiently.  
		A slight memory and processor bandwidth hog, but very powerful
		and flexible.

	Availability: Estimated 1st silicon in June, production quantities in
		December.  As soon as we have 1st silicon, I will begin
		recommending for people to design Amy into their games.

	Support: The sound group at Corporate R&D is designing a development
		system for Amy.  An Amy simulator is available now and will
		be moving over here before long.  Some sound analysis and
		editing software has been written.  The Amy development system
		will be much more powerful than that for the Yamaha, although
		currently it is aimed more at creating music voices than at
		sound effects (the same is true of the Yamaha support tools.)
		Amy will also need a driver to be written for RPM. 

4.)  TMS 320, TI's digital signal processing chip.

	Price!: $26.50, 2nd half of 84, in 25k quantities.

	Performance: It's a great little chip, if you only need to do what
		it is optimized to do - straight digital signal processing,
		sum-of-products, etc.  It has the advantage of allowing
		you to use different synthesis techniques to create different
		sounds.  In practice, once all the overhead code gets added
		in, it is very difficult to get a reasonable number of
		channels (8) at a reasonable sample rate (18 khz.)  I have
		programmed it with a couple of different sound algorithms -
		1) 8 voices with an excitation function of either noise,
		triangle wave, sawtooth wave, and a stored bandlimited 
		function, followed by either one or two 2nd order bandpass
		filters.  This allows filtered noise (with independent 
		control of center frequency and bandwidth), sine waves from
		ringing a high-Q filter, and formant effects from filtering
		the periodic excitation functions. Algorithm 2) is a strange
		technique using a 2 dimensional waveform table, a surface
		which you can move around on in various patterns (lissajous
		patterns, etc.), tracing out the height of the surface at
		each point.  I recently received the D-A board for the 320,
		and should have my programs modified so I can hear the sounds
		within a week or two.  Assuming the Yamaha deal goes through,
		the 320 will be dropped as it is more expensive, harder to
		interface, less powerful, and has no sound development tools.
		Its only use might be in implementing some kind of fancy
		adaptive predictive coding technique for cramming mass
		quantities of sampled sound onto rom or videodisk.  And it
		has much potential for doing vector graphics computation.

	Availability: Now.

	Support: I have an evaluation board, with on-board assembler,
		debugger, emulator, and RS-232 port.  There are various
		macro cross-assemblers available for VAX, from TI and
		3rd parties.  TI is apparently putting a greater than
		average effort into supporting this chip.  I also have
		an analog interface board with A/D and D/A.

5.) TI 5220 speech chip

	Price: $5.50.

	Performance: 1 voice of voice.  Some sound effects can be done as
		well - the elephant trumpeting pass-by on Star Wars.  The
		sound quality is a little unnatural but preserves some
		of the speaker's identity and expression.  Reverb, noise,
		and background sounds on the source tape can totally
		confuse the PASS analyzer.

	Availability: Now.

	Support: TI PASS system analyzes the speech and allows the user to
		edit it, frame by frame.  The system typically makes a 
		number of pitch errors, amplitude errors, and filter parameter
		errors, which have to be cleaned up by hand.  It's a fairly
		slow process, and requires some intuitive feel for linguistics
		and why we perceive certain phonemes the way we do, etc.
		There is a 5220 driver for RPM.

6.) Other stuff.

		Brad Fuller has some (partially debugged) code using a 6502
		to implement one channel of adaptive delta modulation.  This
		could use 1 channel of a pokey as a DAC (forced output mode)
		(4 bit - scratchy sound quality), or a real DAC.  Not sure
		if the 6502 would have time to run RPM too, ask Brad.  Could
		be used for storing voice and some sound effects, higher
		sound quality than the TI speech chip (assuming a reasonable
		sample rate), but higher storage requirements - ~15,000 bits
		(not bytes) per second for 6502 adaptive delta, ~1500 bits
		per second for TI speech chip.

		We need some way of A) getting a number (8 or more) of 
		alternate voice (&sound&music) tracks off of a section of 
		video disk, so we can use the same video for a number of
		different purposes, and B) getting a long passage of sound
		(10 seconds or so) off of a still frame of video.  A) might
		be done by downloading adaptive delta modulation parameters
		to a ram and feeding them to a 6502.  8 channels * 
		15000 bits/sec*channel * sec/60	frames * byte/8 bits => 
		250 bytes/frame.  Can we grab this much or more off a
		video disk?  B) might be done with TI speech chip.  Anyone
		have any ideas or interest in helping with this?  (Dave
		Storie is also interested in this problem.)

		I welcome comments, suggestions, and offers to write the
		Yamaha driver for RPM!

Subj:	Sound Chips update


	Regarding my previous memo, Morgan Hoff informs me that the quad-
pokey is actually a $12.90 part.  Performance is still under $2.00.

	Also, the 320 signal processor's cost increases due to the need
for high-speed rom and ram and interfacing hardware, depending on the
specific application.

Subj:	Webster, A dictionary program

     There is now available a spelling checker program. This program takes an
English text file and outputs the file with all the misspelled words and
their line numbers at the end.
     There are over 47000 words in the dictionary. This is a lot but not
enough to guarantee that your favorite words are in there. So, When you
find correctly spelled words marked as not in the dictionary please send
them to me and I will update the dictionary.
     To use this program put the following command in your login.com file:

      $	WEB*STER :== $DOC:WEBSTR 'P1

     Typing WEBSTER file.ext will run the program and process the mentioned
file. The default input extension is .MEM. Webster will create a file of the
same name with the extension .CRF

     Please forward any problems and comments to me. I will update the
dictionary every couple of weeks. If your favorite words do not show up
after you send them to me please be patient.

Subj:	Webster, Contractions or possessives


     It has come to my attention that contractions (can't, didn't, etc) don't
work in the webster program. The Dictionary has these words and the program
will recognize them if I define the apostrophe (') as an alphabetic character.
I have done this and contractions now work. There is, however, a price for
this feature. The dictionary does not have all of the possible possessive
forms of words. Since the program is able to recognize the word "didn't",
it will not find the word "witch's" in the dictionary. I use contractions
more then I use possessives. If there is a problem with this I would like
to hear about it.

From:	KIM::MAHAR          27-JAN-1984 14:19  
To:	@SYS$MAIL:ENGINEER
Subj:	Webster, How about this?


Webster can now handle almost all cases of contractions and possessives.
If it can't find a word in the dictionary it scans the word and
truncates the word at any apostrophe that may be there. For example:
"witch's" will become "witch". The dictionary is consulted again with the
new word. This leave the only problem being a misspelling like
"can'tj". the 'tj is removed and the word "can" is in the dictionary.
So, no mention will be made of the word in the listing. If you don't like
this feature I will set it back to not handling possessives at all.

Subj:	Announcing the new utility MIXIT


At long last, the utility we've all been waiting for: MIXIT. Available the
next time you log in or restart, it allows you to convert image, .ROM, .EXE
or .LDA files into image, .ROM, .EXE, .LDA or .MAC files at the flick of a
keystroke. This program answers the ever increasing demand for "how do I put
my banked switched program into a 27128?" and the old continuing problem of
"how do I get a listing of my .LDA (or .PPS) file for the legal beagles?"

The program reads one or more input files and writes a single output file. You
specify what MIXIT should include from the input file and where to position the
data in the output file. Each input file is processed seperately and inserted
into the output file as it is read in. This results in the data from the input
file being appended to (or overlayed on) the output file, so some amount of
care should be exercised if you plan to be tricky and have sections of data
overlap each other. 

There's four basic commands to MIXIT: HELP, EXIT, OUTPUT, INPUT. The OUTPUT
command specifies the filename of the output file and must appear before any
INPUT commands. Each occurance of an OUTPUT command starts a new output
sequence. The INPUT command specifies the filename of an input file and the
data from each is deposited into the previously defined output file.

Type MIXIT and use the HELP command to get further information.

There's only one error message, and its rather self-explanatory.

	Happy mixing,
	ds

Subj:	Webster, The great debate


I guess I was unclear. Webster will only strip after the apostrophe if
the word is not found in the dictionary. Words like can't and didn't
will be found in the dictionary so they will not be flaged as wrong.
     The only inaccuracy is the "can'tj" case mentioned earlier as the
word "can'tj" is not in the dictionary.
     I am reviewing contraction and possessive recognition techniques
and all of the suggestions I have received have some flaw in them. Therefore,
I am regrouping and will release a new version over the weekend.

Subj:	Webster, Contractions and possessives the final word.


     This is the final word on contractions vs. possessives. Webster
first looks up a word in the dictionary. This includes any apostrophes
that may be in the word. Most of the common contractions are listed
in the dictionary and will be found this way. If the word is not in
the dictionary Webster checks do see if the word ends in S'. If it
does, the ' is removed and a dictionary lookup is done on the root word.
If the root is not found in the dictionary the original word with the
apostrophe is added to the misspelled list. If the word ends in 'S
the 'S is removed and a spelling check is done on the root word. Once
again if the root is not in the dictionary the whole word is placed in
the misspelled list.
     This system will catch almost all cases of contractions and
possessives. There is one exception, however. A singular word ending
in S is, by the rules of usage, made into a possessive by adding 'S.
So, the possessive of abacus is abacus's. If you have this correct
in your text Webster will not complain. However, A common mistake for
this case is to treat the word as if it was plural. ( abacus') This
is incorrect but Webster will not flag it as so.
     This is not a major problem. I have found only a very few nouns
that end in S. It is difficult to say words like abacus's so people 
usually put these words in a prepositional phrase ( of the abacus).
The ackwardness of these words has caused most of them to fall into
disuse. Spending 10 minutes looking in the dictionary only uncovered
a few. ( abacus, lotus, mass, and marquis) I sure there are more but
not many.

Subj:	The first annual Jeff Boscole Memorial letter


This letter is dedicated to Jeff Boscole, someone who wasn't afraid
of sounding obscure, to speak his mind, to be strange, to be brilliant, 
to play games, and to use MAIL to its fullest.  I don't remember when
he left,  but it was quite a few months ago.

   To anyone who cares, but especially to game designers with more clout than
FXL,  and to any and all people in power at Atari (not just coin-op):

   Recently I have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to instigate
improvements in royalties, designer credits, and game testing procedures.  I
have had little success. I hereby apologize for all of the negative feelings
and anger that I am emanating because of this.  After all, things are pretty
good here, and certainly better than at many companies.  I do not however
apologize or regret my negative feelings about the recent release of the
Crystal Castles 2600 Cartridge.  (In case you don't know, the cartridge was
released without the approval of the coin-op design team, or anybody else
in coin-op as far as I know).

  This is pure theft!

And I do not even know who to blame for this!!  It isn't the programmer, who is
about as mad (or worse) as I am about this situation.  He was given a unmakable
release deadline (4 days instead of 3 weeks from when he was told). The game is
much worse because of this (according to the programmer Peter Niday).  He had
no choice in the matter.  Yet another unfinished, hurried, poorly tested game
from Atari.  Won't we ever learn? 

Games under license from other companies get reviewed by representatives of
that company (Williams and Namco specifically).  But games developed in-house
are treated like they are in the public domain, while the original design team
of in-house games is treated like dirt.

  This is not an isolated incident either.  Atarisoft, as a matter of policy,
takes Atari Coin-op games, lets outside companies "convert" them for home
computers (like Commodore 64, Vic-20, Apple 2, TI-99 and IBM-PC), and then
produces them, all without the creative input or advice of the original design
teams (just talk to Ed Logg about Centipede, or ? about Battlezone).  Atarisoft
does not ask anyone over here at coin-op for approval for the final version,
but they do show the final version of the game to someone in the legal
department. On the more positive side,  there is a chance that Atarisoft will
contribute to the Engineering Product Bonus Plan in a manner similar to 2600,
5200 and 800 products.  Wouldn't it be nice to have that guaranteed and in
writing?  And shouldn't there be designer credits on Atarisoft products?

    It's ironic that my name is on the packaging of the 2600 Crystal Castles
cart, a product which I only saw an early version of.  Yet when I told people
that the message ("programmed by Franz Lanzinger") appeared in level 10 in the
coin-op version  I was told to take it out, or I loose an amount of bonus to be
determined.   Boy did that make me mad !!! I complained vocally, but only to be
promised that a designer credit policy would be worked on. This policy is still
"being worked on" eight months later.  Now really. It's not that hard to do,
just look at movies, books, not to mention Stern, Mylstar, Simutrek, Sente,
even 2600 carts.  If there were a policy right now, credits could be in in time
for the Crystal Castles kits. As it is, I am still mad about the whole thing.
Imagine Speven Spielberg directing a film, but not getting credit.  How would
he feel?  Are we cogs in a machine?  I am not a number !!!  This isn't 1984!!
(well OK, maybe it is).

   While I'm at it I would like to get one more thing off my chest (right
on!!). You may know that the current "coin-op engineering product bonus plan"
(shouldn't it really be called a royalty plan ?) is out of date. The most
recent legally binding document (if it is legally binding) is dated March 26,
1982,  and it expired at the end of 1983.  It is my understanding by reading
that memo that the bonus plan is still in effect, but it can now be " extended,
enhanced, discontinued or otherwise modified to meet management objectives ".
In other words,  Atari has the legal right to screw us any time they want.
Personally, I would feel much more secure, happy, and motivated to work hard,
if there were an updated royalty plan without a gaping loophole like that.
After all, there are plenty of precedents for people getting screwed here.

   I am tired of fighting a brick wall.  So I will resign myself to the facts
of life at Atari.  These facts seem to be that change is virtually impossible
when suggested by a single empoyee, but mindbogglingly fast if management wants
it.  And I will continue to feel bitter now and then (like right now for
instance).

    How do you feel about all this?  How do you feel about 40% 30% 30% (the
"golden handcuffs")? How do you feel about 1% under 10M, 2% over 10M?  How do
you feel about designer credits?  How do you feel about the delays in actual
payment of royalties? (I still don't have a cent for Crystal Castles, and it
has been seven months since it started to earn millions for Atari).

    What can you, anyone who cares, do to make me, Joe Piscopo (oops, make that
Franz Lanzinger) feel less bitter?  Well, misery loves company. Please tell me,
better yet, tell your favorite manager, supervisor, or even CEO, how you feel
about these issues. It may not change a thing, but maybe your powers of
persuasion will succeed where mine failed.

    Until next year, (when I will write the second annual Jeff Boscole memorial
letter)
			FXL
			(the X stands for "eX trouble maker")

P.S.  please send your answers to @SYS$MAIL:JUNK, or to someone in a position
to take action, best would be both.

P.P.S.  If there are any inaccuracies, please let me know.  The facts are to
the best of my recollection, some of it is hearsay.

Subj:	Yamaha Sound Chip


I now have 3 samples of the Yamaha 2151 FM synthesis sound chip (see my
Jan. 19 '84 mail message for details.)  Also 3 samples of their 3012 D/A
converter.  Also documentation for each of these chips (46 pages of hand-
written Japanese English, but basically pretty understandable.)  The
documentation is in the process of being typed up, but if anyone wants
to check out a copy of the handwritten version, see me.  This is available
for coin-op evaluation only; they don't want us competing with their home
computer.

We should have one of the Yamaha PC's within a couple of weeks, hopefully,
and a demo will be given.

Subj:	Another flame

    Another Jeff Boscole Memorial letter, in response to FXL's letter on
Jan 30, 1984.

    I was unaware of any policies regarding 2600, Home computer, or any other
computer system, nor was I told of any.  All I was told about was a bonus
plan if the game I worked on was turned into a cartridge.  This DOES tend to 
say that the creating team will have no say in the cartridge.  I, for one, 
would like to have some say in the final version of the game, since I feel 
very strongly about my game.  

    Since I haven't been impressed by the results of VCS's releases, I DON'T
want them to butcher, maim or mutilate my game for whatever reason.  I
can fully sympathize with Franz, since he put a lot of time and effort into
his game.  By the time my game goes into production (knock on wood), I will
have put at least a year of my life into that game.  I don't want someone
to come along, and rip me off.  I don't really care about royalties from the
other games, I just don't want to have to apologize to anyone about a 
game that has my name in it, on it, or associated with it.

    Also, since I haven't heard anything from management about the bonus plan
lately, I can only assume that Franz's research is correct.  Since I happen
to have a Team Leader that I feel I can trust, I'm not too worried about
getting screwed on the bonus.  That doesn't mean that there shouldn't be
something in writing.  Something my mother taught me - 

	"If you really mean what you what you are saying, 
    then you won't mind putting it in writing."


    While I'm still flaming, I feel that it WOULD be nice to have my name
appear in my game somewhere.  It would really be nice to be allowed to
do this, since Star Wars had the names of the people appear on every odd
wave going into the death star.  It seems a little inconsistant to me that
the Star Wars project could have their names, and Crystal Castles couldn't.
For some reason, that appears to be favoritism, not policy.


    Return flames gladly accepted.

    Peter Thompson.


P.S.  If anyone can show me a good game for the 2600 that we produced, I
will fully apologize, and then go out and buy it.

Subj:	More on FXL letter (or the second biweekly Jeff Boscole letter)


Since everyone else seems to be on the subject I might as well add my two 
bits worth.

First, regarding testing and review of 2600, 5200, 800,... software.  In
the past I was given carts to review, and in some cases they ignored my
comments.  In particular, for the 800 Centipede I saw a bootleg copy and
send my comments back only get see the shit hit the fan because I managed
to see the cart which should not have been possible.  Months later I was
officially given a newer version to test.  I noted some problems and asked
that the game play match the Coin-Op version in several aspects.  I was
told that it was too late because they couldn't make the changes in time 
for the release.  More recently I attended a meeting to decide which
Millipede cart for the 2600 should be released.  The release date was less
than a week away and I was told that the programmer had just gotten one
version working within the last couple of weeks (and only possible thru
7 day work weeks and considerable lack of sleep).  I should also point
out that I sent the complete documentation of Millipede to the team leader
responsible for the VCS cart months prior to this meeting.  I also called
and left my name and number with the comment that I was available for
any assistance.  I received no response until a week or two prior to the
above mentioned meeting.  This leds me to believe that the game was not 
ready for help until the time of the meeting (thus verifying the hearsay
that the game had just been developed in the last two weeks).

Now for the good news!  ATARI did select the VCS version of Millipede over
the version done by GCC.  I was told that GCC was instructed NOT to do this
cart but they went ahead and did it anyway.  I guess they felt that if they
got it done first ATARI marketing would use theirs.  Judging from the 
meeting I attended, I would guess that they were right.  In any case I have
worked with the VCS programmer since and hopefully the cart has improved.
I do NOT mean to say that I necessarily helped but that the cart just needed
time.  I should point out that the cart was not released due to a bug!  Now
why didn't we think of this before?  That sounds like a good strategy to 
follow.  The only reason I was given why the cart was to be released within
a week of the meeting was to have ONE week worth of sales for the first
quarter.  WHAT A SHITTY, GOD DAMNED, FUCKING CSDKFHAS FHLAVFHJ EXCUSE!!!!
What ever happened to quality which the name ATARI is supposed to represent?
Where was VCS management??  I would hope that someone would stand up and
say "THE GAME IS NOT READY.  WE WILL RELEASE IT WHEN IT IS DONE!!"  Who 
are they trying to make look good?  Why impress Warner with 1 weeks worth
of production, when you can impress the consumer 2 weeks later?  It seems
short-sighted to make themselves look good at the expense of ATARI's
reputation.  

Well enough of that, I want to get back on the subject of good news.  Months 
ago I also reviewed a Millipede for the 800 (or 5200 I don't remember).  I 
sent my comments back and just last week received a letter back for Richard 
Frick thanking me and giving me a list of changes they have implemented.
When I talked to him he recalled when the comments came back and how the
programmer grumbled about doing any more changes.  However after the
changes were made the programmer has become very excited about the new
program.  Now ISN'T that a heart warming story.  It sure made my week.
I hope we see more cooperation like that in the future.

Second, as Franz hinted I never received a copy of Centipede to review from
ATARISOFT nor was I even told about any Centipede carts.  Ignoring the
fact that is rather insulting, it is not in the best interests of ATARI.
We should demand quality from any product ATARI puts its name on. 
Considering there is expertise here in Coin-Op to test and evaluate this
product, they should be very interested in hearing from us.  Since there
were no designer credits, I guess it was hard for them to dtermine who
to come to but they could have found out.

Since there seems to be new policies regarding credits for our games and
since there seems to be a lack of trust between certain individuals and
management, couldn't we have some WRITTEN information of these policies.  
In particular, can someone reassure us that the current bonus program is 
still in effect and will remain so until xxxxx.  Can the current policy on 
credits be written down and include if possible the current policy on credits 
with respect to 2600, 5200, 800, and ATARISOFT conversions.  For everyones 
information I was not told that my name would appear on the 2600 Millipede
documentation.  I had to ask Steve Calfee.  In fact it seems logical that 
the names  of all members of the Coin-Op team responsible for developing 
the game should appear.  Can someone write down whether the ASTARISOFT 
software will bring royalties to Coin-OP?

Now for my pet pieve, can we get a little better accounting on
the bonus program?  I was given verbal assurance by John Farrand that this
was possible but maybe he doesn't understand how hard or time consumming
this is.  In the past ATARI didn't want to do this because this would 
release information that the competition is not supposed to know.  In fact
if you want to know the VCS sales of a cart, just call your friends at
Activision or Imagic or Starpath for the info.  I was also told that the
other divisions just paid monies to Coin-Op but did not supply the number
of units sold or other info.  With the new organization I would hope that
this information would be available.  The kind of information I would like 
to see with our bonus checks is 1) Coin-Op units sold (at full price) 2) those
sold at a loss (thus no royalties for them) 3) Coin-Op kits sold (as
above) 4) same for 2600, 800, 5200 and ATARISOFT.


					Ed Logg

P.S. They (Marketing) released the 2600 Millipede on Monday before they
	could test the cart for the required 40 hrs.  There was a screen
	roll failure after 35 hrs.  So by the book they should not have 
	passed the cart for release.

Subj:	Complaints

To: Unhappy People
From: John Ray
Subject: Complaints			Date: 1/31/84

I would like to let you all know what the current status is with the
complaints that have recently been voiced.  I see the complaints
falling into the following subjects: 

1. Consumer conversion of Coin-Op originals without Coin-Op inputs. 
2. Designer credits in the Coin-Op product. 
3. Bonus issues. 

MY VIEWS 

1. I agree that we need to have a great deal more involvement in
consumer conversions of our products.  I talked to Steve about this
when he gave me the Crystal Castles Cartrige one working day before
it was to be released.  He agrees.  I'm sure that it will be much
more convenient to interact with the Consumer Programmers when they
are in our building.  I'm sure that the Consumer management and
programmers will be happy to hear any input you have on one of your
games.  For the long term, I will work with Steve to formalize the
procedure of giving feedback so that we do not repeat past mistakes. 

2. When the Consumer designer credits policy was announced, I was
given the task of coming up with a policy for Coin-Op.  I did this
over Christmas and submitted my proposal to the Team Managers right
after the holidays.  I incorporated some of their suggestions and
submitted the proposal to Dan Van and Steve Calfee on 1/11/84.  Dan
has submitted my proposal to Skip Paul and John Farrand, but with all
the recent organizational changes there may be a longer delay than
normal.  Please have a little more patience. 

3. There are many bonus issues, most of which I have not discussed
with Dan Van.  He IS looking into getting rid of the "Golden
Handcuffs" (40/30/30) and getting an "advance" on royalties. I will
discuss with Dan the other issues that have been brought up as well
as going over the mail messages received on this topic. 

I think bringing these issues out into the open is healthy, but I
don't want you to feel like you have to have a revolt to get me or
Dan to listen to you.  Dan always personally answers any written
messages you send to him.  I always answer questions to the best of
my ability, and take questions to Dan that I cannot answer.  I was
already addressing the issues that Franz has brought to my attention.
The problem is that these types of things take longer than you would
expect.  You may think that it is absurd how long things take, but
remember that designing a game also always takes longer than anyone
expects. 

One last comment, courtesy of Chris Downened:  "Junk" goes to lots of
people who do not participate in the Product Bonus Plan at all. They
may not appreciate hearing about our concerns regarding this plan. It
might be better to use "@sys$mail:engineer.uaf" or a similar
restricted audience. 

Thanks!!
John

from: Chris Downend
Subject: Response to Boscole Memorial Letter

First of all, rest assured the issues you mention ARE being 
worked on - they are constant topics at meetings I attend.
Everybody seems to be involved in making decisions these 
days. This ensures all viewpoints are heard but with a horrible 
speed penalty.
 
The solution is to keep plugging away and enlist support as 
you have! By the way Franz, you are certinly a valued 
employee with clout - one thing Atari undeniably 
values is people that can produce successful products and 
you have certainly done that with Crystal Castles.

I have unique perspective on the situation since I 
have programmed games at the "bottom" and at the 
same time I have seen the decision-making process
at the "top" - I can empathize with both sides.

One word of caution though, I note that you suggest dialogue
thru VAX and the "Junk" heading which routes the text to 
everybody on the VAX including employees who do not 
share in the Product Bonus (royalty) and they just 
might not appreciate hearing about our lofty concerns
about credits and amounts of bonus since they 
get neither. May I suggest the @sys$mail:engineer.uaf heading or a 
similar restricted audience. Management must be sensitive to 
the feelings and desires of many diverse groups inside 
Engineering and this complicates and lengthens the decision-making 
process. A snap decision to address the issue bothering 
one party may upset another party - management has to 
consider the whole picture sometimes.

On Royalities: Yep, Atari can screw us anytime they want.  
I do not think they would for fear of a lot of people 
leaving.  The Company has to protect itself.  Please realize 
that thru much of 1983, Atari paid bonuses 
even though Coin-op was not making money - we 
were operating in the RED and still paying bonuses !  Now thats
commitment. Of course that cannot go on for too long or else the 
whole Company goes down. That's the reason Atari has escape 
valves built in to Bonus plans - it's not really too 
screw the employee, but instead to protect the well-being 
of the Company.
That's the price you pay for the luxury of a steady salary 
and a ready-made work environment including PEOPLE and
technical support. Personally, I have not been screwed, 
and in fact I have found that Atari has handsomely rewarded hard work 
and a willingness to support the Company.  Maybe my expectations are 
lower than those who feel screwed - or maybe they valued themselves 
more than  they were really worth.  
Management does care and Changes are in the 
works, they just take a long time especially when the players 
keep changing( J. Ray becomes Director, then Calfee leaves, then
Farrand leaves etc.  - you have to keep re-educating the new players).
Changes ARE underway  (no promsies, but people want to fix 
	these things if possible):
	-get rid of golden handcuffs
	-generate an advance close to initial production 

As for the "millions" Atari made on Crystal Castles, well 
lets see:
	sales as of 1/13/84: 4363 uprts; 450 cocktails
	sales revenue (approx): $2095*4363 + 1695*500 = $9.98M
		[price was reduced in DEC(?) to $1000(?)]
	cost of goods sold(fully burdened):$971*4363+971*500=$4.73M
	Engineering Expense for Crystal Castles: about $1M
	Engineering Expense for games that don't make it: unknown
	Sales/Marketing Expense: unknown
	Engineering Bonus expense:(.015*9.98M)=.15M
	Pre-tax Income: 9.98-(4.73+1+.15)= $4.1M
	After taxes (50%):		$2.05M
So the Company retains earnings of a couple of million to get thru
the many dry spells this industry faces or to buy new equipment etc.
Also note that Atari had to build about a 1000 games to break even 
on the Engineering costs. Thus, profit doesn't really appear until
1000 games are built, but Atari pays bonus anyway. I agree 7 months 
is a bit long to wait, but Atari has not made all that much and the 
product was not profitable until long after the intial production 
started. Product Bonus was paid quarterly at one time; we should go 
back to that scheme.

As for the 1% or 2%, I don't see a problem there - after all, Atari 
doesn't start making any significant money on a product till a few 
thousand are sold so it makes sense to reduce bonus funding till
a thresold is crossed.  I would however like to see another 
threshold at about $50M when the percentage increases to 5%. A game 
that can generate that much sales is a spectacular achievement 
for the creators and they deserve the reward at that point. 

The Quality of 2600 carts is the pits - no doubt about it.  The 
system was introduced in 1977 so it is SEVEN years old. I think 
Breakout and Space Invaders are decent renditions of the 
coin-op originals and those are 1976 and 1979 games respectively.
But with 14 million 2600's out there, financial issues outweigh 
asthetic issues.
I don't think the public would even buy Crystal Castles on a 2600 
so everybody loses - you and Atari.  Again, we've got new 
management and they have to learn from their own mistakes. By the 
way, Calfee knew the 2600 Crystal Castles was lousy and tried 
to stop it, but he was overuled.  When Marketing wanted to do the 
same thing with Millipede (release the cart with a bug), Steve 
had to go all the way to J.J. Morgan. Fortunately, Morgan 
agreed with Steve and the release was postponed.  One thing to 
remember though, Coin-op profits are small potatoes compared with 
Comsumer profits so every decision is heavily weighted toward 
maximizing profit in the Consumer arena. So, anticipate feeling 
screwed with respect to the quality of carts - it won't change - too 
much money is a stake.  The virtue of Coin-op is extensive 
creative freedom (in game design and hardware base) 
since original work is the lifeblood of the 
Industry. Coin-op also gives you bearable schedules allowing you to do a
satisfying job. And to my knowledge, Coin-op has yet to sacrifice 
quality to get an on-time delivery. Firefox was supposed to start 
production 1/23/84; millions in parts are all staged ready for 
production, but it has not started (1/31/84) because the software 
is not ready.
    

Now for Credits:  Coin-op credits are more complex than Consumer 
credits since more people are involved and people get their 
feelings hurt if they are left out and they feel they contributed 
just as much as so-and-so and so-and-so got their name on the game...
see my point?  John Ray has been working on this as well as 
trying to learn about being a Director and managing the 
Project Office. Maybe its could have happened faster, but John 
manages by concensus which takes even more time.
John has apparently sent his recommendation to Van Elderen/Paul/Farrand
for appproval prior to publishing  the rules for 
credits on the audio-visual portion of the product.
How does seven names in video for the
audio-visual portion strike you??  We do not want 8kbytes of 
EPROM used up putting 500 credits in the game.
By the way, Star Wars got their names in the game because they did it 
and did not tell anybody about it. If your ethics were equally 
low, Franz, you could have done it in Crystal Castles too.
  
What's all this mean? I don't know. I hope it helps though.

	I'll jump in at his point in the discussion re: BONUS.

	Many of you may not know this, but after devoting my first year here
to developing the graphics and gameplay on a game which sucessfully made it 
intoproduction (MAJOR HAVOC), I was quite suprised to find out accidentally 
during an unrelated hallway encounter that I WAS NOT BEING CONSULTED AND/OR 
EVEN INFORMED AS TO BONUS DISTRIBUTION.  Of course, this problem has since been
rectified.  However, if I had not inadventantly asked JUST THE RIGHT, SPECIFIC
QUESTION to the RIGHT PERSON at the RIGHT TIME, it would have been too late
to DO anything at all about 
                           BONUS!

	In addition, during the negotiations on that delicate subject of
BONUS PARTICIPATION, several unexpected suprises kept poking up their noses.
What this means is, of course, that the system as it has been known in the
past is now in a period of flux.  From my standpoint, that's all for the better.
	Now, in the aforementioned BONUS MEMO which makes provision for 
modifications as management decides is fitting and proper, I would like to point
out that it makes a special and specific mention of the broadening of the CORE
GROUP CONCEPT to include the new significant contributors to today's modern
coin-op games, i.e. ANIMATORS.  Of course, it doesn't guarantee that just any
lackluster tell-me-what-to-do-and-I'll-draw-it-for-you attitude will be rewarded
indiscriminately, but creative incentive and contribution to a game is something
that JUST CAN'T BE IGNORED... unless one wants to supress creativity it must 
have room to flourish and IT MUST BE PROPERLY NOURISHED. (This means BONUS)

	So, if the GOLDEN HANDCUFFS don't fit right anymore they should be
reshaped to fit with the loving skill of the patient craftsperson... but they
should be fixed right.

					Thanx,
						Barry

Subj:	BOSCOLE MCMLXXXIV


	I have been watching these soaps with some interest.  I find a wry
humor in them which might just be unique, and would like to share this with
you.

Some background context:
	At all the places where I worked before (in a "production" shop,
either as an applications programmer or as a systems programmer), there was
no bonus program.  I was considered to be a very low level of management,
and thusly was paid a salary.  Consistent with that, if the job required
extra effort, I was expected to put out that extra effort, cuz it was my
job.  That was part of the commitment.  When things went well for the
company, I enjoyed better job security.  When things didn't go as well
for the company, I did my best to correct that where I could.  It was part
of my job.  It wasn't till I came to Atari that I was involved in any
bonus plan at all.

	Since I do not contribute directly to the end product, I am not
eligible for bonuses of the type that is currently under fire.  To keep
me from grumbling about it, and to prevent me "defecting" to games
programming, I am under a "management discretionary" bonus program.  This
translates to:  If I do a good job, I get a good bonus.  If I don't, I don't.

	My first bonus at Atari really blew my socks off.  I had no idea
what to expect;  I was anticipating a $25 or $50 Christmas gift.  (On the
other hand, you guys that are handing out the bucks, now I know, and now
I would take it poorly.)  It is still nothing close to the product bonuses
that you guys are so upset about.  No, I am not going to give any more hints
than that.

Now for the things that amuse me:
	My overwhelming reaction is simple.  A bonus is a bonus.  I get
paid to do my job.  I am not entitled to a bonus, by definition, unless
I do my job better than is expected (and no such thing as a sliding curve).
If I happen to be better than the average joe, and stay that way consistently,
I wouldn't want managements expectations to rise to my superior level,
IN MY CASE ONLY.  After all, if I was worse than the average joe, their
expectations might sink ("Don't give it to Suttles, he'll screw it up")
but their standards wouldn't--I would just be a little less likely to
survive any layoffs.  A "bonus" is like a tip in a restaraunt--the
waitress cannot rely on it, it isn't automatic, and she can destroy any
chance of getting one by just not trying hard enough...which can be a
direct result of believing that the tip is a fixed amount and guaranteed.

	You guys are unbelievably lucky.  I can't speak for the rest of the
Bay Area, but in the places I worked before (in the MidWest), such a feud
as this could not happen.  People who have the gall (guts if it worked) to
stand up in a crowd and shout "management is screwing us" usually find that
from that instant onward, management is SCRUPULOUSLY honest and consistent.
They ensure they make no mistakes, and fire the sucker by the book.

	Our management here is constrained by circumstance not to point out
what I think is obvious (a bonus is a bonus).  But they are NOT constrained
to agree with the outspoken few (even tho there were a lot of letters, there
are lots more who haven't spoken up).  They are not required to support either
the point of view of the people.  They have a company to run.  They have to
make the company profitable, which takes a LOT of justification to "give away"
bonus money of any quantity.  They could quite legitimately tell you guys
"TOUGH &^$%@" (sorry, Ed), and be quite within their legal, AND MORAL rights.

	The point is that I can't fully put myself behind the revolution,
although I would DEFINITELY like to see everyone come out happy.  (If you
think I'm going to say bonuses are revolting, think again!)  It is only
here at Atari that such a discussion could come out well, and there ain't
that many places where such a discussion could exist at all.

	Two final points:  NOBODY wants to put out a shoddy product, or
even a product that is less than it could be.  And did anyone consider that
since the merge, a lot of the people against whom the shoddy products are
blamed, are on the mailing lists?

	Personal note to DanVan:  When do I get the other half of my money?

Well, a touch of sanity (old school style) at last. Actually, 
I, too, have been very pleased with my Mgmnt Disc boni, but 
it also pleases me that my boss thinks I do some decent work
and can show it in that way. But it certainly comes under

What I hope comes out of this is a greater commitment to

Subj:	ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE

Since there seems to be a lot of discussion going on about various people's
lack of satisfaction at Atari, I thought I might add yet another viewpoint.

I realize that having been in "management" for so long, and most recently 
becoming a "fellow" ("GUY" for short?), whatever the hell that is, that any 
viewpoints I express are suspect.  Still, I might be able to add some 
insight due to my ten years at a little company that made good in spite of 
itself.

First, as regards bonuses and all related monetary matters, I can say 
without hesitation that the formulation and administration of the 
engineering bonus program at Atari is absolutely the worst, most trying and 
exasperating, most thankless job I ever had to do.  The gripes, fears,
accusations, and general grief that the management of coin-op engineering 
has had to go through in the administration of the various plans is 
something I would not wish on an enemy.  (I still feel a twinge of guilt 
over dumping it in Dan's lap a year-and-a-half ago.)  In all the time I was 
handling the plan, I could only make out one general rule: THE MORE MONEY A 
PERSON MADE IN THE BONUS PLAN, THE LESS HAPPY HE/SHE WAS ABOUT IT.  I 
received nothing but gripes from the people with the big bucks, while the 
people who got considerably less, and worked their butts off in support of 
our products were genuinely thankful.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if people could give Dan and the 
other managers some support and thanks occasionally regarding the bonus 
plan that the management team would be very willing try to make the system 
work better for you when you had a problem or suggestion.

As regards credit for games, I am concerned that if we are not careful, we
will find ourselves in an industry which is as screwed up as the motion
picture industry.  Too many people in that business are out strictly for
themselves. There is no team work on many sets because of one or another
cast members who insists on taking more credit or attention than any human
should expect, and EVERYONE is vitally concerned about CREDIT (even before
quality, in many cases).  The one thing that I have always enjoyed at Atari
is the true camaraderie of the engineering group in Coin-Op.  It was the
friendships and team attitudes which made Division Street a fun place to
work.  (Ask an Old Timer what Division Street was.)

All this may sound a little strange coming from the man who "stole" the 
credit from Ed Logg for the Asteroids project.  Let me digress briefly on 
this point.  At the time when I was doing interviews and being given sole 
credit for Asteroids, this company was run by a man who did not trust 
engineers, and had a paranoia about letting the world know who our game 
designers were.  I was (for whatever reason) on the "approved" list as an 
engineer who could do interviews with the press.  I was not, however, 
allowed to name names of the engineers or programmers within our department.
My standard response to the press was that I was a member of the team of 
people who created Asteroids, but our own P.R. department, and the lack of 
other names to associate with the product resulted in my getting credit for 
much more than I ever claimed or felt.  My position on the subject, now as 
then, is that I did in fact INVENT Asteroids (i.e., came up with the idea),
but Ed Logg CREATED the game (i.e., turned an interesting idea into a
successful product), with help from the rest of the team and other people in
engineering. 

The part about "...with help from the rest of the team..." is significant.  
I am concerned that when and if the credit is given, it will get screwed up 
as it has in the case of Asteroids.  There will be hard feelings between 
people who feel they deserved more credit than they got (especially if they 
got none at all).  I think that while individual credits may be important 
and necessary for individuals, it may be the beginning of the end of good 
team feelings and cooperation within the game design groups.  WATCH OUT!

Finally, as regards coin-op programmers reviewing the consumer products 
before they go out, how could I possibly disagree that the coin-op guy needs 
creative approval (control?), especially when his name is going on the box.
We wouldn't want to be embarrassed now, would we?  Steve Calfee and his 
Damned Consumer Division Software Assholes can shove it if they think they 
can get away with this kind of insolence.  LONG LIVE COIN-OP, THE REAL 
ATARI!!  We can start another interdivisional Holy War at the drop of a hat 
(or the drop of a game cart?).  Back to the good ol' days of them 'n us!
Sure, we'll share the building, but share ideas?  Sacrilege! They can blow 
it out their VCS's!  Or maybe we could join forces and revolt against
"marketing" or "management" or some other dark and evil force in the company 
who is taking an unenlightened approach to running the business.  It's so 
easy to see and address the whole scheme of things (the pressures of running
a factory, answering to stockholders, balancing the corporate budget,
forging a new corporate management structure and a new corporate environment
in the wake of one of the most embarrassing fiscal performances of recent
history, and doing so with the lingering morale problems, etc.) from the

Subj:	RE: Blow it out your console


	I like the idea of them .vs. us.  How about the US from Atari,
and the THEM from those other corporations that are taking away our
sales, thus income, thus profits, from whence all bonus comes?

	Why do we have to do ourselves in when we could be doing them
in instead?

Hello again. 

	I am overwhelmed.  What a can of worms!!  Jeff Boscole would be proud.
Unfortunately, I don't have time to respond to everything that has been
broadcast in MAIL recently.  Nor should I, after all, I am supposed to be an
ex-trouble maker.  Still, I am glad that so many of you took the trouble to
write down what is on your mind, and then broadcasting it.  Scary, but
worthwhile. 

	This message is going to the JUNK mailing list, as did the Jeff Boscole
memorial letter.  I was unaware that JUNK included via DECNET a number of other
VAXes.  If I had known, I would have sent the JBML to JUNK anyway.  I feel no
need for secrecy.  Better to be in the open than to create inaccurate rumors. 
If you JUNK readers out there are not interested, just type del<RETURN> after
the first page of a message and the message disappears.

	Someone pointed out to me that it is my responsibility to inform the
JUNK subscribers of the prompt responses by John Ray, Chris Downend, and Lyle
Rains to the concerns voiced by the earlier MAIL.  These responses were mailed
to ENGINEERING.UAF,  a mailing list which includes only Kim Newvax users.  A
printout of some of these responses is posted in the home-computer section of
1501.

	Please don't blame me if you feel left out of the discussion. Fight for
royalties if you feel that you deserve them.  Fight for getting credit for
your work.  I am all for personalizing all of industry, everyone should put
their name to their work, good or bad.  Above all fight for quality.  Quality
sells, or are we in it just to make a quick buck? If you feel envious that we
in engineering receive royalties, consider that we (in coin-op) don't make
millions, only thousands, if we are lucky.  We earn these royalties by working
day and night, sometimes it seems putting our whole lives into it.  Even for a
successfull game designer, half the time the things don't even see production.
Usually that means a year or two down the drain. If you are unsuccessful you
get no royalties, only the nagging question: why didn't it work?  If the game
sells, you don't know why either.  Either way, you don't feel secure about the
whole thing. And nobody knows where the industry will be three years from now.
Can you blame us then for fighting for our second in the spotlight while the
power is still on?  Without game designers Atari would not exist, just like
without a screenplay you'd have a pretty dull movie.

"A video game is not a toaster"

		Sincerely,
				Franz X Lanzinger

Subj:	you guessed it

Hello UAF (whatever that means)

	Again, I'll say that I don't have time to answer everybody in
writing, but I can't resist another contribution to the maelstrom of verbiage.

	I appreciate the rather quick response from the management end of
things.  But I've heard enough of 'we are working on it'.  We game designers
work under tough deadlines all the time, we have to show continuous progress,
but you guys just say 'we are working on it'.  I've been patient long
enough.  It's time to be impatient.

	Is Atari really in the 50% tax bracket?  Or do you think I'm stupid,
Chris?  Either way, I second Ed's motion for better accounting of royalties, if
and when we receive them.  And I don't want to hear some bull about secrecy.
Why should our competition know more about sales figures than we do?  Maybe the
real reason is that there just might be a few dollars missing here or there?
Not that I am accusing anyone of foul play, but the potential is there, and
foul play has occurred at this company (as in any large company) in the past.

	Regarding bonus vs. royalties:  Are we engineers, or entertainers? Are
we grammarians, or writers of best sellers?  Are we animators or in-betweeners?
A bonus is icing on the cake for a job well done. Royalties are well deserved
rewards for directly causing huge profits (or at least a huge positive
difference in losses) for a company that is part of the entertainment industry.
Royalties are guaranteed by contracts, or at least in some legally binding
fashion.  I move that guaranteed royalties be paid to us, the in-house people
responsible for the development of our games.  This would be in line with
standard practice in the entertainment industry.  I don't really care about the
specifics.  1% of that, 3% of the other, whatever.  As long as there is some
kind of consensus of fairness, and knowing that the rug won't be pulled from
under you.  And a large payoff for a really big hit would be a great incentive.
We all dream of making another Centipede.  Too bad that all the big hits (30K
units or more) happened under the old bonus plan.

	This is a hit business.  The similarities with the movie industry can't
be ignored.  Why, we are even owned by Warner.  We are entertainers. I program
because I have to do that to make the game do what I want it to do.  If I could
do that in English with voice input, the job would be more pleasant, but it
would be essentially the same.  If the game is fun to play, its because I made
literally thousands of decisions along the way,  listening to hundreds of
suggestions.  If those decisions balance out into a game that people who play
coin-ops like to play, if it is tuned so that it earns well, and for a long
time, then we sell bunches of them. If the game isn't fun, if it is tuned
poorly, if it "cheats", then forget it, you can have an outstanding cabinet,
and excellent manual, not a single hardware problem, but people won't put very
much money into it.

	I shouldn't forget the tremendous importance of quality animation and
sounds.  Our truly amazing animators and equally astounding sound effects and
music people deserve much more credit (this includes royalties) than they are
presently getting (note Barry's message).  Without Barbara Singh, Bentley Bear
would still be a robot.  And the gem-eaters would still be dropping their
pants.

	Oops, it's almost 3 a. m., time to get to work.

Subj:	Aview from the Gruntz


	Since this seems to be the medium for voicing one's opinion,
here's mine.
	I DO understand that the game programmer is the so called
"creator" of the game. But what would your great program do without
the hardware, display, power supply, animation, audio development,
graphics, cabinet, harness, tech support, and etc!!! What we design 
here is a PRODUCT. Every person in this building (and those shoved
off to 790) plays an important role in the whole process. The team
effort is NEEDED to meet our ridiculous schedules. As soon as someone
is "better" than someone else the whole system suffers.
	The game "team" works on one project for a year or more. They 
are allowed to slip schedules as they go. They get to pick what project
they want to work on (generally). They have to answer to their team
leader and marketing.
	I get every project. I don"t get the luxury of saying, "Oh, I
don't want to work on that game." I have firm deadlines. They rarely
get slipped. You talk about working your butt off, I work my butt off
on every project. The vast majority of Design Services hasn't seen 
the sun in many months. I have worked here over five years and have
NEVER misses a set deadline. And who do I answer to? I am fair game
for abuse from:
		Manufacturing
		Marketing
		Planners
		Buyers
		Customer Service
	Ireland Manufacturing
		Components
		Team Leaders
		Engineers

		Vendors
		Brownsville

		Sales Reps
		other Design Groups
		my Management
	Some days I want to take my phone and shove it right....

	I would like to address the two specific topics at hand, first
CREDIT.
	I think as soon as you give exorbitant credit to a "few",
you slap everyone else in the face. Where do you draw the line
on who gets credit?
	Some say the difference is creativity. Designing anything
involves creativity. But when you get to the bottom line any design
is performing a task. I'm sure most of you reading this think that
my job involves no creativity. If that was true I would get a new
job. I am constantly researching new methods and new products to
improve the quality and cost of my product. Often I am thrown
problems that can't be solved without getting "creative". And i 
do like getting involved in other aspects of Enginnering that are
more creative. I don't just "do-my-job".
	If you are going to give credit for creativity, then 
everyone of us that walks by a game and says, "gee, wouldn't it
be neat if the guy swung from the trees upside down!" has helped.
And what about all the people that were creative for a year or
more but Atari chooses not to produce their game? A lot of the
time it isn't necessarily their fault it wasn't marketable.

	BONUS
	A bonus is a bonus. I would love to get much, much more.
	I'm not included in the game bonus. The reason must be
because.......I don't do anything  (?)

Subj:	VIEW #1243.


Here's another view on royalties and bonuses.  But first I should tell you
that I'm a them.  I've done VCS carts for several other companies and just
completed a computer game for Atari.

I'll give you my definition of royalty and bonus for what it's worth (so to
speak).

BONUS: Something of value given to someone for a job well done.
       Keyword - given.

ROYALTY: A method of payment for a service performed.

Companies don't give money away, they earn it or should.  If a company
could get away with paying employees 10 cent a day they would and should
because that's the U.S. way.  The reason a company pays royalties is to
retain and keep key personnel.  Royalties are not only given to entertainers
and artist, but to anyone who is a short commodity.  Salesmen recieve 
commissions in addition to other compensations in order to attrack and
keep the best.  Top level executives recieve stock options to attrack and
keep those few who have the talent to turn a little into a lot.

My point is that royalties are earned.  And I get very upset when people
refer to royalties as a gift.  It's like the gifts I give my Doctor,
Lawyer and IRS.  People who see royalties as a gift either don't warrant
a royalty or are very naive about their worth.  I also resent opinons that
someone who recieves a royalty would think they are more important or even 
more vital to the company.

I believe Atari's management (present history) is fair and concerned.  But, I
also know that chaos is Atari's only communication system and therefore 
policies take forever to be drafted.  So I think we should keep after what
we want, but I don't think it's time to burn the place to the ground.

Subj:	a different view......


BONUS. Noun 1: Something that is given in
addition to what is usually or strictly due.
2:a Brit: Dividend b: Money or an equivalent
given in addition to an employees usual
compensation. c: a premium given by a
corporation to a purchaser of its securities
to a promoter, or to an employee d(1): a
government subsidy to an industry. 2:
a government payment to war veterans. 3:
A sum of money in addition to interest or
royalties charged for the granting of
a loan or privilege to a company, or for
the leasing or transfer of property.

	 That is Webster's 7th definition of the word bonus.
I do not see anywhere in that definition where it says that
Atari (or any other company for that fact) MUST pay a sum
of money to an employee based on sales of a product
designed by that employee or employees. (hey Lyle, I made
big bucks and I'm am for sure NOT complaining!!!)
	Now don't get me wrong. I know alot of you will 
now say..."sure...you did ok by the plan, its easy
for you to say". But that is not the point. I waited 
almost 6 years before I got a product which made bonus.
I did not expect EVER in the 6 years to be paid a bonus 
and I did not stay at Atari for the bonus either. I got
lucky enough to have a product which made bonus for me at
the right time and the right place. For that Bonus I am
thankful to Atari.
	However, I do not think that any of you would NOT
be working at Atari if there were NO bonus plan. I know that
it was not really a decision when I started working here!
I think the bonus plan is a great idea, and now that I've
been included I might feel differently if it were to go.
However, we are all paid a nice salary to do our job.....
.....DESIGN GAMES. Bonus is exactly what the definition
says it is...EXTRA. If you are designing a game strictly
for the bonus it will earn you, then you are in the wrong
business!
	Ok....Atari has a BONUS PLAN. They have always
had some kind of incentive plan for the designers of 
games. I would not want to see it go. And since most of
you did come onto Atari knowing that there was some sort
of plan, it may be a very good reason to stay now. But
lets give Management a break here. I am sure John Ray,
Steve Calfee and Dan Van have had it up to the top of
their heads with grips. If Atari is going to have a
plan, I feel somewhat sure that the plan will be in the
best interests of both the company and the designers!!!
I have LOTS AND LOTS of gripes with the plan myself. I
do not like the way it distributed for example.  I
am fairly sure that no matter what plan were to become,
there would always be gripes. Not everyone is going to
be happy all of the time!
	So...I must agree with Steve Suttles in his
feelings that we should feel lucky to have ANY plan
at all. After all, it is a BONUS, not a ROYALTY!!

	Maybe we should change the subject of these
gripes to suggestions for what you might like to see 
in a bonus plan. Who knows, it just might get somewhere!!!

	As for credit on the games.....Who cares?????
How many of you sit through the credits at the end of
a movie or TV show. How many of you read every credit
in a book?? Who is the best reporter for the S.J. Merc.??
Damned if I know!!! Part of me says "yea, credit might
be nice", but then I think about it a bit longer. I
use to joke about a credit screen, with 50 or so names
running up the screen after each game:
	Designed by:
	Programmed by:
	Engineered by:
	Graphics by:
	Animation by:
	..........................etc
Gads!!!! What a bunch of junk!!!! I really don't care if
my name gets on the screen or not! But I know that if names
were to start showing up on screens, one would have to be very
careful not to leave ANYBODY out!!! I don't want that
responsibility in my program! And what happens to credits when
you need to squeeze 100 more bytes into a program???? Maybe
we could just print a small box on the side of the game with
everybody's name in it??? WOW!!!! My only gripe with credit
is that Atari did not want our names used in the media if we
were interviewed. That is no longer a restriction! There is no
more gripe!!!

	The bottom line????? This has all gotten way to far
out of hand. Are the rest of you really only staying at Atari
for the money and the credit??????

Subj:	e


just after i wrote this, I read Owens... Owen, me too.  

excerpts from what I wrote that Owen didn't say:

  No 'creative' person here is taking any risks beyond a lowered reputation
(and less job security, Steve) while working on a project.  The company has
all legal and considerable moral claim to all profits made on a project where
it assumed all costs of development.  The long hours everyone works in the 
'creative team' are really self-imposed and maintained more by peer-pressure
than by orders from management, so don't try bitching to me that you are
owed for them.
Most exciting projects come either with explicit targets (eg. FIREFOX or
GARGOYLES) or are pushed because you'll be able to do more projects and
get better marketing/manufacturing response by speeding development.
If it really bothers you to work under those deadlines, only work on
projects where you yourself can propose a schedule you can meet with an
acceptable amount of work.  Since no-one around here is willing to refuse
to meet 'unrealistic' schedules, everyone has worked excessive hours on
occasion- but most DONT make overtime pay- you do it because you think it
will pay off in: better product/better support/you won't look like an asshole
for agreeing to a deadline and missing.
 Anyone who really wants more credit than ATARI is willing to give, or more
money than ATARI is willing to give, must take the risk that other ATARI
expatriots have taken and assume more risk (that is, COST) of development.
Then you have all the control you want. Remember, 'your' game is ATARI's,
and milking it for all the bucks it can is the prerogative the company has.

		I'm all in favor of pressuring the company for
as much bonus as we can get.  Just as in baseball, the burden is not on
the players to resist making unreasonable demands- it's on the owners to
determine what the company can afford.  I think the issue of credits would
have been best left to the realm of the individual game designers, and let
the team fight it out without management interference.  
	I don't see anything but stupidity in failing to consult a
coin-op designer in developing a cross-over game; at least smile politely
at his input before it's ignored.

  BUT don't let this issue get too deeply under your skin.  Some anger is
appropriate in redressing particular issues, but don't generalize it into
a feeling that you're working in an environment where you're sure to be
burned sooner or later.  I've worked before where people bitched too often
and were unable to fully enjoy their work- and I'm not there anymore.
Nothing can ruin everyone's work environment more than an unwillingness to
feel rewarded by what you're doing, regardless of bonus or salary.  Ever
since I've been here this discussion has simmered, occasionally boiling.
It will continue to do so.  Like your mama used to say, think of the
starving Armenians (didn't your mother say that?) and eat your food.
Noone here is out to get anyone- it's a big group of people with very
diverse perspectives on what a product is and who's responsible for
what.  The diversity is also a benefit- we are exposed to a great range
of disciplines here, with a lot of resources to devote to various loosely
related products/projects.  Don't blow it.

I'm very sorry that I offended some of you.  I am relatively new here. I lead a
sheltered life over here, I bet a lot of you out there do too. The many many
people who work here all contribute in various ways to our successes and
failures.  Team-work is essential.

Regarding game credits, there are many advantages to having no credits at
all (except of course the Atari name, not to mention whoever the game was
licensed from).  The biggest advantage seems to be that noone will be
upset that they aren't included.

Still, credits are inevitable.  They will come, sooner or later.  The process
has already begun.  Many other video-game and even computer software companies
have credit policies.  Atari home cartridges even have credits on the boxes, or
in the manuals. And the day will come when live actors will appear in video
disc games.  It would be difficult to hide the names of those actors, not to
mention that they probably would be members of the screen actors guild.

Regarding royalties, or bonus, may the better company win.  Imagine
a company that gives credit and royalties where credits and royalties are due,
namely to everybody, on a project to project basis.  Such a company would
attract the best people, then produce the best entertainment products, and
then stomp the competition into the ground.  I hope that company will turn
out to be Atari.

Subj:	PPS data crunching


Hello PPS users,

	There now is a way to bypass the conversion on the PPS and do data
conversion on the VAX instead.  This means that you can take the original
.PIF files that the animators work with, transfer them (without converting
them on the PPS) to the VAX, and run them through a FORTRAN conversion program
or two to get them into a format that the DIO (and your hardware) can
understand.

	Currently the following are supported
[FXL]GP.FOR :    16x16 or 8x8 stamps, 4-bits deep. Automatically breaks
		 up larger picture buffers into component stamps.  Takes
		 as input a list of .PIF files, and picture buffer lists,
		 and produces one .INT (intermediate) file ready for
		 post-processing.

[FXL]GM.FOR :	 takes a .INT file and produces hardware specific .LDA
		 files.

More info in the comments (yes indeed, there are comments in this code).
Use at your own risk.  Best would be to talk to one of us (Kelly Turner
or Franz Lanzinger) and we'll be happy to estimate the amount of work
you would have to do to code your own GM, or to improve GP to handle
other stamp sizes, optimize stamp use, etc.

	Happy crunching

Subj:	Jeff Boscole...there is hope


	For those of you who knew Jeff Boscole, you knew what a nut that guy 
could be in his letter writting. For those of you on his "mailing list", 
you need no more proof than to read his 6 letters a week (of some 6 pages 
each).
	For those of you who did not know Jeff, most of his writtings should
be taken lightly, with an open mind and a good sense of humor. In most cases
his letters simply run on and on and usually say very little!

	However, I just received a letter (ANOTHER!!!!) from Jeff written to
the Washington State Lottery Commision regarding computer gambling! If you
received your own copy, you may stop reading now. If you did not... I thought
a number of you might just like to see this one. Not bad and all on one piece
of paper:

Dear Commisioners:

I worked for several years as a professional video-game designer
at Atari, Inc., and I'd like to register sentiment regarding the
"newly operational" computer gambling system, curiously concidental
with WPPSS #2 fire up.

The video-game industry is not without ethical standards; in fact,
by some, it is regarded as within the domain of "medical electronics."
As game designers, we were carefully instructed to conform to rather
severe standards of discipline. One of these stiff regulations
concerned this area of "computer gambling" as our video-games could
not be sold in many states across the nation if the game in any way
could be construed as a gambling device.  You will notice, for
example, that no game offers "bonus games" as a reward for playing
proficiency; we could merely offer "bonus lives" or "bonus time".

There is another reason for these stringent gambling prohibitions.
Within the programming profession there is an unwritten code of ethics
derived in part from our attitudes about electronics and computer
science.  We feel that the nature of the computer itself is antithetical
to the concept of gambling, and to promote this confustion within
the public mind may become contra-indicative to the interests of
justice and education.  Philosophically, that arrangement destroys
some fundamental cybernetic relationships by mixing up the sacred
with the profane.  Of course computers can produce pseudo-random
numbers, however, there are many of us who, very frankly, do not
want to see machines used for any gambling purposes, or to receive
any such approval and authorization from the state.  Also, we feel
that any centralized processing arrangement incorrectly pprtrays the
essence of computer science, somewhat analogous to the fundamental
statements of economics which also disallow and centralization of
economic theory.  I am acquainted with the accounts of numerous cases
within the courts in various scattered locations currently disputing
the issue of gambling at remote terminals within literary discussions
pertinent to our contemporary industry.  As we believe computer
gambling is a perversion of the design architecture, we do not support
it, and those court cases may very likely find computer gambling
inappropriate.

Many other more suitable methods are available for exposing
public consciousness to the awesome power of a computer.  Also,
we feel that some of the fun is subtracted from gambling by
having a machine automate the gambling process.  Along these
lines, I an aware, for example, that some brokerage houses tried
computer-regression forecasting on Wall Street and utilized some
artificial-intelligence automated trabsaction routines.  Since
then, I understand that many of these former computer-linkups
have been pulled off-line, as the stock brokers found their own
trading processes more adequate and perhaps more reliable.

Also, there is a danger that computer gambling might instill a
psychic disestablishmentarianism which could very easily lead to
social disestablishmentarianism and the annihilation of our legal
system.

					Sincerly,
					  Jeff Boscole

(this was cc to a large list, including 2 TV stations)

	Personally, I think Jeff did a great job here. There may indeed
be hope for him in the everyday world after all!!

Subj:	Boscole & gambling--I don't get it


   I would like to know what percentage of the Coin-op designers agree with 
Jeff Boscole's views about computerized gambling. I have only recently come 
into Coin-op so I am hardly an expert. Nevertheless, it seems to me that 
an electronic gambling machine that is designed to be marketed only in 
areas that gambling is legal should be vastly more fun than current slot 
machines (and head & shoulders above the electronic poker and black jack 
games). I would think that this would translate into vast sums of money.
   Perhaps this opinion shows that my moral fiber is loose weave or perhaps 
gambling isn't really that profitable. Either way, I hope that someone more 
experienced in Coin-op games will reply and set me straight.

I doubt that my moral fibre is more (or less) tight than
the rest of those on this Junk-line, but while I have no
MORAL objection to video gaming, I do have a practical
one, to whit: We have enough trouble with River-City
blue-noses without actually getting in bed with those who
tend to control gambling in this country. One scandal,
even if it did not directly include our machines, could
be the foundation for outlawing video games in a lot of
counties, or states. This could result in far more loss
of revenue than we got in the first place from our gaming
machines. Also, Bally virtually owns the gaming machine
business, and are not nice people to mess (e.g. compete)
with.

	On the subject of skill games vs. games of chance and ignoring
(for the moment) who controls the gambling industry in this
country, I find it more objectionable to waste money on a game (video or
otherwise) that is based soley on luck (ie. slot machines, roullette, etc.)
than to waste money on a game that involves skill.
	The payoff on a game based only on random events is completely
pre-determined before you ever put money in it.  The house determines its
cut and pre-sets its machines to give payoffs accordingly.  Anyone who
plays a game such as this will ALWAYS lose in the long run.  In addition,
there is no payoff to the player other than money and the emotional rush
of winning it (IF you win any).
	The payoff on a game that includes skill as well as luck can still
be pre-adjusted to provide a desired house percentage, but unlike the
completely random game, the payoffs go to those who have mastered the skill.
Also, even if money is not returned, the player still receives a payoff in
the form of personal satisfaction when he increases his skill level.
However, someone who plays such a game MAY win in the long run.  For the
game of blackjack, these people are known as card counters and once
identified by a gaming house are usually told not to return...
	This brings up one of many problems with games of skill that
include monetary payoffs (ie. that those who have mastered the skill are
no longer permitted to participate).  This problem does not arise in
the case of non-monetary payoffs (such as regular video games) in that
by giving extra time or extra lives (or even extra games), only the
amount of game play is extended and even the most rigourous player will
eventually drop from exhaustion.
	Another problem exhibits itself if the game is a multi-player
skill oriented game with monetary payoffs.  As an example, consider a
multi-player space war type game where you win money by eliminating other
players and receiving what they have won so far.  The house percentage
could be falling into the sun.  What do you suppose would happen out in
the parking lot if you overheard the guy in the next console scream "I just
got a ship worth $10,000!" and you had just been about to return that
much to your home base before some turkey blew you out of the sky...
	I feel that the attraction of a skill based game with some sort
of payoff is greater than a random event based game.  Unfortunately, I
dislike most of the side effects which would also be introduced with
such a game.  (The regulatory agencies of the gaming industry have a
pretty tough time with just random based games!)

	I've rambled on long enough as it is...

	Randomly,
		Rusty

P.S.  The computer is only another tool and the fact that it is used in
the process of gambling is irrelevent.  Gambling has existed far longer
than the computer.  The use of computers to disguise gambling and present
it as merely entertainment is something entirely different, however.

Hi, Coin Fans!,

	For all of you who love to hate setting up
the coin routine,  Ed Logg  and I have a surprise.
SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES]  now has  two new files,
called  NUCN69 and  NUCN65.  These new, simplified
( and more greedy )  versions of the 6809 and 6502
coin routine (respectively)  have fewer options to
worry about, and implement the new  "no such thing
as two games/coin" modes proposed by Ed for video-
disk games and adopted by Marketing for all games.

	Documentation for the new  routines can be
found in  DOC:NUCN69.DOC and  DOC:NUCN65.DOC ( you
can guess which is which ).  There is also a small
sample program in DOC:NCSKEL.MAC. Please give them
a try and complain about any bugs. These are to be
the new standards, so this constitutes the release
notice.
		Happy Programming,
		Dr. Bizzarro Albaugh

Subj:	THE FUTURE AT ATARI


LATELY THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER THE "ORGANIZATIONAL
ADJUSTMENTS" THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING HERE AT ATARI.
LET'S PUT IT ALL INTO PERSPECTIVE ...

AT THE END OF 1983, ATARI ANNOUNCED LOSSES OF OVER 500 MILLION
DOLLARS.  THERE WAS SOME TALK THAT THESE LOSSES WERE ACTUALLY
CARRIED ON THE BOOKS OVER SEVERAL PRECEDING QUARTERS, AND THAT
MR. MORGAN WAS SIMPLY GIVEN A FRESH START.  THE FACT REMAINS
THAT ATARI HAS BEEN, AND STILL IS, LOSING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF
MONEY, ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY COCAINE IMPORTER'S HEAD SPIN.

THE HOME COMPUTER MARKET HAS FALLEN FLAT ON IT'S FACE.
PEOPLE FINALLY REALIZED THAT THEY DIDN'T NEED A HOME COMPUTER
FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT PLAYING GAMES.  MOST OF THE PERCIEVED NEED
FOR A HOME COMPUTER COULD ONLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO MARKETING HYPE.

THE GAME CARTRIDGE MARKET HASN'T BEEN DOING MUCH BETTER.
WE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE BIG HOLE IN THE GROUND WHERE THEY
BURIED THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF "DEFECTIVE" CARTRIDGES.
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS THAT OUR TOP MANAGEMENT "EXPERTS"
OVERESTIMATED THE CARTRIDGE MARKET BY SEVERAL MILLION UNITS.
MEANWHILE, SYNERTEK AND STEVIE-BOY ARE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY
TO THE BANK $$$.

AND THEN THERE'S THE COIN-OP MARKET.  LET'S STOP KIDDING
OURSELVES.  SOME OF US WORK 10, MAYBE 12 HOURS A DAY ON
GAMES WHERE THE BEST WE CAN REALISTICALLY HOPE FOR IS
A TOTAL PRODUCTION OF 5000 UNITS.  THAT WORKS OUT TO SOME
VERY MEAGER BONUS-SPLITS, FRIENDS.

FEW SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO RECTIFY THE
SITUATION FACING ATARI:  WARNER REPLACED MR. KASSAR
WITH A CIGARETTE EXECUTIVE.

UNFORTUNATELY FOR MR. MORGAN, HIGH-TECH ELECTRONICS IS A
HIGHLY DYNAMIC AND VOLATILE BUSINESS TO BE IN:
THE MORTALITY RATE FOR HIGH-TECH START-UPS IS VERY HIGH
COMPARED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES.  MR. MORGAN'S EXPERIENCE
LIES IN THE VERY STABLE AND WELL-ENTRENCHED TOBBACO INDUSTRY:
IT'S A REPLACEMENT MARKET WITH TEENAGERS REPLACING THE
LUNG-CANCERED OLDSTERS.


     CIGGIES AND GAMES
       ARE SORT OF THE SAME...
     LITTLE SQUARE BOXES
       THAT TEENIES GET HOOKED ON.

WHAT THIS ALL BOILS DOWN TO FROM AN "ENGINEERING"
POINT-OF-VIEW IS THAT IT'S PROBABLY TIME TO GET ON
THE VAX AND UPDATE THE RESUME.  AND CONSIDERING THAT
THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY IS NOW IN THE 16-BIT AND 32-BIT
WORLD, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO ENROLL IN A FEW GRADUATE
COURSES.  ( HOWARD SAMS JUST DOESN'T CUT IT ANYMORE ).

FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE RECIEVING BONUS-SLPITS,
IT MAKES SENSE TO GET LAYED OFF RATHER THAN QUIT, BECAUSE
IF YOU GET LAYED OFF, YOU ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO ALL
BONUS MONEY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HAD YOUR EMPLOYMENT
CONTINUED AT ATARI.

... HOWEVER, THINGS MAY GET SO BAD HERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE
THAT IT WILL BE BETTER JUST TO QUIT ...

Subj:	COMMENTARY...


Franusic has some valid points.  However, what Atari does not need right
now are quitters.  I've seen Atari make many mistakes and I am sure that
I will see many more, but, Atari is a large corporation and it is good
to remember that Large corportations may stumble, but they seldom fall.

There will be plenty of time to decide to quit if Atari really shows signs
of colapsing.  It is true that things are not what they used to be.  Games
are not as popular as before.  The markets are glutted, both Consumer and
Coin-op.  That glutting cannot go on forever, however.  There is a product
lifetime which, once past, even the best products (for their time) cannot
be sold.  When the video game companies (Atari included) can no longer dump
their excess inventories of old games (hopefully this will not take more that

a year,) then new games can begin to go back on the market in a controlled
fassion.  When that time comes, we must be prepared with some VERY GOOD,
VERY ORIGINAL products.

Entertainment is not a fad, but repetition does not make for good entertainment.
The game industry must stop cloning the old games.  We must come up with
original concepts.  It does not necessarily mean creating bold advances in
technology.  It means taking bold advances in our imagination.  If we can
achieve that, then a games sucess is assured.

                          The Bubble Bursts

          From 1979 to 1982 Atari's growth was exponential.  The money
     was flowing in and we were the darling of the business community.
     A group of congressmen who saw High-Tech as  the  answer  to  the
     country's  economic  woes  adopted our name.  Ray Kasar's picture
     was on the cover of most the major magazines in the country.

          There is a problem  with  exponential  growth.   If  Atari's
     sales doubled every year our sales would have been $1 trillion by
     1990 and $1 quadrillion by the year 2000.  A little common  sense
     would  have  indicated  that  that  kind  of  growth could not be
     sustained and, I suppose, if you  had  asked  our  planners  they
     would  have  agreed  that a leveling off would be inevitable.  We
     all seemed to be a bit too busy to worry about that at the time.

          In ancient Greece, a  general  who  received  bad  news  was
     allowed  to  kill  the  messenger.   History  does not record how
     reliable the mail  was  in  those  days  but  the  temptation  to
     minimize  the  bad  news  must  have  been  overwhelming.  If the
     newspaper accounts are any  indication  we  had  a  very  similar
     problem  here.   If  a  market  forecast  had  indicated that the
     industry would be in the state it is in now the forecaster  would
     have  been  replaced  by someone with " a better attitude".  This
     approach guarantees surprises.

          I think it is obvious that video games were a fad  and  that
     the  fad  is over.  There are, however, two kinds of fads.  These
     are exemplified by the Frisbee and the hoola hoop.  In  the  late
     fifties the hoola hoop exploded on the scene with a force that is
     legendary to this day.  For about two years everybody had to have
     a hoola hoop.  How many hoola hoops do you see today?  None.  The
     fad ran it's course  and  returned  to  oblivion.   The  Frisbee,
     however,  suffered  a  different  fate.   If gained in popularity
     slowly at first and then reached explosive popularity later.  I'm
     sure  Wham-o  doesn't  sell as many Frisbees now as it did in the
     late sixties  but  the  Frisbee  is  now  part  of  the  standard
     repertoire  of picnic supplies and kids still play with them.  Is
     the video game a hoola hoop or is it  a  Frisbee?   For  all  our
     sakes I hope it is a Frisbee.

                        What's in the Future?

          Other then examining the entrails of a chicken, there  seems
     to  be  no  reliable  method of predicting where this industry is
     going to go.  Coin-op can make a profit and survive  on  what  we
     sell to arcades.  There is shake out in the arcade business right
     now so that avenue has dried up.  This should only be  temporary.
     The  really  big  bucks  come  from street locations sales.  This
     market seems  to  have  vanished.   Coin-op  is  addressing  that
     situation  and time will tell if the street market can be revived
     or not.  I hope so, but I also think it would be unwise to  count
     on  it.  We should view street sales as icing on the cake and the
     arcade business as our main course.
                                                                 Page 2


          There are a couple of indications that the  arcade  business
     is  going  to  stay around a while.  Our operations end is making
     money.  This is at a time when other arcades  are  losing  money.
     Our  arcades  bring in the latest games.  Many or our competitors
     do not.  National surveys indicate that collections are down  and
     I believe it is a direct result of player boredom with old games.

          A player  survey  in  Play  Meter  magazine  indicated  that
     players  will pay 1 dollar for 4 tokens at an arcade that has new
     games rather then get 10 tokens for a dollar at  an  arcade  that
     does  not.   This  magazine  is  read by almost all operators and
     perhaps the message  will  start  to  sink  in.   We  have  other
     evidence  that  new  games generate revenue for the operator.  We
     currently have several games  on  field  test.   The  collections
     reports  that  I've  read  indicate  that these games are earning
     about $100 more a week than field test games did last year.  This
     could  mean  that our games are very strong or it could mean that
     the game playing populace is starving for new games.   I  believe
     it  is  a combination of both.  Survival of the fittest indicates
     that those operator who invest in  new  games  will  survive  the
     shake  out.   This trait will be selected for and we can look for
     reasonably level sales from these operators.

          Many well meaning operators are  suffering  a  serious  cash
     flow  problem  at this time.  They want to buy new games but they
     can't.  I think Atari should help them out.  In the early days of
     the  automobile  the  car companies realized that the customer is
     willing to borrow to get a new car.  General Motors  set  up  and
     still runs the GMAC which lends money to new car buyers.  GMAC is
     a profit center itself and has helped GM make  a  great  deal  of
     money  in  the  process.  This system could work for us.  Federal
     banking laws have been relaxed a bit lately and it may be  easier
     to  do  this  then  it  has  in  the past.  Perhaps a cooperative
     venture with an established institution will serve.

                       Thoughts on the Lay Offs

          I personally feel very bad about those who have  lost  their
     job  recently.   It  is a shame that some other way couldn't have
     been found.  I realize that a great deal of  budget  cutting  was
     done  before  any  lay  off  occurred.   I only hope that in this
     chronic belt tightening we don't risk breaking off at the middle.

          If we are not well poised for the future, we risk  repeating
     our  mistakes.   There  are  new  markets  to enter.  If Atari is
     moving we increase our chances of hitting  a  moving  target.   I
     feel that new games are important.  I also feel that we should be
     ready to create the next era in entertainment.

jeff boscole lives!!!!
long may vacillating versimilitudes of veracity persist??!!

	SUNDAY night i watched a 60 minutes article on a minneapolis ordinance
to define pornography as "... any material,printed or viewed, which portrays
women as the subject of violence and domination by men, in a sexual context"
( not an exact quote) . Under this ordinance, purveyors of any material of this
nature could be sued in civil court, for violating the civil rights of the 
person suing. 
	During the ensuing "debate" between the A.C.L.U. representative and the 
proponents of the bill, I was impressed by how very sick and degraded our 
society has become. Keep in mind that the main thrust of this bill is against
so-called "snuff films", magazines that show women tied up (naked) with guns to 
their heads,etc. etc. ad nauseum. this was not an ordinance against portrayal 
of non violent sex between consenting adults. it was not the old "moral major-
ityitis" at work again. this ordinance was drafted by liberal,"rabid" feminist
types that are clearly not a threat as far as general cencorship goes.
	Still, with all that , they actually found some idiot to get up and 
defend the "right of expression" of these perverts. the old "where will it end"
argument was pulled out and waved in our faces once again. there was no reason-
able debate of the specific merits of this particular bill, but silly generic
debate on freedom of speech. 

	To me this is a good example of the thinking that could ultimately lead
to the downfall of the U.S. as we know it. I call it "fear of the grayzone",
and it has been responsible for innumerable follies throughout history.
let me point out a few other areas where this is a problem:
	1) it is currently legal to abort a fetus up to the end of the 2nd
trimester (~week 27) strictly as a matter of convenience, as opposed to medical
necessity. on the other hand, it is possible to save a premature infant as 
early as the 24th week. this has lead to "wrongful life" suits when an abortion
fails, the fetus lives, and is kept alive by new medical technology. a prime
example of a gray area in action. but instead of dealing with a real problem,
there will be an endless debate between those who see humanity in a lump of
tissue called a fertilized egg, and those who thoughtlessly consider the womans
right of selfdetermination as paramount, no matter the costs ethically.
	2) in the current political debate on El Salavador, the right and the 
left wing in this country have been polarized to almost the same extent as the 
actual participants. the left refuses to see (potential or real) manipulation
of a just cause by our enemies, and the right refuses to see death squads and 
massive political corruption in the current power elite of El Salvador. the 
invalid "black or white" political extrapolations from the politics of this 
country to the very different conditions of another country is a pattern that
blinds us to any valid considerations of how the gray areas in the politics of
the other country need to be addressed. we need to break this pattern lest the
intolerance each side associates with in the other countries politics feed 
back to our political arena and start a violence cycle in this country.
it will do us no good if the conservatives in this country are percieved as
nascient fascists by the left and the liberals are percieved as leninist symps
by the right. we need to appreciate the culture of "tolerance of the gray area"
that still persists in this country despite our stupid neglect. 

	3)etc there are examples in almost every aspect of life and
	4)etc i don't want to go on too long.

THE POINT is that our society is a finely tuned and balanced system, it is not
purely one way or the other. this is the thing we value about our country.
trying to impose rigid thought systems on a such fluidity just leads to 
distortions. THAT INCLUDES the rigid thought that there are no reasonable 
bounds on the types of thoughts and actions that can be portrayed publically.
for a society to exist there is a "least common denominator", an intersection
of ethics and morality that all people in that society need to agree on as 
the public morality. I contend that a society that hasn't the nerve to resist
incursions into this area of commonality by violent perverts and deviants that
can't resist an illgotten buck has too feeble a claim on existance and will
soon (within a century or so ) degenerate into fascistic moral repression, or
break into total anarchy. 

p.s. for those of you inclined to psuedo-mathematics I have formulated

SHERMAN'S LAW OF MORAL MULTIPLICATIVITY:

	m1*m2*m3*m4*m5*m6.....*mN<=S<<<<M

that is,coefficients along each independent axis ( or variable ) describing a
particular ethical system when multiplied are less than or equal to a constant
coeffficient (S) which is itself much less than the percieved theoretical 
maximum of the multiplication.
	in other words, to apply this equation to our legal system for example,
the more we view the legal system as a solution for attaining perfection in
our society,and the more laws we pass, after a certain point mX=rootN of S ,
where mX is a coefficient of social good in a particular area of law (such as
medical ethics), the coefficients in other areas will decline. this result 
reflects the inevitable implact of all areas of law on all other areas.

THE REAL measure of wisdom is to know the value of S, and thus know when to 
quit........and I'm not telling!!!!!!!


coming soon too your mail SHERMAN'S ETHICAL UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.

Subj:	Open Mail Boxes!!!!!


	I noticed a strange thing Friday in my main directory. My mail
file MAIL.MAI, which is usually protected from read access by people other
than myself, was NOT protected anymore! I know that it use to be protected
as I check it often. So I thought to myself...."self, maybe other peoples
mail files are also unprotected!" (This appears to be some strange bug
somewhere, but who knows where!!)
	So I checked. And sure enough, a number of people had mail files that
were not protected. "What does this all mean?", you ask. 
	What it means is that anyone, regardless of any system or other
privileges, may copy or type YOUR mail file. If you have letters in any of
these files you would rather other people not be able to read, you should
change the protection on these files.
	In case you are not familiar with the procedure, here is what you do:

	$SET PROT=(W,G) MAIL.MAI

	What this does is turn OFF access for "WORLD" and "GROUP". WORLD is
everyone but yourself. This means anybody! GROUP is anyone with the same
first 3 digits of your process id. Most everybody is in their OWN group, 
but there are a few cases where people share groups. If you don't want others
in your group to read your mail, this should also be turned off. For more
information on ACCESS PROTECTION, type HELP SPECIFY PROTECTION.

	If you are receiving this letter, the above applies to you. I only
did a check on the file MAIL.MAI, but I checked ALL sub-directories as well.
It is possible that a MAIL.MAI file is listed as unprotected but exists in
a protected directory. If that is the case, you don't need to change the file
itself.  If you wish to check other files and protect them as well, you can 
check their PROTECTION code by doing a

			DIR/PROT
on the directory. (Once again see HELP SPECIFY PROTECTION if your not sure what
all the symbols mean.)

	Any questions may be referred back to me!

Subj:	AMY 1 sound processor pricing.


The following is a memo from George Wang (ASG) and Sam Nicolino (R&D)
regarding AMY 1 chip pricing.

Excellent ASG chip plan and layout design activities have resulted in a
significant reduction in AMY 1 chip size. This results in an average sales
price (ASP) drop of $3.00 per part! Therefore, the current ASP for the
AMY 1 chip is revised to $8.82.

If you have any question about the specifications, please contact Sam
Nicolino at 745-2734 or George Wang at 745-2119.

Subj:	What the #@%^ is SYS$MAIL?


In case you've been wondering how the SYS$MAIL lists work because you never
knew or you just plain forgot, here is an updated description.

A mail distribution list is simply a file that contains a list of VAX usernames
to whom you want your message distributed. Each VAX contains in its directory
SYS$MAIL a select group of distribution lists that automatically get updated
each time a person is added to a system. The usernames are collected in groups
(some aribtrary, some based on job function) and two lists for each group are
created. One list, the .DIS file, contains the list of all users on all systems
in the network that fall into the group and the other list, the .UAF file,
contians the list of users only on the host system. You are free to use the
distribution lists located on any system in the network.

The following is a list of group types that have been established on all
systems in the network. The "real people" refers to regular users. Non "real
people" are those like DECNET, SYSTEM, FIELD, etc.

	Your choices for names of lists are:
COINOP		All real people who have accounts.
JUNK		All real people who don't mind junk mail.
WPUSERS		MUSE people (Publications and secretaries)
SCUSER		Sci-Cards people
ENGINEER	All COINOP people who arent WPUSERS or SCUSERs.
		   (before you ask, ENGINEER includes programmers too)
CAD		IC design people
UNIX		People who have expressed an interest in the UNIX O/S.
???????		More to come, watch this space

You have to ask to have your name included in UNIX or excluded from JUNK.

For example: if your host system is KIM and you want to send mail to JUNK,
(basically everyone in the network) then to MAIL's prompt "To:" respond:

	@SYS$MAIL:JUNK

(MAIL uses a default distribution list file type of .DIS)
If you only wanted your mail to go only to the JUNK collectors on KIM, then
type:

	@SYS$MAIL:JUNK.UAF

It gets confusing beyond this, but you could also send mail to users on a
specific system by including the node name. For example if your host system
is KIM and you want to send JUNK mail only to the user's on GRUMPY, then type:

	@GRUMPY::SYS$MAIL:JUNK.UAF

You should be aware that the JUNK.DIS (as well as all other .DIS files) in
SYS$MAIL on all systems are equivalent. That is, putting a node name on any
.DIS file only results in making the mailing take longer (the system has to
go to the remote node first to get the master list instead of looking on the
host system for the same list).

	Confused? You won't be after the next episode....

	Happy mailing, ('cept to the one called KIM::RICE)

Subj:	Programs and coins.

I notice that Dr. Bizzarro has just released a 'new improved' version 
of COIN65.  I would like to add my two bits to help avoid some future 
problems.

The U.S. monetary system is rather simple and can adequately be 
covered by even a subset of the coin options available in COIN65 or 
NUCN65.  However, on the international scene, virtiually every one of 
these options is required by some country or another. So PLEASE do not 
put anything in your programs to restrict these options.

Case in point is Firefox.  This game has a two credit minimum that can 
not be defeated by option switch.  This restriction effectively halves
the number of options available.  The guy that wants 
	left mech	=	one game
	right mech	=	five games
is s.o.l.


So again I say, even if people would gladly pay a dollar to play your 
game, please don't restrict the options.

Subj:	Remote ATari Peripheral Interchange Program (RATPIP)


	Dave Shepperd and I are working on a file transfer
utility that can up- or download files from the 800 to the
VAX. It will work similarly to the existing MDxx, TTVAX, DNLD,
or whatever it's called this week, which Dave Getreu's group
has been using. Now here's the problem:

	We would like to support text files too, but we aren't
sure what translation of ASCII to ATASCII will be least harmful.
In the absence of input from you folks, we will implement the
ATPIP conversion, with the exception that any files sent up to
the VAX will be type "stream_lf" (unix), because Dave is writing
the VAX end in C and thats what it writes. Other possibilities
include full conversion to ASCII, including stripping D7 (no
inverse video), sending "carriage-return,linefeed", etc. Or do
we just give up?

	Please send suggestions to me via VAXmail.
			Mike

p.s.	just to forestall the inevitable, yes we have considered
the XMODEM (alias MODEM7, AMODEM, Christensen protocol, etc.), but
the actual first customers for this beast have a PDP-11 running TSX,
and it doesn't like 8-bit "ascii", so nogo.

Subj:	A VIEW FROM A BROAD


                     IF IT'S FUN, THEN IT'S BAD FOR YOU

	I wondered when someone would get around to blaming video games for
inciting violence in children.
	So far the electronic screen has been blamed for loss of appetite,
tennis wrist, sexual transference and the seduction of a minor.
	Adults are like that. Everytime a kid is having a good time, eating
something that tastes good, or wearing something comfortable, there has to
be something wrong with it.
	Frankly, I don't see video games as being any more mind-controlling
than their fathers sitting spellbound before 86 football games a week or
their mothers mesmerized by four hours of soaps a day.
	You wanta talk violence? I can tell stories about games past that will
make your hair stand on end. In 1943, my mother grabbed a Chinese checkers
board with both hands, threw the marbles all over the kitchen and crashed
it over my father's head, claiming, "I will not play with thieves!"
	In 1954, my husband and I were playing Monopoly with a few friends.
Knowing full well that I was down to my last $50, he demanded $3,060 when I
landed on one of his utilities. When I tried to reason with him he just
snickered and said, "You're out! Why don't you just go out and get the chip
dip and snacks?"
	Had we not the children to consider, I don't like to think what would
have happened.
	There are so many things in our lives that have an effect on children,
I wouldn't know what to take away. If you don't want them to see violence,
you better hide Hansel and Gretel. If you don't want them to see sex, don't
let them see a pregnant woman. If you don't want them to know terror,
protect them from Halloween; or hypocrisy, tell them Santa Claus doesn't
exist.
	If you don't want them to be frightened by monsters and things that go
bump in the night, cut down the large tree in front of the house that makes
weird shadows on their walls when the lights are out and brushes against the
spouting. If you don't want them to see war and suffering, throw your body
in front of the TV set for the six o'clock news.
	The other day I saw two brothers fighting for control. One boy yelled,
"It's my turn!" The other one said, "Would you flake off?" THe first one
said "I'm telling Mom!" and gave him an elbow in the ribs. The second one
said, "Get out of my face," and ground his foot into his.
	A video game? Nope. A fight over a hymnal in church!

Subj:	Lazy Mail review


	In response to a number of requests for info on the lazy man's
entry to mail, here is the procedure. If you already have this working
you  should read the warnings section only. This feature is currently NOT 
on SNEEZY or GRUMPY, and Im not sure if I put it on BEEZ or not. If anyone 
on those systems has an interest, let me know and Ill add the needed changes!

	This "feature" will take you directly to mail at login time
(or restart) if you have received new mail since the last time you
ENTERED mail. ( See Warnings below).

	1). Near the end of your LOGIN.COM file (I suggest AFTER everything
that types stuff is completed), add the following line:

	$ @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]MAILCK

	2). Near the top of LOGIN.COM (BUT at least before the above line)
add the following line:

	$ MAIL	:==@SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]MAIDIR

	Now, every time you login, if new mail has been received, you will
be placed directly in MAIL. ALWAYS leave mail with an 'EX' (normal exit, not
CTRL-Y)
	Note: It is possible that after you have added all this that you
will enter mail on your next login even if no new messages have been received.
This is normal and will happen only once!

WARNINGS:
	
	A). This does not really check for new mail, it simply looks
to see if the revision number of the current mail file matches the
number from the last time you were in mail. If you enter mail then leave
without reading anything, the revision is updated and you will NOT enter
MAIL even if your are told you have new messages, unless additional
messages have been received!

	B). If you use BATCH, then a conditional branch must be made about
line 1 which calls MAILCK.  If you never use BATCH, skip to item C.
If you already have an area of LOGIN.COM for "INTERACTIVE" items only, 
put the line in that section. If the last sentence appears to be GREEK 
to you, then add line 1 (from above) as follows:

	$ IF "''F$MODE()'" .NES. "INTERACTIVE" THEN GOTO SKIP_CHECK
	$ @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]MAICK
	$ SKIP_CHECK:

	C). Note that this re-defines the word MAIL to call a special
COM file. Mail will still work as it always has, however, this COM file
will display a list of all your mail files when you type MAIL. To skip
the list, simply add anything after the word MAIL. (ie: MAIL N)

	D). Since this ONLY re-defines the word MAIL, it you try to get
to mail in any other way (ie: MAI, MAILS), then the COM file is NOT 
executed. In this case, you will enter mail on next login even if no
new mail was received!

	E). These additions in no way effect LETTERBOM. If you have
made that change, it will still work as expected. If you have not
made that change, you probably dont care what this means anyway!

	F). When using this, a new "file" will appear in your directory.
It will be called MAIL.RVN. Do not remove this file. It uses only 1 to 3
blocks. If you do remove it, MAIL will simply put it back and you will
enter mail on your next login even if no new messages.


	Problems should be mailed back to me! Thanks

hello LINKM users,
	I jut came across a truly nasty bug/feature in LINKM.
(make that just). In my .LNK file I have several lines of files
with /C (for continuation) at the end.  The last line of course
doesn't have one.  That is until you hurriedly delete that line
without thinking, which is what I did.  That makes the previous
line the last line, and that of course HAD a /C at the end.

	Now for the bug.  LINKM doesn't complain about the
superfluous /C on the last line, it just doesn't make a .LDA
file.  It took me two days before I realized that I was down-
loading my old .LDA file, rather than my new one.  Now that
you know, maybe this will decrease the chances of this
happening to you.

Subj:	Yet another PPS utility

I have just completed a PPS utility to compress unwanted (duplicate)
stamps out of a set of stamps.  The utility is called COMPRESS
(presently located in [BABCOCK.PPS]) and takes as input a .INT file
(generated by FXL's GP program).  The stamp size (in multiple of 4
pixels) is also specified.  The utility creates a new, smaller .INT
file (how small depends on the reduction in stamps) and a .MAC file
containing a translation table between the old stamps and the new
stamps.  See the file [BABCOCK.PPS]COMPRESS.DOC for further information.

I have also modified GP to accept a stamp size.  This allows GP to
do both row-oriented (playfield stamps) and column-oriented (mo stamps)
conversions for any square stamp (multiple of 4 pixels).  This version
of GP can also be found in [BABCOCK.PPS].

To see the result of these new utilities, drop by the Garfield lab
(Joe's Bar 'N Grill), or see me.

Subj:	and now the bad news


	Apparently the price estimate that Yamaha quoted for their chip set
didn't quite cover their costs.  I was first told that they were going to
stick to the $15.70 they had quoted me, but the new word is that the very
embarassed Yamaha manager is in hot water with his bosses, and the new price
is $19.30, FOB Japan.  I personally think the chip is well worth the extra
$3.60, but if this is going to change anyone's mind about using it, please

Subj:	TI speech option, Yamaha&Pokey clock rates


	Does your game have trouble reproducing the speech patterns of 
females and (other) alien life forms?  If so, you may wish to avail yourself
of the 10 kHz sample rate option.  The current sample rate is 8 kHz, which is
optimal for male voice and requires less memory storage.  To use the 10 kHz
option, you must:

	1)  Change the clock for the TI 5220 from 640 kHz to 800 kHz.

	2)  You may need to adjust any lowpass filter for the speech output,
as the new bandwidth will be 5 kHz instead of 4 kHz.  The cutoff frequency
can have a big effect on how the speech sounds - see me for details.

	3)  Tell us to analyze your speech at the 10 kHz rate, and to have
RPM call the speech routine a little more often.  (The new frame period is
20 ms instead of 25 ms.)

	4)  Allow for 25% more rom storage (I would let this be a deciding
factor only if there is little difference between the sound quality at the 
8 and 10 kHz rates.)

	If you're unsure which rate to use, or if you have sound effects or
a mix of male and female voices you wish to try, we can try it both ways and
see which sounds best.  

	While we're on the subject of clock speeds, Brad mentions that since
the Yamaha chip needs a 3.579545451 mHz (colorburst crystal) clock speed,
it will be easy to derive the 1.7etcetc mHz clock to run the pokeys at the
speed at which they run on the 800, so that the sounds we develop on the
800 development system won't sound different in the games.

Subj:	Editing before you send mail.


Just got a piece of mail with  ' [O ' in it.  This normaly happens when you
are sending mail and make an error, and then try to correct it with the Editing
keys. The mail editor just doesn't understand those little arrow keys or the
keypad ones either.  But there are a couple of ways to beat them little guys
and have full editing capabilities while writing them long 'Boscole-ish' works
of art.


1. You want to keep a copy for later use and/or modification:

    step a)	Create the file and "EDIT" it with your favorite editor.
    step b)	Enter  "MAIL" and type S or SEND leave a space and then
    		type the name of your file. Ex: SEND FROBOSH.MAC

    	This will send the file to all those you select on the 'TO:' line.


2. You just want to use the 'EDT' editor and don't care about keeping a copy:

    step a)	Enter "MAIL" and type S or SEND followed immediately by /edit.
    		Ex: SEND/EDIT

    step b)	Mail will place you in the EDT editor and allow you to edit
    		to your hearts content. When you finish, simply do a normal
    		exit from EDT.

3. You want to use the 'EDT' editor and don't care about keeping a copy, but
    you would like to send something you have already created (some code or
    a copy of some file) and add a message to it or even modify it before you
    mail it.

    step a)	Enter "MAIL" and type S or SEND followed immediately by /edit
    		and then a space and the name of the file you want to include.
    		Ex: SEND/EDIT FROBAHS.LST

    step b)	Mail will place you in the EDT editor and allow you to edit
    		to your hearts content. When you finish, simply do a normal
    		exit from EDT.

Good luck and have fun.

Subj:	Who's on first (or BEEZ or DOC or BASHFL,...)


With the addition of many new VAXes (VAXi?), there are also many more users
spread throughout the system.  Many people have wondered how to find out
where someone else might be in the network in order to send them mail or
call them up via the PHONE utility.  Well, there is a way, sort of...

The PHONE utility has a DIR command that will tell you who is currently
logged in, their terminal, and whether or not they are available for
phoning.  Normally, this command only tells you the users on your home
system (node).  However, by appending the nodename after the DIR command,
you can also see who is on the other systems.  What are the names of the
other VAXes, you ask?  The command SHO NET will tell you which ones are
currently reachable from your system.  For example:

	SHO NET		This will list the other VAXes you can reach
	PHONE		Enter the phone utility
	DIR HAPPY::	This will give you a list of all the users
			currently logged into HAPPY (note that the
			double colon is usually not required,
			except for the node DOC.


The only drawbacks are:
	1) You can only see the users on one system at a time
	2) You can only see those currently logged in (however, this might
	   be what you are after, if you want to phone that person)

Happy phoning,
	Rusty


P.S.	The phone utility contains its own HELP function for those who are not
	familiar with it.

Subj:	software piracy revisited again and again

It has been brought to my attention that some stolen Atari computer 
software may now be residing on one or more of our VAXes. 

This is intolerable.

We are a company whose existance depends on software sales, and every
ATARI game that was in a cartridge and has been put on disc and then
on the VAX is a potential leak to the outside world that can impact
sales. Any competitors' games that might be on the system could 
substantially weaken Atari's cases against piracy in court. People
who participate in stealing software are risking their jobs and the
company's future. 

Please delete all questionable files immediately!!!

Once again, people in this building are reported to be in possession of
stolen ATARI property, taken from computer bulletin boards. The titles
are BALLBLAZER and FINAL LEGACY. People must not have this stolen 
property in this building or elsewhere!! This is a crime and, if caught,
your employment will be terminated.

As Jed would say, Thank you or else.

Subj:	The biggest joke.


What's the biggest joke at Atari?  Stolen software.

I've been very frustrated with all the apathy at Atari toward stolen
software.  Almost everyone here has stolen software and when confronted
the answer is usually a very proud smile followed by "Yea but....".

The reason I'm now on a soap box screaming is because I designed and
programmed 'Final Legacy' which has just gone to ROM's and is already
being passed around on disks.  Yes I'm mad about it, but people who know
me know that I've been screaming about stolen software for a very long
time.  So this letter is not sour grapes.  I picking this time because
maybe you'll feel sorry for me and listen to what I have to say.

Legacy was stolen by someone outside Atari and I believe it could not be
prevented.  These things happen and part of our business.  The people 
involved are going to be nailed.

The sad part is that a copy showed up at Atari.  The person saw nothing at
all wrong with having the copy.  I've kept from finding out who the people
are so I don't end up hating anyone here, I'd rather not know.

Well that's the background.  The issue is stolen software and why are we
doing it.  I beleive that stealing or receiving stolen software is a crime,
no buts.  I also believe engaging in these activities at Atari is a crime
and stupid.  Our pay checks depend on selling software.

I don't buy the excuses that pirating doesn't hurt those big fat companies,
or it's just one copy, or it's from another company.  If you only steal
non-Atari software then you are condoning people who do.  We can't be in
the grey area debating whether or not priating is ok or not.  I think
that we should denounce piracy at every chance and not be hypocritical
in doing so. 

Other software companies have policies where having stolen software is
not tolerated, if a person is found with stolen software they are fired
on the spot.  What it has done for the employees is given them a very
strong sense of pride in their work.  They know that the company places
a great value on their products.  Also, I've never heard of anyone being
fired.  But then no one pirated software either.  Make no mistake, everyone
knew that the rule would be enforced.

If I have offended a pirate or two out there tough, I don't much care for
pirates anyway.  I do hope I've reached people who have stolen software
that maybe it isn't right and they should get rid of it.  And to all the
people who denounce software piracy, let's keep the spirt alive.

Subj:	The Right To Junk Out!!!


	There have been a number of complaints by a number of persons
in various ranks about a number of other person's contributions (or
the believed lack there of) to JUNK MAIL. In fact, several of the
complaints have requested the restriction of certain persons from sending
junk mail at all.

	I would like to remind all of you on JUNK mail, that JUNK mail is
exactly what the name implies....JUNK!!!!! You get exactly what you ask
for...JUNK! There are other distribution files designed for distribution
to ENGINEERS, EVERYBODY, etc. The JUNK list was added so that persons
interested in non work related items could share a common distribution
file!

	I have discussed this matter with a few persons, system people
included, and for the most part, we have come up with a few,  very easy
solutions to the complaints. If you are receiving JUNK mail from people
which you find annoying or bothersome, here is what to do:

	1). When the message appears on your screen, simply DELETE it
immediately and go on to the next message. This takes 3 SECONDS! I think
that inconvenience can be tolerated!

	2). You can read it then delete it (if your inclined to self
abuse). This takes 15 to 30 seconds. But why bother if you don't like
that persons mail!!

	3). You could write a COM file to run at login time which
goes through you mail file and removes letters from the bothersome
people. Frankly, I would forget this method!!!

	3). If your still bothered, simply tell Dave Shepperd, Steve
Suttles, or myself, and we will be more than happy to REMOVE YOUR NAME
FROM THE JUNK LIST! That way, your NEVER bothered by anyone!

	Problem solved!!!

	In contrast to the above and in defense of one very good argument
against JUNK mail (I will not say from whom it came), one problem still
exists! Namely, persons spending too much of their time creating such JUNK
masterpieces (such as this). It is believed in these cases, that the offending
person's manager should be responsible for any such restriction or limitation
to be placed on that person. But please keep in mind that if such a person
wishes to use his/her own time (lunch or after work) for writing such
"garbage", then the complaining parties should once again see the solutions
above.

	Personally, I find most of the junk mail entertaining and quite good
for morale. And right now, raising morale should be a top priority around here!
It takes no more that 10 minutes out of my day to read the mail, and if I 
think it may take longer, I print it, take it home,  and read it later!

	BASHFL::SYS$USERDISK:[DYER.C.MAKE]*.*

to wit:		MAKE.MAN	manual
		MAKE.COM	DCL front end
		MAKE.EXE	executable
		MAKEFILE.	makefile for MAKE

		MAKE.H		source
		*.C		more source


If you want to use it, copy the first four files (you can use MAKEFILE as a
template for your own needs.)  Unix and Eunice people will discover that this
version of MAKE is not exactly like the "official" one; don't expect it to
work with makefiles you already have.

To install it, put these two lines into your LOGIN.COM:

	$ DEFINE MAKE$MAKEDIR <directory that MAKE.EXE and MAKE.COM are in>
	$ MAKE :==@MAKE$MAKEDIR:MAKE

then type 'MAKE', and you are on your way.

Bugs, suggestions and letter bombs to BASHFL::DYER (assuming BASHFL's network
interface is in a good mood.)  Happy hacking!

	Here we go again...

	Although I have many "real" concerns in my life (ie: World peace,
	Nuclear diarmement, Governmental sanity) I find myself from time
	to time getting really tense about something trivial.

	  In Junes' Antic (page 79) there is an add. for a new book..

	$14.95... "THE ART OF COMPUTER GAME DESIGN: 
			REFLECTION OF A MASTER GAME DESIGNER"

				written by
				none other than... CHRIS CRAWFORD
							(ex Atari programmer).

		" ... Chris Crawford, Atari programmer PAR EXCELLENCE, 
		      teaches this and other noteworthy lessons... "


	   peee-ewww.

		I have never met this man.. (ie.. I hold him no grudge)
		I have seen him on " Bits Bytes and Buzzwords" (2 weeks ago)
		He has been billed as THE Atari game Wizard
		  (some say he isn't even a wizard.. let alone the ONLY one.)

		WHY ???

			  

		It should be noted that by all indications Atari itself
	    responsible for this (grossly incorrect) billing. Mr Crawford
	    has just helped it along.
	
	
	       nothing else to say..

Subj:	Using the printers.


	Most of you are already familiar with the following
"rules" which apply to the computer line printers. However,
there are a number of new people in the building who are
obviously not familiar with the so-called 'printer etiquette'
rules. This is obvious from both observation and complaints.
To help solve these new problems, I am re-sending the original
letter  on printer etiquette (edited for television). This applies 
to you if you use any of KIM or ERNIE's printers. The users on 
the 730's should work out something similar with their printers!

I would like to suggest the following "rules" as a possible
way of eliminating these so called problems.
1). When you remove your listing from the back of the printer
    it would be very nice if you would:
	a). leave any listings that are "in front" of yours
	    separated and on the table across from the
	    printer. There are other people doing this for
	    you right now.
	b). If you are leaving listings "behind" yours
	    still attached to the printer be sure that you 
	    leave them stacked correctly in the basket.
	c). Please leave the paper that may still be coming
	    out of the printer like it SHOULD be so that
	    it will continue to fold properly in the basket.

2). Please be sure that you leave the printer ON LINE.
    (It has been found off line a few times!) At the end
    of each listing 3 form feeds occur to 'push' the listing
    to a point where it may be torn off. There should be no
    need to turn the printer off-line! But if you do.....

3). If it runs out of paper, at least notify an operator or
    a systems person so that new paper may be inserted. If 
    it is late at night, you might like to put the paper in 
    yourself.
	a). If you are not aware of how to PROPERLY insert
	    paper into the printer, please see any system's
	    person and they shall give you a quick demo. Its 
	    easy, even a child could do it!!!!!!

4). Please be careful that a small listings belonging to someone
    else is not "attached" to the listing you take from the printer
    room. If you do take one of these listings....please PUT IT BACK
    in the printer room...not in your stack of old listings. This seems
    to be one of the complaints heard most often.

	Please be advised that it is now possible to tell who it may be
that is screwing up the printers. Given the "id" of the listing on either
side of a supposed screw up, it is now possible to tell who it was that 
may have caused a printer problem. "Big Brother" may indeed be watching 
your listing! (you may have your hand slapped with a wet noodle if found
guilty!!!)

	As you know, operators do not monitor these printers. 
Therefore it is up to us, the users of these printers to help things 
run smoothly for all users. So please try and be more considerate of 
the rest.......
				Thank You,
				   Big_Brother

To:	@SYS$MAIL:ENGINEER
Subj:	What's an Audio Game, Anyway?

	This here's the first round of a VAXMAIL brainstorming session
on the subject of audio games.  Please send any ideas or comments to me
and I will in turn forward them back out to everyone who has written asking
to be on the mailing list.  (Let me know if you don't want your comments
broadcast in this manner.)  This process will repeat with a new round every
few days until we've stormed our little brains out, at which time an in-person
meeting might be appropriate.  If this type of brainstorming works (or even
if it doesn't), it might be a good way to work on other topics as well.

	The first rounds can be totally off the wall (much of the stuff below
is), no ideas rejected as being too strange.  Later sessions can start to
refine the ideas into something practical. 

	So what's an audio game, anyway?  

	Mike Albaugh's been wanting for a long time to do some sort of
interactive radio play.  Remember the days (before my time) when you would
go to bed and turn out the lights and turn on the radio real quiet so your
parents wouldn't hear, and listen to The Shadow and all those other creepy
old plays.  Most of us TV brats missed that experience, but they say the 
pictures are better on radio.  What if you could interact with the action?
Wouldn't it be nice to start a new fad?  I'll try listing some different
categories that might come under the loose heading of audio games, in the
hope they might cross-fertilize in someone's mind.

	1). CB radio became sort of an audio game for a while, and made a lot
of money before the fad died out.  Just as people like Gutenburg and Ralph
Xerox helped make everyone their own publisher, the CB let everyone be their
own radio station, although with a very low signal-to-idiot ratio.  I
personally think everyone should have their own TV station, but that's another
subject.  

	2). Some computer bulletin board services like The Source(?) have CB
simulators that let strangers talk to each other, and some even let you publish
poems, articles, etc., and pay you a royalty for every time someone reads them.
People seem to like to talk to complete strangers, and the thought of getting
paid for spewing your stupid ideas all over the globe is even more attractive.

	3). The telephone seems to be one ideal medium for audio games. 
Everyone has one, for starters, and most people have played games with them.
Like calling random numbers and asking if the person's refrigerator is running.
Computer abusers and phone phreaks tend to go together (the phone phreak
newsletter, TAP (Technology Assistance Program) deals with both.)  The 
dial-a-joke, etc. numbers are one way communications (Wozniak had an especially
bad one), but there have been a few interesting two-way phone services (almost
all in California.)  One of them had two lines, one to leave messages and one
to listen to other peoples' messages.  I assume the people who ran it did some
editing, because there was lots of good material on the listening line.  People
say really funny and bizarre stuff sometimes, if they don't have to say it in
person.  Another service would hook you up to one or more people who had 
happened to call at the same time - talk to strangers without the guilt of 
waking up people by dialing random numbers.  If anyone knows of numbers like
this that are currently in operation, please share them.

	4). A conceptual art project that I'd like to do someday is to
broadcast my life by telephone.  Walk around wearing a microphone, and a
little transmitter that sends the signal to a base station, where there is
an answering machine.  Anyone can call at any time and listen to whatever
you're doing.  (Employers and lovers might not appreciate this.)  The art
of banality, the thought of listening to someone's boring everyday events, 
and knowing it's real, and live. (Oh, sounds like he's eating dinner now...
sounds like he's throwing up now...)  Just fascinating stuff.  I would call, 
for sure, even if it was my life being broadcast  (Yup, sounds like my life, 
all right.)  A related project is to tape record my whole life, 24 hours a day.
I need a very slow running tape recorder.  I just like the idea of someone
sitting down and listening to the whole piece.  Or I could sell the tapes,
in one day units.  The trading of tapes could be incredible (Have you heard
August 18, '83 yet?  Primo!)  

	5). And of course there's Phone Sex.  Pages and pages of ads in the
back of Hustler, etc.  $25 - $36, charge it to your Visa.  The one I called
was a blatant rip-off, and you can't contest credit card charges below $50.
They must not be interested in repeat business.  (If anyone knows of any good
ones, again, please share!)  

	6). So back to the idea of interactive plays.  If they were done by
telephone, you could tell people how the phone push-buttons correspond to
commands. The number keys could be N, S, E, W, etc. for an adventure type game.
The star could be a help key, numbers could correspond to multiple choices,
etc.  Most people still have no experience with adventure games of any type,
and would gladly play them if they were fun, required no extra hardware, and
didn't require you to know how to read.  Much more desirable would be doing
voice recognition to determine the next move.  Who wants to listen to a touch
tone phone beep in your ear while you're listening to a play?  People would
be fascinated by a system that could interact with them verbally.  People 
often told their deepest secrets to the Eliza (psychotherapist simulator)
program, even through a keyboard.  The effect would be that much greater with
voice recognition.  Voice recognition would be difficult, computationally
expensive, and would need to be fairly fast and speaker-independent, for a
limited vocabulary.  It is probably do-able.

	7). There could also be 2 (or more) person phone games.  You could
talk to the other person while you play, or you could get to know them only
through the moves that they make, as translated by the computer to you.
Your voices could be electronically disguised, vocoded, signal processed, etc.,
perhaps to the extent that the other player's speech is not even recognizable,
but comes over only as a sound effect. 

	8). Phone games could eventually expand into something like the Source,
where you have a menu of a number of different types of activities you can
participate in - 
		Games
		CB / party lines
		Voice store-and-forward messages which are indexed by titles 
			that other people can call and listen to, etc.
		A menu of sound effects (might be fun for young kids, and it
			would be easy to do.  Type 378 and hear walruses
			sneezing, etc.)

	9). Perhaps Atari-Tel could sell a special phone for game play 
(preferably a speaker-phone).  The processor for the game would be in the
phone, and the base station would just download programs and play sounds when
the user's game phone requests them. Anyone know anyone at Atari-Tel who would
be interested in participating in this dialog? 

	10). How to make money at this?  Albaugh's idea is not to try, just
put an ad for the latest Atari game at the beginning of the call.  Credit
cards need a live operator, kids don't have 'em, and the games had better 
be real good.  There's a new phone service, offered by General Telephone
and perhaps Pacific Bell, which allows people who run a phone service, like
dial-the-weather, to get money from the call, which will show up on the
person's bill.  You set the rate for the call - $.50 or whatever.  This of
course is in addition to how much the phone company gets if it's long distance.
I believe this service is only available in L.A. currently, but if it is
expanded to other cities, we could set up whatever hardware we develop in
each major city.  This is a fairly painless way for people to pay for games -
you don't see the bill till much later.  Also, it's free for kids (parents 
pay the phone bill.)

	11). How do the economics of this work?  I'm not sure. Do you have one
simple hardware system, maybe the price of a coin-op game, which can only
handle one call at once?  Do you use a more powerful system, which can play
many games at once?  Here's some things the hardware might need to do -

		Decode touch-tone phone beeps 
		Voice recognition
		Voice synthesis
		Random access of lots of sounds, speech, music
		Analog or digital signal processing of player's voice
		Lots of disk space for voice store and forward
		Letting multiple players talk to each other
		Decode serial data from a user's game phone
	
	12). Another idea is to not do this by phone at all, but with some
sort of audio game machine.  There could be a Walk-man type machine, with
a couple of cassette tapes and a microprocessor to control the game.  Seek
times are a problem.  Or there is the possibility of getting a compact disk
manufacturer to add appropriate controls to let you play audio games with your
CD player.  Especially if such games were played with headphones, there are
3-d spatial illusions that can be done that will knock your proverbial socks
off.  CD software is expensive and the seek times are a little slow, but it
shouldn't add much to the cost of the player.  The market is currently small,
however. 


	Anyhow (finally), these are some of the ideas that have been floating
around.  Send yours, don't delay.  And even if you are temporarily struck 
idea-less, let me know if you want to be on the list to get further rounds
of this dialog forwarded to you.

Well, I've got 8 responses so far (that's 10 octal) so how about a
meeting tomorrow at 12:15 in the multipurpose room.  To clear up one
possible point of confusion:  A game designer is someone who contributes
to the design of a game.  That includes sound, graphics, hardware, in other
words, most everyone who works in 1501.

   This will be mainly an organizational meeting.  We will be looking
for volunteers to help with various tasks.  We will try to write down
goals and the purpose of AAG.

   There is a similar organization called the Association of Video Game
Designers.  I know little about this group, other than the article
posted on Karl Anderson's door.  It seems though that the scope and
purpose of AAG would be different.  AVGP focuses on video game designers
and their fight for adequate compensation and recognition.  AAG will
focus on games in general, and will try to stay clear of politics and
controversy.

   See you tomorrow

To all who use 68000/10. and specifically those using Intermetrics s/w.

The new release is now up. There are a few points worth noting about it.

	CLNK	Is the linker.
	CLOC	Is the locator.
	CFOR	Is the formatter.	
	CLBR	Is the librarian.
	XREF	Is the cross reference utility.
	SYMLIST	Is the symbol lister.
	CMAP	Is the Mapper. or
	GSMAP	"            "


In order to use the new release you must do:

1.
	$ @sys$sysdevice:[as68r1v2.com]cdefs.com
  	  in your login.com file.

2.	the files on the CLOC command line must now be separated by commas
	and a /o= file.ln is required, or just /o will use the input 
	filename that is first in the list.

3.	The CLNK requires a /o.

4.	The CLOC requires a /o.

5.	The CFOR requires a /o and the /de still does not produce symbols
	compatible with the emulator. so use GENSYM for now.


The new stuff is in sys$sysdevice:[as68r1v2].
The library & sources are in sys$sysdevice:[c68kr1v1].

It really is much faster now. any problems call me.

Subj:	A new printer on this side!


	Are you tired of walking ALL the way down to the other side
of the building to get your listing? Tired of cleaning up the printer
for someone elses HUGE listing? Want to be lazy like me?

	Well, now your in luck.

	Just opened, the new "south" printer room. The new printer is
located in the same room as the Richo copy machine. I know, your saying
I've seen that piece of junk torn apart in that room. Well, not any more.
Now we have a brand new, never been used Printronix 300 line printer.

	How do you use it, you ask?. Its simple.

If you are on KIM, then:

	Add the following line to your login.com file:

       $ASS 'F$LOG("SOUTH$PRINT")  SYS$PRINT
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                   |||||||||||||--this MUST be uppercase

	Or you may type that at any time. 
	This will the automatically cause all print jobs of yours to 
go to this printer. You must DEASS SYS$PRINT to return to printing at
the other printers.
	OR you could add the line:

	$sou*thprint :== "ass ''f$log("SOUTH$PRINT")' sys$print"
so that typing SOUTH will cause listings to be qued in the south printer.
Caution: Make sure the line is types EXACTLY as shown. SOUTH$PRINT must be
upper case and don't leave any ' or " out!On
------------------------------------------------
If you are on ERNIE or BEEZ:

	Simply type:    $PRSOUTH filename.
(PRS filename is all you really need, the rest is for people who like to type)

	NOTE: Remote printing will ONLY print a file. It will NOT act like
a normal print que for other programs such as MAIL or MUSE. However, there is
still a way to get your listing in these cases.
	This means that your job or jobs should NOT que a listing for printing,
but simply keep it in a file. Then use the PRS command to print it.
(After you get your listing, you may wish to delete the print file to save
on disk space)

MUSE users, simply give a name to MUSE when it asks for what printer. If
MUSE cant find a printer with that name, it simply creates a file which
has that name, and adds the extension .LIS. When you exit MUSE, type PRS 
followed by the name of you gave MUSE.
MAIL users should simply FILE the desired messages for printing to a mail file
then PRS the mail file. Note, however, that you MUST change the protection
on the newely created mail file to world read or KIM won't be able to copy 
the file. See me for more details if interested in doing this!
------------------------------------------------
	As with the other printers, your are still responsible for keeping
this room neat and clean, stacking listings, and refilling the printer if
empty. If you don't know how to refill the printer, Dave Shepperd, Steve
Suttles or I will be gald to show you how.  At this time, no paper is being 
stored at this location, but that should be changed in the near future. 
For the time being, you must go to the old printer room and snag a box 
for yourself. Since there will only be a few of us using this printer,
and I'm only telling the people at this end of the building, the job
should be a simple one and I doubt if the printer will need to be fed 
paper very often.

	Thanks

you.  Apparently, the Devsys has quite a few bugs still, one of which
is that the DTx function will lock up the system if there are too many
symbols.  A temporary cure for this is to selectively delete symbols
from the file that you download.  I have changed Jim Morris' gensym
program to allow an optional third file.  To use the new gensym program:

    In you login.com:
	csym :== $sys$userdisk:[packrat.68000]gensym

    In your link68.com:
	$ csym file.ab file.sym [file.exc or file.inc]

    What this .EXC or .INC file will do, is look for symbols that match
the strings in the file.  If there is a match, then the symbol is
either left in the .SYM file if the extension is .INC, or left out of
the .SYM file if the extension is .EXC.  Some examples:

	ab*
	M_FOO
	M_G*

    will match any string starting with ab, a string called M_FOO, and
any string starting with M_G.  Any letters after the * will be ignored.


    So, a recap, if you want to exclude a set of symbols, use a file called
file.EXC, and fill the file with strings to match the symbols you don't
want.  If you want to keep a specific set of symbols, then use a file
called FILE.INC, and fill the file with strings to match the symbols you
want to keep.

    Any complaints, comments, praise, MONEY, will be gladly accepted.
    Abuse gladly returned to owner.

	Peter Thompson.

Subj:	Auf Wiedersehn


  Hello coinop

	With regrets, and after much soul-searching, I have decided to resign.
While there are many factors that went into this decision, by far the most
important is the following:

	On Monday I took the following position:  put the present product bonus
plan in writing, or I will quit.  More specifically I would need to be assured,
IN WRITING, and in a LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT, that such events as the sale of
Atari Corp., or getting laid off (or fired) by new or existing management, do
not affect the payment of past due royalties.

	I was informed that this would not happen in the near future, if ever,
but I was assured that the present bonus plan is still in effect until further
notice and that the August payment would "probably" be paid on time. 

	This put me into a difficult dilemma.  Do I stick to my word, and
possibly lose a large (>$5000) bonus in August, and possibly even larger sums
of money next February for consumer cartridge sales.  Or do I go back on my
word and stick around a while longer.  I admit, I had to think about it.
From a purely greed standpoint it would be stupid to turn down the chance
at that much money for one or two more months of work.

	But then I read one the robot stories by Asimov, called "the
Bicentennial Man".  In it a robot buys his freedom for $600,000.  The robot had
earned the money by producing wood sculptures.  He argued that money is no
object when it comes to freedom.  I agree.  I can no longer work for any
organization that treats the creators of its products like pawns in the
corporate game of chess.

	My plans for the immediate future are to relax, and take a break. Then
I will seek out new corporations, and go where no game designer has gone
before.

	I have enjoyed working with all of you, its been fun.  You can
reach me at (xxx) xxx-xxxx.  The answering machine message is strange
sometimes, but then what else would you expect.

	Good luck to all of you,
			Franz X Lanzinger

( the X stands for ex Atari employee)

Subj:	More VAX classes.


I found a neat but UNDOCUMENTED (which means we have NO books on it contrary to
what the program will tell you) program on Turtle that you may be intrested in
running. Its VMSCAI which is a VMS tutorial resident on the vax. For the novice
user and "once in a while" user it can probably be a great help. Its been
copied to all the systems. To use it type: 

	$ MCR VMSCAI

and do what it says. It will only work on a VT100 or a CIT101, however. The
keypad key PF2 is always a HELP key, and the PF3 key is an EXIT key. Repeated
pressing of the PF3 will exit each level of the program until you're all the
way back to DCL.

RAM USERS BEWARE!!!

The Fujitsu version of the 4416 (16K X 4) DRAM as qualified under Atari
part number 137323-001 will not work in a board with a RAS/CAS generator
designed like the one on Crystal Castles. The CAS HIGH to RAS LOW delay 
time on both the TI and INMOS parts is specified as 0ns, while the Fujitsu
part needs 30ns for the 150ns version. On Crystal Castles, the CAS signal
clears an S74 to generate the leading edge of RAS. No way can it work.
I have asked that Fujitsu be disqualified for 137323-001.

This response is threefold:

    The event at the Red Lion Inn (on Brokaw) is NOT a
"survivor's party."  Everyone is invited to attend.

    The official management viewpoint of the occasion is
not specified.  I (the sender) do not represent company
management on this.  I personally believe they are looking
the other way.  While they cannot encourage this event,
they do not discourage it.

    Last but not least, my name is not Owen.  I have been
asked to pass on the message because nobody wanted to take
credit (answer all the questions) for authorship.  Me either.

John,
	I realize that you are probably busy right now, but I have discovered
something that I think you should know about. This information came from
Sophie. She and her husband are the couple who actually run the cafeteria.
I have no way of verifying the following information, but if it is true,
then it is a serious matter.
----------------------------------------------------
	Tony Dietz worked out a real sweetheart deal for providing us
with a cafeteria.

	It seems that Atari pays Have-A-Snack money so we can have a
cafeteria. However, Have-A-Snack does not itself provide this service.
A company called Super-Snack does and PAYS HAVE-A-SNACK FOR THE PRIVILEGE.

	The couple who run it (Super-Snack) paid Have-A-Snack $60K 
(not refundable) plus pay a percentage of the gross. In return Super-Snack 
receives nothing from Have-A-Snack.

 	Sophie (of the above couple) described to me how Have-A-Snack
got her to sign the contract. They insisted that she sign it right then
and there or else forget about it. She was not given the opportunity
to have an attorney read and explain it to her and since English is
not her native language she could not understand it by herself.

	She is afraid to complain because Have-A-Snack has threatened
to kick her out without notice (keeping the $60K) if she says anything. 
---------------------------------------------------------
	If this stuff is true, I believe it may come under the Federal
Anti-Racketeering Laws, especially if, as I suspect, Tony Dietz has
some kind of "special relationship" with Have-A-Snack.

	Is there some way that you can quietly check it out? I don't
want to get Sophie in trouble.  

	Thanks.

Skip,

	I know I speak for myself when I say how sorry I am that you will no
longer be working with Coin-Op.  You brought good, positive attitudes to
Coin op.. something I fear we are in BAD need of now. It was nice to see upper
management really get excited about what we do and who we are. I know that you
hate Bally as much as I do and that they hate you too. (that's good.) You showed
how much you believe in Coin-Op's future and you seemed willing to do glorious
battle for it. I hope that the "new" Coin Op can keep your attitudes.

				thank you sir..

	The couple who run it (Super-Snack) paid Have-A-Snack $60K 
(not refundable) plus pay a percentage of the gross. In return Super-Snack 
receives nothing from Have-A-Snack.

 	Sophie (of the above couple) described to me how Have-A-Snack
got her to sign the contract. They insisted that she sign it right then
and there or else forget about it. She was not given the opportunity
to have an attorney read and explain it to her and since English is
not her native language she could not understand it by herself.

	She is afraid to complain because Have-A-Snack has threatened
to kick her out without notice (keeping the $60K) if she says anything. 
-----------------------------------------------------------
	If this stuff is true, I believe it may come under the Federal
Anti-Racketeering Laws, especially if, as I suspect, Tony Dietz has
some kind of "special relationship" with Have-A-Snack.

	Is there some way that you can quietly check it out? I don't
want to get Sophie in trouble.  

	Thanks.

Subj:	new boot eprom for applied microsystems emulator


To all using the Applied Microsystems Emulator.

I have a new boot eprom for it, i haven't found out what it fixes yet but
I will do soon.

If you come to my office, (old old common area, near starfighter lab) I'll
give you a prom to install.

Someone out there also has the piece of paper that tells us where to put the
prom, so if they can get that to me i'll copy it.

Subj:	letters from the lovelorn


Dear Abby:
	Now that some of the smoke has cleared from the last reorganization,
I have a few thoughts about it that I would like to get some feedback on.
	To start off, I must confess that business and economics was not one
of my strong points in college so I may be totally off base here, but I'm
wondering if it would have been possible to come right out and tell everyone
that there were going to be some layoffs of XX% and the reason for them was 
blah blah blah, and give out the information that was presented on tuesday
to the remaining Atarians to everyone before the layoffs happened.  The
way rumors were floating around all week, everyone knew it was going to happen
so why couldn't we be told why it had to happen before the ax fell?  Was some
of the information company confidential so that soon to be x-Atarians couldn't
know them?  If that was the case then that sensitive information could have
been left out, but is knowing how much it costs Atari to stay in business
and how much the company profits are projected to be and the fact that our
expenses are higher that our revenues, is knowing any of these things
detrimental to the company?
	I was told there was a meeting for all the people that were laid off
on friday morning. If there was, I obviously didn't hear what was said, but
couldn't everyone been given that information on monday or when ever it was
decided that the layoff had to happen instead of letting the rumors start?
	I was also told that on the day before the layoffs there were some 
security problems (I assume that means that some equipment had grown legs and 
was walking out of the building). Could some of this been avoided if people 
knew why the layoff had to happen?  It seems real easy to take being laid off 
very personally, i.e. the company doesn't like me, the company doesn't 
appreciate me, the company doesn't think I'm competent, and what follows is 
people getting angry and wanting revenge, i.e. well I don't deserve being 
treated this way so I'm gonna do something just to get even because if they 
can screw me then I can screw them.  But after seeing the way the numbers add 
up, or should I say don't add up, it's obvious that it was a business move and 
not a personal attack.
	I hope this doesn't sound like I think I could have handled it better
and come next election vote for me because I'll put a terminal in every office,
legalize marijuana and build a swimming pool & softball field in the back forty
because I wouldn't take the job if they paid me. I just want to know if stuff 
like this only happens when the planets line up and the tooth fairy gets a 
fortune cookie that reads "you will meet someone as gay as you are" or can it 
happen in the real world or why it wouldn't work in fairy land or here or the 
real world or what thoughts you have about anything that would help me 
understand this crazy business of paying people to make stuff and then trying 
to sell the same stuff to someone else for more than what it cost to make.

    Greetings, hackers!

    A new utility has been created, called DISASM.
It is a general-purpose disassembler for 8 bit micros
(up to 16 bit address space).  It supports several
processors currently, and more are expected shortly.
It also DOESN't support several processors; as I said,
it deals with micros with byte opcodes.  It does not
do the 68000, and probably never will...that will probably
be a different program.

    To use it, do a $RESTART (to get the symbol) and
then $DISASM gets you in.  There is documentation in DOK:
which is also online with the HELP command.  There are a
number of improvements that could be made to the disassembler,
and I need some feedback to let me know which ones are of
value to you guys.  When (if {ha ha}) you find bugs, let me
know & I will fix them as fast as I can.  Enhancements will
be essentially by popular demand.  Enjoy!

Subj:	SYSTEM USAGE ON KIM....F.Y.I.


   For those who have an interest or concern regarding system usage or 
response time on KIM, the following info may be of some use to you:
   1. Up until approximately 9:00 am each weekday, KIM is sitting in a "NULL"
      state waiting for work approximately 99% of the time.
   2. Between the hours of 9:00 am and 10:30 am, KIM is sitting in a "NULL"
      state approximately 95% of the time.
   3. From 10:30 am until noon, KIM utilization builds up to about 50%.
   4. From nnon til about 5:00 pm, KIM is pretty much busy full time.
   5. From 5:00 pm til 7:00 pm utilization again rapidly drops off to about 50%.   
   6. From 7:00 pm onward, utilization seems to vary somewhat, but in general,
      by 9:00 pm, KIM is again sitting in a "NULL" state 90 to 100% of the time.
   These are my observations over the past two weeks. They may or may not be
typical of the past or future, but you may find them of some use, especially
if you have concerns or problems with respsonse time during your current
working hours.  As I said,.....F.Y.I.

    Hi again (fellow) hackers!

    As some of you are so quick to point out, I have a caustic sense
of humor concerning failure of the HELP facility in DISASM.  Sorry
about that.  For those of you who are still curious after having had
your fingers slapped, it should work now.  I have found the cause of
the problem, and I am working on it for the long term.  For the short
term (no jokes about the semester being up already) there is a bandaid
patch in the logical name tables.  For those of you who are nozy enough
to chase down the image, don't plan on it being there forever, cuz it's
gonna move ($DISASM will still work, but $MCR DISASM will soon also
work).

    Thats all for now (till the next dozen bug reports...)

Subj:	Bar Games and Passive Brainstorming


Greetings and Salutations!

I have decided to try and use the junk mail list for possibly
constructive activity, such as a passive brainstorming session about the
new games market that seems to be virtually untapped and waiting for
someone to do just that.  The market being referred to is "Bar-Games". 

To start the session off, I would like to present some of my analysis of
the market place, existing games in that market, features that the games
should have or not have, and some possible game ideas.  Hopefully this
will help trigger your imagination and you will share these ideas with
your co-workers and myself by using the mail system (@sys$mail:junk).
Even if you might be responding to just one person's comments you should
send the response to all so that we might share your ideas and comments.
Afterall, that's what brainstorming is all about. 


THE MARKET PLACE

Local neighborhood bars where people get together to socialize is as yet
an untapped market.  These bars are not of the same nature as the bars
that are located in this area (and south) in that they are predominately
centers of social interaction.  They tend to be of a more quiet nature,
except for some of their patrons.  The patrons are not into playing
games, especially video type, but do play some games as part of their
socializing.  They go to these establishments to watch television to see
major sporting events or just visiting friends.  They are definitely
casual game players. 

The games are sometimes owned by the establishment and sometimes handled
by an operator.  It is possible that we may have two product lines, one
for sale to the owner of the establishment which may or may not have a
coin mechanism, and the other more traditional variety (for us) to be
sold to and handled by an operator. 

Games that are sold to the establishment owner would have to be very 
reasonably priced and be very reliable.  A more expensive game might 
also be sold but would have to last a very long time.  i.e., such as a 
pool table.

One approach to non-coin games might be to sell them to breweries or 
liquor manufacturers with, of course, their product names all over them 
which they might give or sell to the establishments in a similar fashion 
to beer signs.


THE EXISTING GAMES

The patrons of these bars do play such games as pool, shuffleboard,
dice, cards, darts, etc. These games have certain properties that I feel
must be in our bar-games if we are to be successful in this marketplace.

Some of the features that these games have are as follows:

1.  There is no time limit associated with the game.  That is, each
player has an unlimited amount of time to setup at each turn.

2.  They are multi-player games that may be played by a single player, 
but are more "fun" with two or more players.

3.  Each player has a turn.  That is, they don't play simultaneously.

4.  In some of the games, a player must make use of what is leftover 
from the previous player's turn.  This adds a strategy to the game.  
Unlike our existing games where each player has their own playfield 
results or starts fresh with a new set of circumstances whether or not 
there is another player in the game.

5.  They are competition games, i.e., not cooperative.  Individuals 
competing against each other.

6.  A player is NEVER competing against the machine.  The machine is the 
mechanism by which a player either competes with himself or with other 
individuals.

7.  There is an element of chance in the game.  Skill is not the only 
factor.

8.  Fast eye-hand coordination is not a factor.

9.  The games are relatively noise free.  Sound is not a big factor.

10.  They are not involved strategy games.  The strategies involved are 
fairly simple and straight forward.  They are definitely not head games.

11.  To play most of the games the players must physically move to the 
game itself.  The games are not physically located where the people sit 
to drink and converse.  This would eliminate the concepts of a cocktail 
table or a bar top unit.  The games that are played where the patrons 
sit are very small physically, i.e., dice or cards.



OUR GAMES

1.  The type of games that should not be done are those that try to
duplicate any of the existing games, i.e., a video pool game. 

2.  The game should provide activities that can't be done with the
existing games, i.e., Anti-gravity.  The game could be similar, but must
be different. 

3.  There should be an element of chance to the game.  This would allow
less skilled players to compete in a reasonable fashion. 

4.  The type of controls that the game uses should be simple and
straight-forward to operate.  The use of joysticks should be eliminated
from consideration as they seem to represent the arcade style of games
and that would put-off the players we are trying to reach.  The controls
should be limited to buttons, whirly-gig, trackball, and/or a
spring-loaded lever type. 

5.  Video games could easily be done with an 800 chip set. 
High-resolution graphics and sophisticated sounds are not necessary nor
are they desired by the players.  Lower resolution CRTs could be used
helping to keep cost down. 

6.  Kinetic games should not be too large or noisy.  They should make
use of lights for attraction and for game play. 

7.  Light type games, ala wall-games, might be made smaller and use LEDs
as opposed to incandescent lamps.  Back-lit graphics should be kept
simple and minimal. 

8.  Video and kinetic type games would probably have to be in
stand-alone type cabinets providing areas in or on the cabinet for
placing drinks and have a place for ashtrays. 

9.  Behind-the-bar type games would have to be light type (a form of
wall-games) that are fairly small and simple with probably no audio or
very little. 



GAME IDEAS

1.  Arithma-cubes - a dice game

This could easily be a wall-game or a video game.

There are four (4) dice used.  The players decide whether the highest or 
the lowest score wins.  There are foUr math functions that must be used 
add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  Each "throw" of the dice the 
player must use one of the die numbers and one of the math functions of 
their  choice.  Each of the math functions may only be used once.  The 
game is over after each player has had five (5) "throws" of the dice.

The player must pick a starting number out of their first throw.
Thereafter the picked number must be used in conjunction with a selected
math function that operates on the first or the previous result for that
player.  After the last player has used their last math function, the
game is over and the winner declared. 

During the game each players score might be graphically as well as
numerically displayed.  This would give the players visual feedback as 
to the relative standings of each player during the game.

The game should be able to handle a minimum of four (4) players.


2.  Game #2 - This is where your ideas start!

Subj:	good-bye


To all the wonderful people at Atari:

	I'd like to say to everyone that I have, on the whole, found
my stay here to be fun.  But more than this, all the people at Atari
are the kind that I can say I've been proud to associate with.

	We have a lot of talent here, still.  Although some real lights
were lost in the last re-organization there is enough here to continue
creating exciting games.

	I regret that as the game market has changed, Atari's most 
innovative concepts have only been seen within company walls.  We have
not been able to successfully market many of the best ideas in entertainment
that I have seen developed here.

	Part of this is due to the arcade and street market conditions.
Some is due to the drag which consumer and home computer had put on Atari's
continued operations.  Much, I fear, has been due to the lack of consensus
and common goals.

	I leave Atari to pursue my goals elsewhere.  Those goals are the
same ones I came here with:  to develop a real-time animation development
system for character animation of a high quality.  Of course, I have
realized that many skills go into any development project and have branched
off into 3-d design like I, Robot and Last Starfighter as a subset of the
problem that I have decided to tackle.

	My vision of the future of Atari is not compatible with those goals,
at least not in the 1 to 2 year near future.  The greatest lesson I have 
learned here is to DO IT NOW , or don't do it at all.  Time after time I 
have prepared for a project and planned all the great things that could be
accomplished, only to have corporate re-structuring eliminate the resources
necessary to acheive success.

	My advice to you is: DO IT NOW!  Whatever dream you have of a better
future for yourself personally, or the Company as a whole, the time is now.

	Yours truly,

					Barry A. Whitebook

Subj:	new and improved DISASM


    There is a new release of DISASM out on Kim.  I will put it
on the other nodes when there is either someone who complains
or some stability in the program (don't hold your breath here).


New Features:

    DISASM now understands the 65C02 (CMOS 6502, ala MAC65C).

    The HELP file has been enhanced a great deal (and also the
DOC file since it comes from the same place, cuz I'm lazy).

    The HELP file is now looked for in the place where it belongs
and is, so it won't throw up on you or call you nasty names when
you talk nice to DISASM.

    There is a SHOW VALID CPUs command, which tells you which
opcode processors have been linked in to that image.  That way
when it starts getting too big and we have to split it into parts,
it won't take long.  Also, new CPUs can be added quicker this way.
It will also help you find the one you want (and know what to call
it).

    There are 2 new modes, CONSTANTS and GLOBALS, created to
suppress (if you want) the part in front of the generated source code
which defines all the byte and word CONSTANTS with equates, and
GLOBALizes all the referenced labels.  NB:  It is possible to refer
to a label and not have a definition for it (if it falls in the
middle of a multi-byte opcode).


NEW BUGS:

    Let me know!


Old bugs (I know, I'm working on them):

    CPU'S should require the name be fully spelled out (no 
abbreviations), to avoid potential confusion from ambiguity
(SET CPU 65 is obvious, no?  but which one will you get NOW?)

    There should be some kind of SHOW MODE command

    ASCII, ASCIZ, ASCIN, AI, AZ, AN commands, BYTE, WORD too.

    It should remember how you last showed a location (once ASCII & co
are working) and use that mode when it writes the source file.

    It would be convenient if it knew about other kinds of files
besides .ROM and .LDA.  For now, if it isn't one of these, use MIXIT
and fixit.

Subj:	Two more Bar Games for your comments


The Fishing Games for Bars

Video Game

This is a casting game that involves a joystick type control except that 
it has two encoder wheels for two way rotation.  The control revolves 
around a shaft out of the side with a button activated by the thumb.  
I'm not sure what to do for right or left handed players.  The control 
also has a 30-45 degree left-right movement for lateral casting control.

The idea is to cast a fly rod, with fly, at rising fish.  If the player 
manages to get close enough to a rising fish then the fish takes the 
bait and the player receives points based upon the size of the fish.  
The size of the fish can most often be determined by the player by the 
amount of splash that the rising fish make.  The larger fish will tend 
to make a smaller amount of water disturbance.  Some of the fish will 
jump completely out of the water, others might just show their dorsal 
fin.

The target area might be indicated by the maximum size of the water 
rings generated by the rising fish, i.e., the larger fish making the 
smaller disturbance would be a more difficult target and thereby being 
worth more points.

Losing the hook, i.e., by snagging something or losing the fish loses
the player a life.  A bad cast might catch a fish anyway if the cast at
least reaches the minimum target.  A cast that is released on the
backward swing will always foul on a tree, bush, rock or maybe, just
fall to the water behind, i.e., it's random, but most likely it will
cost the player a hook.  A bad forward cast (too short) will cause the
player to catch a CARP that will cost the player points.  A cast that is
too long might catch a minnow (or a Bluegill) and be worth very little. 
Or maybe the bad cast is recoverable and the player tries it again. 

The fishing could be done on a lake environment or a stream for making 
the targets more difficult, i.e., fish are in pocket water.

The fishing could be for bass which would involve snags and targets of a 
more difficult nature.

The type of fishing could be selected by the players at the start of the 
game or during the attract mode.

The game is over when a number of fish have been caught, or when the
hooks are all lost, or ... 


Mechanical Game

This is a fish landing game that uses a feed-back joystick, but has no 
video.  Instead the game uses back-lit fish pictures or images and a 
string of LEDs for feed-back to the player and audience.

The feed-back joystick is the rod which has a thumb controlled release 
button for the cast.  The cast is really a start the rotating selection 
of the type of fish being caught.  The amount of forward speed the 
player puts on the control determines the rate of cycling the selection 
arrow goes through before coming to rest on the selection.  The player 
does not really make the selection, but affects the selection process.

The selection of fish might be Marlin, Shark, Salmon, Trout, Bass,
Bluegill, Minnow, and definitely a CARP (catching the CARP might cost
the player points or some penalty).  Each will have a different point
value, length of fight, and force of fight. 

There will be a string of LEDs that will reflect the force of the cast, 
and the force of the fish's tug on the pole.

The player will get 3-5 fish per game.  The play is started by a player
gripping the control and depressing the button with the thumb.  Forward
movement of the control and the release of the button will start the
selection cycling of the lights behind the selection arrows to the left
of the set of fish pictures or images.  The selection cycling will slow
down of its own accord and rest on the selected fish.  The selected fish
is worth a number of points scaled to reflect the size of the fish being
represented.  A Marlin might be worth 1000 points and a minnow 100.  The
selected fish will be hooked and begin fighting the pole.  The player
must try to keep the pole as centered as possible so as not to let it
contact the ring switch.  If the front or sides of the ring switch makes
contact with the pole the fish gets away and it is the next players
turn.  If the back of the ring switch (i.e., the stick is pulled all the 
way back) makes contact with the pole, there will be a delay before the 
fish gets away.  This will allow the player to pull all the way back, 
momentarily, on the control without losing the fish, but if held back 
too long the fish is lost.

Each fish will fight for a predetermined amount of time.  The time will
vary depending upon the size of the fish.  The fish will be considered
landed if the player maintains control for this time duration.  The
points awarded for the fish will be determined by the length of time
that the player plays the fish.  The player receives points up to the
maximum for the size fish selected and possibly bonus points for landing
it.  If the player loses the fish (the pole makes contact with the ring
switch) before the fish is done fighting, the player is awarded the
points earned up to that time.  The length of time, points earned and
bonus at landing are determined by the size of the fish that was
selected on the cast.  Then the next player gets a turn.

While the fish is being played by the player the string of LEDs should 
light in a series to reflect the amount of pull the player is fighting 
to provide the player and onlookers with control feed-back.  The harder 
the pull by the fish causes more LEDs to be turned on.  This will 
provide for the player and the audience a visual indication as to what 
is happening with the control.

This game should be a 1-4 player game.  This will require 4 sets of 8 
segment displays for scores.  The rest of the needed indications for the 
players will be done in back-lit graphics, such as, who's turn, fish 
lost, and any other needed messages.

Subj:	More about DISASM...


    There is a new release of DISASM out on Kim.  It still is just on Kim.


New Features:

    The HELP and DOC files have been enhanced to show the other improvements.
Unless future changes affect the HELP or DOC files directly, this can be
assumed in the future.

    The 6809 processor is supported.  It uses MAC69 syntax.  The addressing
modes are not all explicit, so there may be ambiguities in the resultant
source code.  As far as I know, this is the last 8 bit (as measured by opcode
fetch) processor that will be added to DISASM.

	    Incidentally, for those of you who are interested, there
	exists a PDP-11 disassembler which was obtained from DECUS. 
	See Dave Shepperd or me for details.  There currently is no
	other 16 bit CPUs set up, nor 32 bit. 

    There is a RESET command to restore the operating modes to the startup
or default conditions.  This includes radix and verify, but does not include
current CPU setting or user memory contents (a READ file stays READ).

    There is a SHOW MODES command to find out what the current (or default)
mode settings are.  It also shows what CPU you are set up with.

    It now understands .HEX files and .DLD, in addition to the .LDA, .ROM, and
image files that it used to.


NEW BUGS:

    There was a documentation error concerning DUMP mode.  As this applies
only to debugging the expression evaluator, I hereby express doubts that
the error expressed any significance.  In any case, it was fixed.

    If you find any, let me know!


Used bugs:

    CPU'S should still require the name be fully spelled out.

    ASCII, ASCIZ, ASCIN, AI, AZ, AN commands, BYTE, WORD too.

    It should remember how you last showed a location (once ASCII & co
are working) and use that mode when it writes the source file.

Subj:	C Cross-reference Utility


NOTICE TO ALL "C" PROGRAMMERS

I have just recently placed a C cross-reference program into 
SYS$SYSDEVICE:[GENERAL], called CXREF.

CXREF accepts a C source file as its input and puts out a ".CRF" file 
which contains a line numbered copy of the source and a cross-reference 
of all strings, literals, numeric constants, and symbols.  C reserved 
words and comments are ignored.

Strings are anything between a " and a ", i.e., "this is a string".

Literals are anything between a ' and a ', i.e., '0' is a literal.

Numeric constants are numbers.  i.e., 32 is listed from array[32];.

Symbols are seperated into two types, those whose first letter is 
uppercase and those that start with a lowercase letter.  These are 
listed under the headings:

--------------------|
SYMBOLS (UC)        |      for those starting with an uppercase
--------------------|

--------------------|
SYMBOLS (LC):       |      for those starting with a lowercase
--------------------|

The default extension for the input file is ".C"

By defining a word to run CXREF, one can use that word with an input 
filename to obtain a cross-reference listing.
EXAMPLE:

	WORD :== $ SYS$SYSDEVICE:[GENERAL]CXREF

        or

	WORD :== $ DOK:CXREF

To obtain a cross-reference:

	WORD FILENAME        (if FILENAME is a .C file extension)

This will input FILENAME.C and output FILENAME.CRF

or one could use:

	WORD FILENAME NEWNAME.EXT

and this would input FILENAME.C and output NEWNAME.EXT

Anyway, it is there for those who may find it useful and for those who 
won't, don't.  If you experience any difficulties let me know.  As if 
you wouldn't.

Subj:	The Proposed Regulator/Audio III


The Proposed Regulator/Audio III		Jed Margolin 10/5/84

The least expensive Audio/Regulator board for the Not-Budget Systemi (only) 
would be:
		+5 VDC @ 10 A
		+12 VDC @ 0.1 A
		-12 VDC @ 0.1 A
	
Two audio channels, nominally 3.7 Watts each, into 4 Ohms, using TDA 2002's 
connected to the +12 VDC output.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Audio/Regulator board that could be used with either the Not-Budget 
Systemi or the Road Runner game system would be capable of:
		
		+5 VDC @ 10 A
		+15 VDC @ 0.4 A
		-15 VDC @ 0.4 A

It would have two audio channels, nominally 10 Watts each, into 4 Ohms, using 
TDA 2030's connected to the +22 VDC output. It would cost about $2.00 more 
than one for the Not-Budget Systemi only. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This same Audio/Regulator board might be used for the Paper Boy project 
(apparently as part of some kind of backup scheme).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please send your comments to [Margolin].
Amplifier and Speaker Calculations:

For a single ended supply of voltage VS, the peak to peak voltage
will be VS minus some slop in the amplifier. Use 1 volt.
	Vp-p = VS - 1			
Therefore: Vp = (VS-1)/2	   
For Sine Wave Vrms = (VS-1)/2*0.7071

Power = Vrms*Vrms/R
      = ((VS-1)/2*0.7071)**2/R

Since POWER = I*I*R, I = SQRT(P/R)
Because it is single ended the effective current is half,
so for each channel I = SQRT(P/R)/2



	VS			 R(Speaker)	Power		   Current 	      Amplifier Type
	(V)			  (Ohms)     (/Channel)	 	1 CH / 2 CH
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	10.3 (unreg)		    4		2.7 W		0.41 A  / 0.82 A	TDA 2002

2.	12 (reg)		    4		3.7 W		0.48 A	/ 0.96 A	TDA 2002

	26 (unreg, high line)	    8		9.7 W		0.55 A	/ 1.10 A 	TDA 2030

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not-Budget Systemi current requirements for  +12 VDC and -12 VDC:

For a TI TMS-5220 + a bunch of LM324's a realistic figure is +12 VDC @ 60 ma 
and -12 VDC @ 95 ma. [The TMS-5220 requires 35 ma from -5 VDC. The +5 VDC comes
from the +5 VDC logic, not the +12 VDC. Allowing 10 ma per LM324 package * 6 
packages = 60 ma. That is 24 op-amps which should be sufficient.]

The Audio they are referring to is the Audio Output Amplifiers that this 
is to help select.

The game board requirements should be satisfied by +12 VDC @ 100 ma and 
-12 VDC @ 100 ma.

(They could probably use +12 VDC and -5 VDC or +15 VDC and -15 VDC instead).
(If they are really using LM324's, they shouldn't. They should use TL084's.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Road Runner game requires +5 VDC @ 7.5 A, +15 VDC @ 0.4 A, and 
-15 VDC @ 0.4 A.		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The audio output amplifiers cannot be powered from the +10.3 VDC because it 
is already overloaded by the +5 VDC Regulator.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 7812 is good for about 1.5 Amps.

The 7815 is also good for about 1.5 Amps.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The +22 VDC output is rated at 1.5 A and the -22 VDC output is rated at 1 A. 
Since they come from the same transformer winding, the current available 
from +22 VDC is increased as the current drawn from -22 VDC is decreased.

+22 VDC actually ranges from +18 at low line to +26 VDC at high line.
-22 VDC actually ranges from -18 at low line to -26 VDC at high line.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The maximumn undistorted output level for the TDA 2030 is 10 Watts for 
4 Ohm loads and about 9 Watts for 8 Ohm loads.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subj:	An Audio Commentary


	Most people don't realize how loud arcade environments really are. The
ear is a very forgiving organ. On a Saturday night typical arcade 'ambient'
noise levels can reach 80 -> 90 dB-A. Ambient noise in this case refers to
people talking (and screaming to be heard over the other noise), all the sound
competing games, and the usual noise in any large room (air conditioning,
fluorescent lamps, street noise etc... none of which you can hear anyway
because of all the other noise!). Sounds produced from specific game cabinets,
at the players head, can reach 106 dB-A. Add all this 'noise' and you have a
very serious problem of noise pollution. 

	The Department of Industrial Relations of the State of California
enacted in 1962 a Noise Control Safety Order for shops, which reads as follows:

	"If an employee is exposed to noise for five or more hours per normal
workday, the level shown in [the following table] are the levels at and above
which the wearing of hearing protectors is mandatory. For employees whose
exposure to occupational noise is less than five hours per day (this would be
an arcade... unless you are a devout arcadian!), the noise level may be 3 dB
higher for each halving of the exposure time, e.g., for an exposure of 2.5
hours, the noise level encountered may be 3 dB higher in all frequency ranges
than the values shown in [the table]." 


			American Standards		Octage Band
			Preferred Frequencies		Sound Pressure Level
Frequency Band		for Acoustical			   dB
    Hz			Measurements (Hz)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20   -    75		  63				110
75   -   150		 125				102
150  -   300		 250				 97
300  -   600		 500				 95
600  -  1200		1000				 95
1200 -  2400		2000				 95
2400 -  4800		4000				 95
4800 - 10000		8000				 95

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Department of Labor specifications indicates a maximum permissible noise
level of 95 dB-A for 4 hours and a 100 dB-A level for 2 hours without hearing
protectors. There are additional guidelines for other environments such as
hospitals, restaurants, fairs etc. , all of which have about the same specs.
I know of no guidelines for the arcade, but it is very possible there is. 

	I'm very concerned with noise pollution. I've expressed my views many
times to John Ray and he was very receptive to my concerns. He had the typical
reaction to any problem that you can't personally control - 'What are you going
to do? We can't dictate to the operators how loud to turn up the game sound'.
He was absolutely right. We certainly can't put out a game that limits the
level of sound that is delivered to the player. Put it next to a Spy Hunter and
you will never hear the game. On the other hand we can control how we present
the sound to the player and thus begin to lower the ambient noise in an arcade.

	There are several ways of presenting the sound to the player and at the
same time lower the ambient noise of the arcade. First we must have crystal
clear sound. If our audio is relatively clean of digital noise and produces
crisp clean sound, then our games will be noticed and enjoyed in the presence
of other games that are full of distortion. Clean sound will cut through the
arcade noise and will present our games to the public how we hear and developed
them in our labs. 
 	Our cabinets must also acoustically involve the player(s) only and not
the rest of the arcade. Very little sound should mix with the ambient noise of
the arcade. I am not advocating the limitation of audio into the arcade
environment. First, this would be impossible without a lot of work and money.
Second, it would be detrimental to us since one of the 'hooks' that draw people
to our games is the sound. However, involving the player within this acoustic
umbrella will enhance the game, involve the player at a more emotional level
and at the same time cut down the noise pollution in the arcade. 
	If we educate the operator, perhaps by way of a chapter in the game
manual, as to this problem we will be on our way to the elimination of the
problem. We need to inform the operator that competing sounds, such as his
stereo, will only interfere with the player's audio feedback from the game,
reducing the player's enjoyment and which will eventually cut into the
operator's profits. We should also suggest ways of setting up arcade cabinets
in his environment to maximize acoustic seperation between games. Lastly we
should strongly point out our commitment to music in our games and make it
apparent that the music, sound effects and voice are an integral part of the
game experience. 
 
	If we set a precedent in the area of audio by 1) producing clean audio
electronics, 2) designing superior delivery systems, 3) establishing our
commitment of the intergration of music, video and game play and 4) presenting
our concerns and our willingness to help about noise pollution, then we will be
ahead of the competition and stay there.

Subj:	Hacker's Heaven


    Hi hackers!

    For those of you who use the MAKE utility written by Landon Dyer,
there is a new "utility" named PREMAKE.  It takes one argument, which
it will prompt for, which is the name of an included file.  PREMAKE's
function is to search *.MAC files for ".INCLU" (minimum for a .INCLUDE
directive) or ".COPY" and the name of a file which has just been changed
(the included file).  For all .MAC files containing these strings, the
current date is changed to "now" by copying the file on top of itself.
MAKE will sense this as a change, and the next time you MAKE your program,
the files so tagged by PREMAKE will automatically be assembled.

    PREMAKE has limitations.  Because it must physically examine the file
(twice) to check for inclusion, it is not reasonable (in terms of CPU time
and hence operator wait time) to give PREMAKE the name of a file and have
it un-nest all those files in which it is included (every time it found
a match, it would have to start all over again, looking for INCLUDEs or
COPYs for the file it just tagged).  To get around this, PREMAKE spits
out the name of all the files referring to the file recently modifed
(the included file).  It is up to you to realize that some of these files
are NOT highest level files and to do a premake with them, yourself.

    PREMAKE only checks *.MAC; files in the current directory.  This is
cuz your interdependencies are not expected to go outside any specific
directory, and it is annoying to have to type "[]*.MAC;" every time
you wanna use it.  If anyone can justify a reason to make the searched
filespec different, or variable, send mail to this address.

Subj:	Oh sheet, mon


We're in the process of getting a spreadsheet for the VAX. There's two in
contention for our hard earned dollars, so the writers have allowed us a
trial run of their product for about 30 days. The first of the two, FLOW_CALC
has arrived and is now installed on Kim. The documentation that accompanied
this product sucks. There is barely a paragraph on each command and no examples
at all in it. I guess that they assume you'll use the online help stuff which
there is an awful lot of to get you out of trouble. There are two demo programs
with it, FCINTRO and FCTUTOR which you can run on a VT100 or CIT-101. FCTUTOR
is very good, I think you'll get a kick out of it. Please send comments to this
address. The next time you login or RESTART you can type:

	$ FCTUTOR	!to run the tutorial
	$ FCINTRO	!to run the introduction
	$ FCALC your_file !to make your own sheet	

Have fun.

Subj:	The hell of hacking ... or, the subcellar of Hacker's Heaven


		    This missive is dedicated to (and
		done in) the style of Jeff Boscole, who,
		dedicated or not, was done in, in
		inimicable style. 

    There has been a fair amount of debate about the PREMAKE utility.
I am seriously considering a veterinarian to eliminate the planarians.

    MAKE was originally a UNIX utility, used to conditionally build
programs from their component parts, if (and only if) any one or more
of the parts was newer (more recently changed) than the "target".
Definitionwise, the TARGET is the unit currently being built, and it
DEPENDS on those units (files) which are inputs to the program doing
the build (compiler, assembler or linker).  The target of one step is
quite possibly depended upon in subsequent steps in the build of a
particular program.  This is indeed the case with current workings of
68000 "C" development.  The executable binary is dependent on one or
more object modules, each of which is dependent on one or more assembly
language sources, each of which is dependent on one or more compiler
sources.

    As you can see from the not-quite-nonsense spouted so far, MAKE as
originally conceived is not intuitively obvious in function, when the
details are known.  It is intended to be fed an input file, called a
makefile, which is a list of the dependencies to be resolved, and the
command text neccesary to resolve each.

    There is an infinite number of applications for the Unix version of
MAKE.  It was designed for a system with several potential sources for
a given module, and several layers of dependencies for a specific utility.
I am not prepared to describe nor debate the use or usefullness of MAKE;
I do feel compelled to point out that it is a convenience tool; a simple
command file (in fact, simpler than the corresponding makefile in every case)
can rebuild the desired end module unconditionally.  The primary advantage
of MAKE is in the elimination of CPU time that can be pinpointed as non
essential, and hence user time in waiting for the processes that are not
entirely neccesary.  In our own case, this would reduce the load on the
VAX a tiny bit.

    Landon Dyer's incarnation of MAKE assumed MACxx development, and I
cannot say for certain, but I expect it was MAC65 only.

    There is also a version written in C by Eddie Babcock.  I don't know
a whole lot about it either, but since Landon's was written in DCL, Eddie's
will have the advantage of speed at least, and probably quite a bit of utility
as well.

    The whole purpose of PREMAKE was to allow users of MAKE to cheat.  There
are header files for virtually every sizable project, containing such
information as copyright notices, authorship, identity, and documentation,
which matter not a whit to the execution of the program in which they are
included.  Yet for all the same reasons as these, they must be included in
each and every module at the source level.  Global options, such as debugging
flags, are also included here, to make the unit easier to develop.  Here is
the problem with mixing these non-code items (which are subject to change
due to many sources, legal, managerial, and financial, not to mention
whimsical) and developmental stuff you put there BECAUSE you intend to
change it:  unless the changes will directly affect the function of a
module in which they are included, you don't really want to reassemble (or
whatever) the source unless and until you are ready to release.  There is
no way that the computer can know and/or correlate all of these things.
Look how much fun you had, and you KNOW how the system works!

    So, in order to reduce the time between iterative versions (hackings)
{RE-CURSE:  1) See recurse.  2) What happens when you rehurt yourself.}
you can cheat.  Avoid non-essential compiles / assemblies with MAKE.
Avoid redundant assemblies by eliminating non-code header file dependencies.
When such a header file will cause an effect in the generated code, use
PREMAKE to search for the inclusion directives and renew the date on the
source module, forcing MAKE to recognise the change.

    To reduce the clamor for change in PREMAKE, it has been changed.
PREMAKE is implemented as a DCL command file, and is now used with three
parameters:  the file type of the sources, the required text of the
inclusion directive, and the filespec that has changed, and requires
recompilation.  For the MACXX assemblers, which is assumed to be the
majority case, PREMAKE is defined at login time as:
    PREMAKE :== @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]PREMAKE .MAC .INCLU
    	... and you use it as $ PREMAKE HEADER or $PREMAKE HEADER.MAC
if HEADER.MAC is the file with the changes.  For C programmers, you
can either redefine PREMAKE or invent you own word as in:
    PREMAKE :== @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]PREMAKE .C #INCLUDE
    	... and the default extension will be .C;  PREMAKE will search
"*.C;" for #INCLUDE and your filename on the same line.  If your filename
is a .C file, the extension needn't be specified to be recognised.

    Of course, anything costs.  Because of making it general for languages,
the second search was eliminated.  It used to search for .COPY as well as
.INCLU (.INCLU is all you need for .INCLUDE to be recognised), but now it
does only the .INCLU directive.  If you want to search for .COPY, you will
have to define your own word, and do it as well as PREMAKE. It still does
not nest.  PREMAKE still only checks *.MAC; files in the current directory.

    As usual, if you or any of your operatives should get burned, I will
disavow any responsibility for my actions.  Bug reports should be sent to
this address.

The other spreadsheet that I mentioned the other day has been installed. Its
called Graphic Outlook and can be started with:

	$ GRO your_filename

There's a couple of demo packages that you can run to see how it works:

	$ GRO/COM=GRLOOKDIR:GRAPHMW	!graphics on a VT125
	$ GRO/COM=GRLOOKDIR:LOWRESGR	!graphics on a VT100 (or CIT101)
	$ GRO/COM=GRLOOKDIR:ITRATE	!iteration to a goal demo

In order to display graphics, they recommend that your terminal be set:

	$ SET TERM/NOWRAP/FORM/NOBROAD

There's also some tutorials:

	$ GRO/COM=GRLOOKDIR:BRIEF	!short lesson
	$ GRO/COM=GRLOOKDIR:TUTOR1	!more extensive
	$ GRO/COM=GRLOOKDIR:TUTOR2	!"Building a worksheet"

There is a manual with this one that is quite reasonable, certainly much better
than FlowCalc's manual.

unfortunately, I cannot.

My copy came with very little punctuation and with words missing.

I don't know what you mean by " comm " or " para's " or what it is that

Subj:	book review


	Merry Thanksgiving, native American day of mourning.

	This is a review of a book called The Evolution of Cooperation, by
Robert Axelrod, a political scientist and game theorist.  The back cover of 
the book includes the following quotes -

	"I never expected to find wisdom or hope for the future of our species
	in a computer game, but here it is, in Axelrod's book.  Read it." - 
	Lewis Thomas, M.D. (Read his books too.)

	"When I read The Evolution of Cooperation in draft form, I scribbled
	all over my copy: 'Incredible!' 'Amazing!' 'Weird!' 'Fantastic!' 
	'Fascinating!' 'Elegant!' 'Great!'  I guess that tells you what I 
	genuinely think of this book." - Douglas Hofstadter, author of Godel, 
	Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (Another good read, at least for 
	skipping around in.)

	These guys aren't exaggerating, plus the book's relatively short and
easy reading.  Here's how I heard about the book - First, someone who read my
War & Games article in Sept. Creative Computing sent me a copy of a review that
a friend of his wrote about the book.  Then another reader of the article, and
president of an educational software company, sent an Apple program he had 
written which, based on Axelrod's book, allows you to play the Prisoner's
Dilemma and vary the computer's strategy.  And then a group called Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility wrote to say that a group had formed
in Berkeley to study and write a paper about applying the Prisoner's Dilemma
model to attempts to understand and redirect the arm's race.  (These meetings
are every other Thursday in Berkeley, starting Nov. 29.  Contact me if you're
interested.)

	So let me talk a bit about what's in the book and then I'll discuss why
it might be of interest to game designers.  The essence of life often seems to
be paradox, and the Prisoner's Dilemma is an elegant mathematical model of one
basic type of paradox, "in which what is best for each person individually
leads to mutual defection, whereas everyone would have been better off with
mutual cooperation."  Axelrod uses the theory to examine the uses of
cooperation and competition in warfare, business, Congress, and biological
systems.  The basic dilemma is (quoting from the inside liner): "How can
cooperation emerge among self-seeking individuals when there is no central
authority to police their actions?  It is a question that has troubled
philosophers and statesmen for hundreds of years; its importance has never been
greater than in today's world of nuclear weapons." 

	Axelrod manages to answer this question for the 2x2 Prisoner's Dilemma
and to suggest the implications this solution has for the real world.  He
started by organizing computer tournaments to which he invited computer
hobbyists and professional game theorists to submit their favorite strategy for
playing the Prisoner's Dilemma.  Competing programs included 1) a program based
on 'outcome maximization', 2) Random, 3) one that cooperates initially but then
defects forever after the other side's first defection, 4) "a sneaky rule that
tries to get by with an occasional defection," 5) a program that is designed to
"look for softies, but is prepared to back off if the other player shows it
won't be exploited", and 6) a program that "first seeks to establish a mutually
rewarding relationship with the other player, and only then does it cautiously
try to see if it will be allowed to get away with something."  

	The winning entry was the shortest and simplest of all the programs -
called Tit for Tat, it says to start with cooperation and then do what the
other side did on the last round.  While this is not necessarily the winning
strategy independent of the environment, it is fairly robust, due to four
properties:

	1) It is 'nice' - it avoids unnecessary conflict as long as the other
player does.
	2) It is retaliatory - it responds immediately to provocation.
	3) It is forgiving - it backs off from retaliation as soon as the 
other player stops provoking it.
	4) It is clear - the other side can easily predict its behavior, and
adapt to it by cooperating. 

	Tit for Tat is not capable of beating any of the other strategies
one on one, and yet it does best in the tournament because it gets the other
strategies to cooperate with it.  The moral here for success in non-zero sum
games is - don't be envious.  Don't compare your score to your opponent's
score, but to how well someone else could be doing in your situation.

	The key factor to the success of a strategy such as this is the shadow
of the future - the importance of future relations between the same 
individuals.

	The theory gets extended to show how the different strategies will
evolve in time (including a graph of how an initially successful non-nice
rule soon becomes extinct as a result of the extinction of the unsuccessful
rules it was exploiting.)  Axelrod proves a number of theorems, such as one
which states that a society of 'meanies' (who always defect) can resist an
invasion by any other strategy which invades 1 by 1 (but a small cluster of the
other strategy can invade relatively easily by surviving off of their
cooperations with each other.)  However a society made up of a 'nice' strategy
can be resistant to invasion by 'meanies', even in a cluster.  Then he extends
the theory to territorial patterns (of nations, businesses, birds, etc.)  and
shows graphs of how different strategies can evolve spatially. 

	Why do I mention all this?  Well, it's that time of year when some of
us are finishing up our games and starting to think about new ones, and I want
to nudge those new games in certain directions.  I'd like to see more games
that allow the player to explore the continuum of cooperation and competition.
This was very successful in Joust, Rip-Off, and a few other games.  And I'd
like to see more 2-player games in general - 2 player Marble Madness is, 
strictly speaking, a competitive game, but it give you a range of 
competitiveness from hard-core knock-the-other-guy-over-the-edge, to just
racing against the clock.  And it might be nice to have games with less 
emphasis on scores, or no scores at all, or seeing only your score and not
the other player's, or having a score which is the sum of your score and
the opponent's score.  Of course I'd also like to see more games like Whack-
A-Mole (why were there no Whack-A-Moles in the auction, that's what I'd like
to know.)

	If indeed people form attitudes about life from the games they play, 
and if indeed Ronald Reagan sees the world as a game of Risk, we might as well
be making games that, in a very non-educational way, teach this new generation
of little Ronnies out there that the world is not necessarily a zero-sum game,
that there are ways to play the game so that both sides win. 

	I think there are sparks in this book which could ignite a great game
idea.  The 2-player Prisoner's Dilemma itself is rather boring to play,
although some fun and visually interesting patterns might result from the
2-d territorial evolution version of the game.  The real interest is in the
meta-game, the insights from which could be (and have been) applied to a 
variety of situations.  I have some thoughts on the subject, which I would
be glad to discuss with anyone interested, as soon as we all have more time
(i.e., January.)

	The book is available for borrowing from me, and for sale in finer
bookstores everywhere.

Subj:	SYSTEM I AUDIO BALANCING IS COMPLETE AND PRODUCTION RELEASED


	People not involved with audio for System I need not read on:

Brad, with the aid of Sam, Don, Minh and others too numerous to name
have completed the relative balancing of the Pokey, Yamaha and TI Sound
chips and this "balance" has been incorporated into the production
released parts list.  If you have serious concerns about the appropriateness
of this balance after reading the rest of the message, please contact me
or Brad Fuller.

QUESTION:	What do you have to do to make the audio on your board be 
		like production?
ANSWER:		Nothing.
REASON:		All voice cartridges of any REV and 
		TTL Main Boards REV(A) and REV(2) modified to REV(A) 
		(these will have "REV(A)" marked on the edge connector) 
		have the correct component values.  In case you question
		your board the "balance" and proper filter/noise supression
		values are listed at the end of this message.

METHOD OF BALANCING:
		If you are interested in how Brad arrived at this 
		standard, here is what he did.


Adjustment of audio levels for YAMAHA, POKEY and TIVOX for SYSTEM I

"To calculate the initial gain of the YAMAHA chip set and POKEY, we first
produced a full volume sine wave from YAMAHA and a full volume square wave from
POKEY and 'course' adjusted the level for POKEY. Since it's best to use a real
live situation we used PACKRAT music and sound effects to 'fine' set the POKEY
level. We had to compromise on the setting since all music and sound effects
are never at the same level. After the final adjustment we measured the average
output of both chips. The POKEY was at about half the peak amplitude as the
YAMAHA. 

"To adjust the TIVOX chip level we installed a pot to adjust the TIVOX chip
gain. This enabled us to set the TIVOX chip for the level desired, then measure
the resistance at the pot. Since POKEY sounds are usually intermittent sounds
it was best to use the sound source that the TIVOX chip would have to
continually compete against, i.e. YAMAHA music. We used different types and
volumes of music to adjust the TIVOX chip gain. After adjustment of the TIVOX
chip, we realized that it was very close to the original setting calculated by
Don Paauw."

Subj:	System I Audio Level

The audio output level should be increased to 5 Vp-p during normal
game play, and should have a reasonable amount of headroom for peaks.

Background:

1. If you leave the output purposefully low so that the audio does not clip 
under any conditions, then most of the time it will not be as loud as it 
could otherwise be.

2. By having the output high enough to clip with the volume control all the
way up you assure that it can be adjusted for maximum loudness.
Presumably the operators will adjust it short of clipping.

3. In the old days, the volume was controlled via a rheostat at the
amplifier output, so that if the amplifier was clipping it could
not be fixed by turning the volume down. The volume control pots
on Regulator/Audio III are at the amplifier input.

4. The amount of dynamic range available for arcade games is fairly narrow.
Arcades tend to be noisy, which sets the low end. The high end is set by the 
amount of audio power reaching the player's ears and is limited by the 
threshhold of pain. Also, if too many sounds are turned on at the same time,
they will simply become an indistinguishable jumble.  

5. Generally, sounds with very high ratios of peak to average levels (like 
explosions) have been allowed to clip. Otherwise, if the system is adjusted
to handle the peaks, the average volume level is too low.

Subj:	1st Notice of ECN's Against SYSTEM I Board Sets


Here's the first notice to Engineering of published ECN's against the 
SYSTEM I board set.  I'm mailing this to the engineer's and technicians 
involved in the project, to Chris Downend because he's the overall 
Project Leader on this one, and to the "unattached" programmers who 
may not have a technician or engineer looking out for their board.
If you want to be deleted from this distribution list would you scan 
the list to make sure that someone is looking out for you before requesting
deletion.

Two ECN's (#11963, 11962) are fully released against the TTL Main
Board.  A constructively edited copy of the ECN's is available for
XEROXing at the System I H/W Bulletin board in Minh's lab.  Please update your
boards and mark them with the ECN numbers.
The 2 1% resistors for the intensity circuit (ECN 11963 page 4) have not 
arrived as samples yet.  Trim your own or wait.

If I understand your spec correctly, we will only be getting 6.8 watts
(per channel) if using the supply for stereo.  I don't think this will
be enough.  We are pretty close to the edge with what we are running now
(12 watts, I believe).  10 watts would be OK, maybe 9, but NOT 6.8

	If there is anything you can do to bring the power up to greater
than 10 watts, please, PLEASE, PLEASE, consider it.

Re: Regulator/Audio III Costs
Dt: 12/20/84

I just received a copy of Rod Peterson's cost information on the 
Regulator/Audio III.

I used the best information I could get, and it was wrong. I used as many 
parts from inventory as I could and then it turned out these parts had been 
scrapped.

It makes me look bad and I am mad as hell about it.

Regulator/Audio III	Rod Peterson's cost	 =    	$31.95

			My estimate in September =    -	$23.64
							-------
							$8.31

Total Increase:
---------------
			  1.  Inventory Parts		$1.91
			  2.  CTS Pot			 1.01
			  3.  PC Board			 3.75
			  4.  TDA 2030			 1.20
			  5.  Heat Sink			  .49
							------
							$8.36

Item 1
-------
When I did my cost estimate I used the best information I could get, which was 
the AMPS system before it was turned off. This was in September.

As an example take 24-250477 (470 uF 25V Electrolytic Capacitor). According
to AMPS we had 71,350 in inventory and paid $0.11 a piece. How could they now
cost $0.477? And why do they cost almost twice as much as a 1000 uF 25V part?

	Was the original AMPS entry incorrect? 

	Did the capacitors somehow increase in cost while they were sitting in 
	inventory? 

	Did our inventory go through some kind of time warp?

	Did we store them in a 747 that was kept in the air (with in-flight
	refueling) so as to be immediately available once it was determined
	where the factory was going to be?

	Did we sell them off and buy them back? 

There are 9 items that fall into this category, accounting for an increase
of $1.91 .

Item 2
------
	The CTS volume control pot (119011-103) is listed as $2.028  .
According to the quote I got from CTS, this would correspond to a quantity
of 300 pieces. Are we buying our parts in quantities of 300? 

This accounts for an increase of $1.01 .

Item 3
------
	The PC Board used in the Regulator/Audio II is 91 square inches 
(6.5" x 14") and costs $8.08 . (0.0888/sq in)

	The PC Board for Regulator/Audio III is 119 square inches (8.5" x 14") 
and costs $12.25. (0.103/sq in). Why is that?

Item 4
------
	The TDA-2030 used in the switcher was listed as $1.50 each. Why are
they now $2.10 ?

Item 5
------
	The cost of the Heat Sink increased by $.49, presumably by having
three more holes drilled in it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is impossible to get reliable cost information ahead of time. However, 
critical Engineering decisions are often based on price differences of $1.00 or
less. 

It is no longer possible to base a design on the cost effective use of parts in
inventory, because these parts could be scrapped at any time without notice.

Atari's system makes parts cost too much because:

	Atari sells parts from inventory and then buys them back (at an 
	inflated price).

	Parts that require some amount of lead time are purchased at a
	premium because parts are not bought until the game is released
	and games are manufactured as soon as they are released.

	There does not seem to be any way of buying parts in quantities
	beyond what is necessary for the next release of 300 games.

If you want to avoid a price increase on the Transformer Power Base,
Alltronics-Howard is selling them for $10. Ginsu knives are not included.

there is a bunch of stuff on:-

This covers the linker,locator,formatter and mapper etc.

The assembler is "Motorola standard" and as such doesn't require 
documentation, or at least that is what they told me. However there is a 
motorola "MAcro assembler manual" available from motorola, nobody I know
has a copy that is up to date.

The intermetrics C compiler documentation is in my office, and the 
greenhills is available from the vax, ask mike mahar where it is.

	Hope you find the stuff, any problems with the intermetrics stuff
	let me know.

Subj:	A/R III COST


I REVIEWED THE COSTING MYSELF.  I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH YOUR COMMENTS.
THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED ODD TO ME WAS THE ORIGINAL PCB COST; AT 10
CENTS A SQ. IN. IT'S A BARGAIN.  THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO PAY FOR PCB'S
IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS.  OUR TYPICAL ESTIMATE IN COIN OP HAS BEEN AS HIGH AS
15 CENTS PER SQ. IN.  BUT IF THE OLD A/R PCB WAS SO LOW, THE COST RATIO
SHOULD HOLD AS SOLELY A FUNCTION OF AREA - WHEN PURCHASED AT THE SAME
VOLUME.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT - I SUGGEST WE GET A DETAILED EXPLANATION FROM
PURCHASING.                   D.R.S.

Subj:	Give a man enough rope...


    For those of you who like to screw up more than one file at a time,
here's a way to have a real orgy.  NO WARRANTIES EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSEQUENCES ARISING FROM USE OF THIS PRODUCT.  THIS
TOOL IS GUARANTEED NOT (repeat NOT) TO WORK AS ANTICIPATED, AND WILL
(GUARANTEED) SCREW UP AS MANY FILES AS POSSIBLE.  This is a product of
Murphy's Awfullest Designs, guaranteed (only) to drive you M.A.D.

    Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, let's proceed.

    There are occasions to do batch processing (even on DEC computers) of
a number of files.  I have written a command file to parse a wildcarded
file specification, and iteratively process each file matching the spec
for those commands where wildcards are not appropriate.

    An application example:

    Recently it was rediscovered (by several people) that DECNET does not
support STREAM-LF files (the only kind C likes).  (The bad news is that
it will continue to not support them, even in version 4, coming to a vax
near you sometime in 1985.)  DECNET requires major revisions for this, and
Dave & I are not able to supply these changes as patches, so until DEC fixes
the source code, C and DECNET won't like each other.

    The good news is that there is a workaround.  When you EDT a stream-lf
file, a variable-length/cr file is created for output.  DECNET LIKES these
files  (I can't speak for C programs from practical experience).  So, a
mass conversion was needed.

    The example:

    First, a file was created (say EXIT.EDT) containing the line "EXIT" only.
Then the symbol PROCESS was defined to be "EDIT/EDT/COMMAND=EXIT.EDT".  At
this point, we can say in dcl, "$PROCESS file" to change said file from
stream-lf to variable.  Now "$@SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]DOFILE *.OL"
is executed, which will PROCESS each .OL file (the latest version only).

    I have a symbol defined for this, but you may not want to do that because
of how dangerous this could be.  You can be assured that the command file
(DOFILE, that is) checks to make sure that PROCESS is defined.  However, once
you define it, it stays defined until you log out or do a $RESTART.  So if you
convert *.OL, for example, and then (accidentally) $DOFILE *.*, you will have
a real mess.  Avoiding the symbol definition for DOFILE is one way to make this
possibility even more remote.

    DOFILE is not limited to "doit toit" commands.  For example, a mass
rename or copy might be done by a command file, and PROCESS be equated to 
"@commandfile" in order to provide the linkage.  The command file might
then contain "$COPY 'P1' LQ0:".  Incidentally, don't experiment with this
particular example.

    There are some other potentially destructive command files that I might
release if this one doesn't come back to haunt me.  It is potentially very
useful as well as disastrous, and I leave the protection against yourself
entirely up to you.

    As always, should any of your files be caught, or killed, the backups will
disavow any knowlege of your data.  Good luck, user!

The Approved Vendors List will be moved from ERNIE to CHARM sometime
between now and Monday.

If you have defined a word in your LOGIN.COM file to access the
AVL, you may have to make a modification to it..

Users with accounts on remote nodes (ERNIE, KIM, or SANDY)

Type "SET HOST CHARM" and login to CHARM as "READAVL" (no password 
required).  When you exit READAVL, you will be returned to your
default node and directory.
You may copy CHARM::SYS$USERDISK:[AVL]READAVL.COM to your directory and define
a word in your LOGIN.COM file to execute it.
Example: $AVL :==@READAVL.COM

Users with accounts on CHARM:

Type "@ATARI$AVL:LOGIN" at the VAX system prompt ($), or just add the line
below to your LOGIN.COM file and then type "AVL" after your next login.

                       $ AVL :==@ATARI$AVL:LOGIN


Both of these methods will execute a menu driven program that will allow you
to search the AVL and either save the results in a file in your own directory
(if it's on CHARM) or forward the results to your mailbox.
