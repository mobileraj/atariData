GAME HARDWARE IDEA - NEW 3D COLOR XY		Jed Margolin  1/25/83


	The following is a description of the hardware architecture I am

plannning on designing for the Tomcat research project. I am submitting

it here because the hardware may be applicable to other games.


	There are 3 basic sections: The Host Processor; The Vector Generator;

and the Aux Processor.

   1. The Host Processor will be a 16032 or 68000 and will be supercharged

with the Warp Speed Matrix Processor. (Perspective division will be done by 

the Host.) The Host Processor will do all the 3D math and deliver to the

Vector Generator an updated point table for each object. 

   2. The Vector Generator will probably be similar to the analog type 

currently being used; however, it will contain the algorithms to connect the

points for each object so that the Host Processor will not have to spend time 

formatting vectors.

	3. The Aux Processor will be a 6502 or a 6809 and will do:

	   A. Sounds

	   B. Speech

	   C. Coins
	   
	   D. EAROM stuff

	   E. Pot reading with A/D Converter

	   F. Communication between games

NAME OF GAME: YourFaceOnthePlayer BASEBALL OR MAYBE FOOTBALL

PERSPECTIVE: 3rd Person

HARDWARE: Color Raster, Macho 44, Speech Synthesizer, CCD Image Sensor

OBJECT OF THE GAME: Baseball, with two improvements:

	1. At the beginning of the game, a CCD image sensor will take the
	   player's picture and put his face on all of his team members.
	   If the player makes the high score table there will be no initials,
	   just players' faces.

	2. A speech synthesizer (or two) will provide play-by-play and color
	   commentary of the game taking into account how well the player is
	   doing.

NAME OF THE GAME: COCKROACH WARS

PERSPECTIVE: 3rd Person

HARDWARE: Color XY, or High Resolution Raster

OBJECT OF THE GAME: This is a two player competitive game where each player 
		    controls an animated, articulated cockroach.
		    The action takes place on several scrolling playfields:
			UNDER THE KITCHEN SINK,
			UNDER THE REFRIGERATOR,
			IN THE PANTRY, and
		        IN THE BATHROOM (don't get trapped in the bathtub). 
		    As the two cockroaches fight they have to avoid periodic
		    natural disasters such as a human exclaiming, "Look Fred,
		    we have cockroaches, again." The players would then have a
		    limited amount of time to scurry to safety.

		    Perhaps we could use a CCD imaging device to put the
		    player's face on the cockroach.

		    If cockroaches are too distasteful, use mice.

RE:LPB0

	I left the listings in the basket because I felt it was the one
place where they would NOT mess things up. But if you want them ON the printer
then that is where they will go.

	And while we're on the subject, last week I tried to help a
SCI-CARDS person cancel a duplicate listing.(It seems that when his
listing did not appear in WESTPRINT he figured something had gone wrong
and ordered another listing.) Because the directions for cancelling
a printout were so thoughtfully provided on the printer, he and I tried
them. They didn't work.

Dt: 2/14/83


1. Per your request that "Resistors R13 and R14 should be moved so as
   not to short against ground trace (rear of board)."

	On the board I was shown the resistor leads were excessively
	long, causing them to short out when they were bent back.
	But If Manufacturing reallly thinks the traces should be moved,
	then ok.  


2. Per your comment that the "Trace from collector of Q3 to cathode
   of CR4 is being blown off board resulting in severe damage to PCB."

	On one board that I examined, CR1 and CR4 were both shorted,
	causing a short from 10.3 VDC to ground. On another board
	CR1 was shorted and CR4 apppeared to have been replaced,
	the original CR4 presumably having been shorted also.

	CR1 and CR4 are both protection diodes and do not normally
	conduct any current unless they are installed backwards,
	which was NOT the case in the boards I examined.

	I recommend we try to trace these diodes and find out if
	we had a shipment of bad or incorrectly marked 1N4002's.
	The only other explanation for these failures would be
	if the boards had somehow been connected to the supply
	backwards.

Re: Reasons for Buying more CIT-101 Terminals


The department currently has five CIT-101 terminals:

	Carol has one at her desk for word processing;

	Greg and Norman each have one in their offices;

	There are two in the Hanger Lab, each associated with a 
	development system (both are for Star Wars).

 There are currently no terminals available for general use. Those
of us who need to use the VAX have to squeeze in time on one of
the above systems.

	I use the VAX frequently for programming and for generating and
maintaining documentation.
	
	Earl also uses the VAX extensively and in fact should have one
allocated for his exclusive use as have Greg and Norman.

	Rick Meyette uses the VAX for word processing.

	Tom Rice has expressed an interest in computerizing parts lists,
inventories, etc.  I am trying to talk him into using the VAX rather
than buying another Atari 800 system.



	I propose that we purchase three CIT-101 terminals. One will go
to Earl and two will be installed in the labs for general use.


	Alternately, one would go to Earl, one would go to me (in my office)
and one would go to the lab for general use.

Re: "Video-game makers rush to add 3-D chip"
Dt: 3/7/83


Attached is a copy of an article that appeared in the San Jose Mercury

News, March 2, 1983. The chip being touted as a magic chip to do 3-D

is the 2516 16*16 multiplier. I talked to Dave Barnet of Weitek

last year when it first came out and again this afternoon to

update my information.

	The 2516 is an NMOS version of a TRW Bipolar Multiplier.

Because it is NMOS it dissipates less power and so can be packaged

in plastic. It also runs slower than the TRW part.

	Last year the 2516 was being offered in a 1 us version

for $68. This year it is a 200 ns part and goes for about $40

in quantities of 5,000. (The TRW Bipolar Multiplier does a

multiply in about 40 ns and costs twice as much.)

	The 2516 was not cost effective last year at $68 and it

is not cost effective this year at $40. The multiplier/accumulator  

that I use in Star Wars is made out of MSI and costs about $12 (and 

does more than just multiply). 

	The basic operation in doing 3-D transformations is to accumulate 

products such as in ACC'= ACC + A*B. The 2516 does not accumulate products, 

it is  only a multiplier. (Weitek has expressed an interest in working with 

Atari to produce a low power multiplier/accumulator.) My Multiplier/Accumulator

also does a presubtract to make calculations more efficient 

[ ACC'= (A-B)*C + ACC ]. On the other hand, my multiplier is slower 

(2.7 us vs 200 ns for the Weitek).

	Raw multiplier speed is only part of story in doing 3-D 

transformations. In performing the 3-D math, lots of data has to be fed

into the multiplier, and results retrieved, and additions performed (if

the multiplier does not also accumulate products). If a device such

as the 2516 were put on an 8 bit microcomputer bus, even if the multiplier

took zero time it would be several times slower than the current 

Star Wars hardware. (A 2516 put on a 10 MHz 68000 or 6 MHz 16032 would

probably be nice and fast, but a multiplier/accumulator would be better).

	The Star Wars hardware deals with the throughput problem by having

a simple microprogrammed device keep the multiplier/accumulator fed. The

points that define an object are downloaded by a 6809 host processor

at the beginning of the game (or wave) into a RAM it shares with the 

microprogammed machine (the Matrix Processor). When it comes time

to display an object, the host processor supplies a pointer which

tells the matrix processor where the object's points are stored. The

host processor tells the matrix processor which algorithm to use, and

each of the object's points is transformed, one at a time.

	I resent having to generate this memo, having to defend hardware

that I designed THREE YEARS AGO. When the project was Warp Speed it received 

no support from management. Now that it has become Star Wars and Atari 

has paid George Lucas one or two million dollars there is more interest 

in the project. However, the game that is being developed does not take

advantage of the real capabilities of either hardware or algorithms. 

This is very discouraging and makes it very difficult to maintain

any enthusiasm in a subject area for which management obviously

has so little regard. And I don't want to hear any more crap about

Weitek's great 3-D chip.

Re: Votrax SC-02
Dt: 3/8/83



Summary: The SC-02 doesn't sound as good as the TI system we are now using.
	 We would lose the ability to have the speech recognizable as 
	 belonging to a particular person (like Luke Skywalker).
	 The development tools available for the SC-02 are much cruder than
	 what we already have for the TI system.


The information I have on the Votrax SC-02A comes from the following sources:

	A Concept Definition of the SC-02 in a memo from Steve Bristow
dated 5/4/81;

	A memo from Steve Bristow summarizing the meeting with Votrax on
6/5/81;

	Preliminary Specification of SC-02 in a letter from Al Lubienski
(Votrax General Manager) to Michel Ebertin, dated 9/1/81;

	A sample tape from Votrax demonstrating the SC-02;

	A conversation with Randy Hall (of VCS fame) on 5/4/82;

	
This is what I know:

	My notes indicate that I thought the sample tape made with the SC-02 
sounded better than the SC-01 but not as good as the TI synthesizer. It does 
not appear that the SC-02 can be programmed to be recognizable as belonging to
a particular person. (The sound effects weren't bad, though).

	The SC-02 is an improved version of the SC-01. The phonemes 
have supposedly been improved and the user can control more of the 
atttributes of the speech. The tape mentions that the atttributes 
could be extracted from recorded speech. If all of the attributes 
are used, the bit rate is 240 bits/sec (versus 1200-1800 bits/sec for TI).
If the attributes are not used the bit rate is closer to 70 bits/sec
and it ends up sounding just like the SC-01.

The schedule Randy gave me was as follows -

		samples - Christmas
		production - 1st Q 83
		Development Station - 1st Q 83 ($15K)
		   (does not extract features from recorded speech)
		Estimate 100K - $10.
			   1M - $5.


In order to fully utilize the additional capabilities of the SC-02
we would have to hire a linguist to develop vocabulary and/or we
would have to design a unit that analyzes recorded speech and extracts 
the required attributes from it. I do not think a person who is
not a linguist could sit down at a VDT and create acceptable
vocabulary for the SC-02.


If Votrax has made really significant changes since last May, my
information may be out of date.


The last I heard from Dave Remson (VCS) was that General Instrument was
developing for them a two channel speech synthesizer based on the
GI SP0250. The SP0250 would have been my first choice for Coin-Op
to use if it hadn't become apparent that GI was unable to provide
the necessary support for us to use it successfully. If they are
successful in developing it and providing decent development tools
we may want to switch over to it at some future time (and take 
advantage of VCS quantity discounts).

If this deal with GI is still in the works why this sudden (and
misplaced) interest in Votrax?

I amm writing this memo on Saturday. I came in at about 1:45p to 
work on Star Wars.

Facilities chose today to wax and polish the floors in our labs.

Equipment has been disconnected, moved around this way and that, 
Erik's radio has been turned on full blast, and the Star Wars game 
is no longer working.

I called Security and talked to Barbara (whose supervisor's name is
Dennis Johnson) who said it was a matter for Facilities, not Security.
She said she would try to have someone from Facilities paged but
was apparently unsucessful. The guys doing the work here said they
worked for Gavaer Ramerez.

When I left here at 3:30 am last night everything was intact, and working.

This is not the first time that Facilities has shown a callous disregard
for projects that I have been working on. On several occasions they
have moved prototype games (with circuit boards and cables trailing 
behind) to replace stained ceiling tiles. Presumably they do this
to other projects as well.

And just when I was starting to work on the game I was asked to leave
so they could put on the wax on the floor.

I request that you (and Dan, and John, if that is what it takes) TELL
Facilities that under NO circumstances are they to move ANY of our
equipment without PRIOR approval.

Getting Star Wars into production is already tough enough without this
SABOTAGE from the Facilities Department.

Re: Microprocessor Test Connector and Darl Davidson
Dt: 3/29/83



Manufacturing does not use the Microprocessor Test Connector.


Repair Technicians in the field do use it because that is how the
CAT Box connects to the game board.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What the CAT Box Does:

The CAT Box gives repair technicians (in the field) access to the processor's
bus and enables him to test for open or shorted address and data lines,
read switch inputs, turn outputs on and off, test RAM, and perform
Signature Analysis.
 
When people use the CAT Box to perform signature analysis on game
ROMs, the CAT Box connects a counter to the address lines and simply
runs through the addresses. By using a ROM Select to start and stop
the Signature Analyzer, a signature is taken for the bit pattern in
that ROM, thus establishing whether the ROM is good. This is usually
done just for the ROM containing the reset and interrupt vectors and 
test routines; if this ROM is good the game will probably be able to 
run Self-Test.

Because the address decoders are not strobed but are free to glitch
until the address is valid, it has been necessary, in order to use
the CAT Box Signature Analyzer, for the technician to attach capacitors
to a few address lines to remove these glitches. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the pins that appear on the Test Connector also appear on the
microprocessor socket, so my idea was to do an interface board so
that people would remove the processor (which they must do anyway)
and plug in this adapter (which would connect to the CAT Box). Also
on this interface board would be a strobed latch so that Signature
Analysis could be performed without using kludge capacitors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I talked to Darl Davidson and Frank Becker on 3/28 about this and they were
adament against doing this. Their reasons were:

	1. Taking off the Test Connector would be perceived as 
	   "Atari cheaping out".
	2. It would require twice as many insertions and removals in the
	   processor socket. We use cheap sockets which are supposedly
	   good for 10 insertions.
	3. They were concerned that the people who needed the adapters
	   wouldn't buy them and would become very angry when they couldn't
	   use their CAT Boxes with the game.
	4. Their experience with adapters was that adapters don't work. They
	   referred to a Z80 adapter that someone is alleged to have
	   perpetrated.


I was not aware that our sockets were that poor.  On the other hand, I learned
that the kludge capacitors are usually stuck into the processor's empty socket.
That can't be very good for the socket, considering the diameter of most 
capacitor's leads.

The other reasons might be valid but probably are not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have an even better solution.

When the 6809E HALT line is brought low, the processor finishes the current
instruction and halts with Address, Data, and R/W lines TRI-STATE. Therefore,
with the HALT line low, the CAT Box could be connected to the game without
removing the processor (unless there was some reason to believe that the
processor was bad and wouldn't go Tri-State). 

This could be accomplished in two ways:
	1. HALT would be automatically grounded with the CAT Box plugged
	   into the current Test Connector.
	2. An IC clip (similar to the ones we use on the HP Logic Analyzers)
	   would clip onto the processor, grounding the HALT line. This
	   cable would have to go to a small interface board which would
	   accept the CAT Box connector.

If this is done, there will be no place to stick the kludge capacitors. 

If we use method 1, we could put in the traces for a latch and leave it 
unstuffed. If someone wants to do signature analysis they will have to 
solder one in (talk about cheap). We could, instead, stuff a socket, or
probably for the same cost, stuff the IC (a 74LS74). I do not have any
unused latches on the Star Wars Main Board.

If we use method 2, a strobed latch can be included on the interface board.

I prefer method 2.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I told Darl that I was willing to keep the Test Connector on the Main Board
but that I would not put one on the Sound Board. He seemed satisfied with
the arrangement. 

In any event, I strongly disapprove of using kludge capacitors, especially
when they are shoved into a microprocessor socket. If we go with method 1
I want to put the extra LS74 on the Main Board. If we go with method 2
it would go on the Interface Board.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My next step is to have Erik put together a CAT Box Interface Board so we
can demonstrate its advantages.


I wanted you to know what I am doing in this matter because Darl has strong
feelings about the Test Connector and has threatened to go to Dan and John
over it.

Re: Speakers
Dt: 5/10/83


The following applies to the TDA-2002s as they are used in the 
Regulator/Audio I and Regulator/Audio II boards. All power ratings
assume an unclipped sine wave.

SUMMARY:

When used in a game that produces a single audio channel the power amplifiers 
are usually connected in push-pull and will deliver 12.5 Watts into a 4 ohm 
load. This can be a single 4 ohm speaker, two 8 ohm speakers in parallel, 
or an array of four 4 ohm speakers. 

Games with a single audio channel tend to use two 8 ohm speakers. 

In a game that produces two audio channels, each amplifier must have
a 2 ohm load if the total output is to remain 12.5 Watts. Star Wars
uses two audio channels (because of the Image Expander) but only uses 
two 4 ohm speakers and therefore its total output is 6.25 Watts 
(3.12 Watts per channel). Ideally it should have had four 4 ohm speakers 
or two 2 ohm speakers. If each amplifier were driving an 8 ohm speaker, 
the power would drop to 1.5 Watts per channel (for a total of 3.12 Watts) 
and it would probably not be loud enough in an arcade environment.

If only 8 ohm speakers were available, the Star Wars Image Expander could 
not be used. 

If only 4 ohm speakers were available, a single channel game would be limited
to 6.25 Watts instead of the 12.5 Watts currently available with 8 ohm
speakers.

Standardizing on speakers is a bad idea.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND:

When operated from a 10 Volt supply, a TDA-2002 will deliver 6.25 Watts
(sine wave) into a 2 ohm load or 3.12 Watts into a 4 ohm load.

With two TDA-2002s, the amount of power that can be delivered to a
load is 2x6.25 = 12.5 Watts (sine wave). This is with both amplifiers
driving 2 ohm loads.

At this point you might object, "But we don't have any two ohm speakers."

This is the answer:

	When a game provides only one audio channel, the two TDA-2002s
	are usually operated in push-pull with the speaker connected 
	across the amplifiers outputs. This doubles the output voltage
	across the speaker, which multiplies the power by four. 
	(P=V*V/R). If we take the example of a single TDA-2002 driving a 
	4 ohm speaker we get 3.12 Watts. If we run two TDA-2002s in 
	push-pull we will get 3.12x4=12.5 Watts. The quadrupling of
	power is not free. The current required from each amplifier
	is doubled. The main effect is to "split" the load between
	each amplifier so that each amplifier sees R/2.

Thus in a push-pull system a 4 ohm speaker will be seen by each amplifier 
as a 2 ohm load, and the TDA-2002s will deliver 12.5 Watts to the speaker.  
 
If the designer wanted to use two speakers and put two 4 ohm speakers in 
parallel, the result would be a two ohm system which each TDA-2002 would 
see as a 1 ohm load which it couldn't drive effectively.
    	
If the 4 ohm speakers are put in series, the result is an 8 ohm system 
which each TDA-2002 would see as a 4 ohm system. That's fine except we 
now have each amplifier driving a 4 ohm load and delivering 3.12 Wattts 
for a grand total of 6.24 Watts. This decrease in power would be offset 
somewhat by the increase in speaker efficiency produced by having a 
greater cone area, but there is a better solution.

If we take two 8 ohm speakers and put them in parallel (making sure they 
are phased properly) we get an effective system load of 4 ohms, which 
each TDA-2002 will see as 2 ohms. The amplifiers will therefore deliver 
12.5 Watts to the system.

If we wanted to use four speakers (like Space Duel) they would be 4 ohm 
speakers in both series and parallel to again produce a 4 ohm system. 
Which is why Space Duel is so loud.
	 
So, it seems we can standardize on either four 4 ohm speakers or two 
8 ohm speakers in every game. 
	   
Wrong.

Games with a single audio channel have tended to use two 8 ohm speakers. 
Star Wars (with fake stereo) is using two 4 ohm speakers. Ideally it 
should have had four 4 ohm speakers or two 2 ohm speakers. 

Star Wars uses a stereo synthesizer so that each TDA-2002 must must 
used separately; they cannot be connected in push-pull. The upright 
game originally used four 4 ohm speakers connected to produce two 
arrays of 2 ohms each. This would have produced 12.5 Watts of audio. 
Unfortunately, in a futile attempt to hold the cost down, two speakers 
were eliminated. Thus, Star Wars is limited to 6.25 Watts of audio. 
With 8 ohm speakers the system would deliver 1.5 Watts/channel, for a
total of 3.12 Watts.

The sitdown game currently uses four 4 ohm speakers but it may be 
necessary to replace the upper channels with 8 ohm speakers to give a 
better balance between the upper and lower speakers.

It is too soon to tell if fake (or real) stereo is the wave of the
future. But standardizing on either 4 or 8 ohm speakers would be a
mistake and would send a clear message to those who have been working
in this area that there is no support for audio in this company.

According to the data sheet, PMI's DAC-312 should perform as well as AMD's

This kind of test should not take the place of a full scale component

Re: Cinematronics Video Disc Game
Dt: 7/13/83

I had the opportunity to examine Cinematronics' new Video Disc Game
at Central Park and noticed the following:

	1. The game did not have an FCC sticker.

	2. There was NO video overlay. The picture on the screen came
	   solely from the Video Disc. Scoring, credits, and lives were
	   done on a separate LED panel. I didn't see any high score table.

	3. The game logic was on a small board and had several ROMs, a
	   processor (I couldn't see whose it was), a GI Sound IC, maybe
	   a separate processor for sounds, two audio amplifiers, option
	   switches, and the usual assortment of other stuff.

	4. Even though it had the sound IC, I cannot recall having heard
	   it in the game. It sounded like all the audio came from 
	   the disc player.

	5. The Video Disc player was a standard unit, sitting on the
	   bottom of the cabinet. I couldn't see the manufacturer's
	   name on it. The digital interface just plugged in; it probably
	   came with the unit rather than have been kludged on.

	6. When the game was turned on, there was no color and there was
	   a noticeable jitter in part of the picture. The attendant
	   said that the game had always had that problem. When we turned the 
	   game off and then on again, when the disc came up to speed the
	   color worked and the jitter was gone. When we moved the game
	   the color went away again but came back after a disc player 
	   restart.

	7. The screen blanks out for varying periods of time during disc track
	   seeks, but I did not find it objectionable for the amount of time
	   I was with the game (about 40 minutes).

	8. In normal game play, if you get killed you go on to the next scene. 
	   In the unlimited-lives-mode, if you get killed you start that
	   same scene over, presumably so you can figure it out.
	   interface 

	9. The production values of the animation are high quality, but

Re: Game Serial Communication
Dt: 7/13/83


If we can run the serial communications at 19.2 KBaud,

19.2 KBaud/11 bits= 1750 bytes/sec, not including housekeeping.

Assume 1000 bytes/sec.

If the update rate is 50 mS,

1000 bytes/sec * 50 mS = 50 bytes of communications/ update.

Using a straightforward approach, nothing fancy,

	the player's unit vectors = 9 words * 2 bytes = 18 bytes

	the player's position     = 3 words * 2 bytes =  6 bytes

	fire button, collision detects,etc	      = 10 bytes, max

						______________________

						     = 34 bytes


The serial I/O will be done by one of the Pokeys on each game's Sound Board.
Each game can receive and send simultaneously.

Re: Star Wars Description

Specifically:

	1. The game can produce 7 colours with 255 levels of brightness.
	2. The game uses:
		One 68B09E Game CPU. 
		One 68B09E Sound CPU.
		One Custom MSI 3D Math Processor.
		One Custom MSI Display List Processor.
	3. There are 12K bytes of Vector Display RAM (and 4K bytes of 
	   Vector Display ROM).
	4. I do not know what the highest score achieved in the marketplace or
	   in-house is.

Technically:

	The hardware is on three boards: the AVG Board, the Main Board, and 
the Sound Board. 

	The AVG Board contains the Analog Vector Generator which draws 
the lines on the screen. It has 12K bytes of Vector RAM and 4K bytes of 
Vector ROM. 

	The Main Board contains the 68B09E Game Processor, 48K bytes of 
Program ROM, 2K bytes of Program RAM, option switches, means for reading 
control panel switches and pots, a pseudo-random number generator, a digital 
Divider, and a Matrix Processor which performs the math for the 3D graphics. 

	The Sound Board contains a 68B09E, 16K bytes ROM (for the program, 
sound tables, and speech vocabulary), a 6532A (with 128 bytes of RAM, 
two bidirectionmal I/O ports, and an interrupt timer), 2K RAM, a speech 
synthesizer, four Atari Custom Sound ICs, a stereo image synthesizer 
and an interface to the Main Board.

	Self-Test (selected by the Self-Test switch on the operator panel)
tests as much of the hardware as possible. There is also a hardware diagnostic
mode which permits the repair technician to select specific routines to aid in
troubleshooting.

Additionally, kindly tell Lyle:
		1. I do not use Bit Slices in Star Wars.
		2. I DO NOT use Bit Slices in Star Wars.
		3. I DO NOT USE BIT SLICES IN STAR WARS.

Re: Star Wars Power Supplies
Dt: 7/26/83


	Two Star Wars production power supplies were brought to me to find out
why they did not work; even with no load they got really hot.

	In the unit I have tagged as #1, the transformer harness going to
J3 (the voltage selection connector) has the Red/Black and Brown/Black
wires reversed so that J3 pin 1 and pin 2 are reversed. This was verified
by an ohmmeter check. With the 120VAC voltage selection block in place
the result is effectively that part of the primary winding is shorted.

	In unit #2, the wire colors are correct, but an ohmmeter check
reveals that J3 pin 1 and pin 2 are reversed. Thus, the problem is a
wiring error inside the transformer. 

	An additional problem with unit #2 is that the mounting bracket 
for C1 (the 27,000 uF filter capacitor) has been tightened so much that 
a section of the capacitor has been caught in the clamp and bent. This
is not nice.

	Both of these units use Ravenswood tranformers. I am concerned
that because the transformer stack height is so short these units may not 
meet the specifications for Color X-Y transformers. I would like a 
production Color XY Power Supply in order to test the transformer temperature
rise in a Star Wars Game, and I would also like Components to perform a full
test on one.

Re: Star Wars RAMs at 5F, 5H
Dt: 8/25/83

Summary: On the boards that I received, the problem with the RAMs at 
5F and 5H were all solved by connecting a 180 Ohm 1/4 Watt 5% 
carbon film resistor from 9D pin 2 to ground. There is a 
convenient trace on the top of the board to attach it to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
On Tuesday, August 23, Mike Laschinger told me about the problem
they have started having with the Star Wars RAMs in locations
5F and 5H. These RAMs are used by the Matrix Processor.

My understanding is that in about 10 percent of the boards, Self-
Test says that the RAMs at 5F and 5H are bad, but in most cases
the game runs ok.

Changing the RAMs sometimes fixes it and sometimes does not.

This problem coincides with the introduction of the REV C boards.
Mike took some RAMs that failed Self-Test in a REV C board and
put them into a REV B board and apparently they worked.

I asked for a sample bad board and an unstuffed REV C board and 
received it on Wednesday. On the board I received, 5F and 5H failed 
during Self-Test and the game didn't work. On Wednesday I did some 
tests but didn't get anywhere.

On Thursday I had Erik put it on a development system and I tried 
some things. On Thursday afternoon I got Greg and Norman involved.

The RAM test worked when the program was running on the development
system, but not with the board stand-alone. While running hardware 
diagnostics I discovered glitches on the WP strobe in the Matrix
Processor clock generator, which went away when I put a 'scope probe
on the 12 MHz clock input at the LS161 at 9D pin 2. It appears that
the noise and glitches on 12 MHz (at the end of the line) were
screwing up the Matrix Processor clock and probably causing it to
extraneously access memory.

On the boards that I received, the problem with the RAMs at 5F and 5H 
were all solved by connecting a 180 Ohm 1/4 Watt 5% carbon film resistor 
from 9D pin 2 to ground. There is a convenient trace on the top of the 
board to attach it to.

I do not not know why this problem has suddenly appeared on REV C. We
did not change the circuitry connected to 12 MHz. Perhaps we are using 
a new batch of 74S04 inverters in the 12 MHz clock (at 1N).

Re: Stanford Instructional Network
Dt: 9/8/83


At your request on Tuesday I went with Herb to the meeting concerning the 
Stanford Instructional Network.

The situation is that another department has signed up for the service
and paid the $5K or so for a one year trial.

The problems are:

	1. The equipment costs $14K.

	2. We would need to set up several classrooms (for which we have no 
	   space).

	3. The fees are enormous: Honors Coop Program 	  $419/unit
				  Non-Registered Option   $229/unit
				  Audit Option		  $78/unit

	   The feeling at the meeting was that managers might not realize
	   that the fees had to come from their OWN department's education
	   budgets and that very few managers had an education budget large 
	   enough to support the potential demand.

	4. The Autumn Quarter starts September 28. Stanford has kindly
	   extended the registration deadline for Atari to Sept 13.

		The Honors Coop Program is for full credit toward an
		advanced degree. It requires formal admission to the
		Stanford graduate school, which requires a transcript
		and taking the GRE. It is unlikely that anyone starting 
		now could make the deadline.

		For the Non-Registered-Option students must still submit
		transcripts, but do not need the GRE. Students take all
		the exams and receive grades. Up to 18 credits can be
		transferred to the Honors Coops Program (if the student
		manages to get admitted to the program). It would be
		difficult to be admitted to the Non-Registered-Option
		at this late date unless the enrollee happens to have
		a transcript lying around. And had a 3.2 (or better) 
		Grade Point Average. 

  		The Audit Option requires no qualifications, no homework
		or exams, and no credt.

		A group in 1196 is buying the equipment. If we wanted
		to set up a unit here, we might not be able to get it
		installed in time. 


I have a copy of the course descriptions if you want to see it.


This could have been a good idea if it had been better organized.

Re: Another Idea
Dt: 9/13/83


I think there might be a large market for a new personal computer
designed around the NTSC interface.

It would have:

	16032 or 68000 processor
	[with an additional 6502 perhaps it could be made compatible with 
	existing Atari 800 software]

	256K byte (or more) RAM

	Slots for ROM cartridges

	Disk (memory) interface [maybe for hard disk]

	Peripheral interface

	NTSC interface

If video disc games are going to be popular as coin-op games, they will also 
be popular for home units.

The NTSC interface will also allow game video to be mixed with the output
from a standard consumer camera. This might allow some kind of innovative
game as well as serve as an extremely versatile titling generator. 

It is this last capability that would have the greatest appeal. People
would have at their disposal all of the advanced editing and storage 
(as well as advanced graphics) of the computer.

Re: Latest Star Wars Problem
Dt: 9/16/83


On Thursday (9/15/83) Mike Laschinger gave me a board set that was
representative of a problem that they have started to notice in
Production. The symptom is that sometimes after power-up, the game 
comes up with no stars. The game plays; there just are no stars.

We were not able to make the problem appear on our test setup. We
took the board set back to Production and put it on a CTS fixture
and the problem did appear. (Unfortunately, Mike says it sometimes
happens in assembled games.)

The reason there were no stars was that the Pseudo-Random-Number Generator
(ICs 4D, 5B, 5C, 5D) had gotten hung up in the invalid state of all
ONES. 

The Pseudo-Random-Number Generator has a CLEAR input which is cleared
during RESET (both power-up and Watchdog Reset) and which is also 
under program control.

I don't know why it sometimes fails to clear during power-up, but when
I put the circuit in, I told Greg to do a software clear at the beginning of 
each game. Instead, he does a software check which is supposed to reset
the Pseudo-Random-Number Generator if two consecutive numbers are the
same. Due to a coding error, this feature does not work.

On Friday, Mike's board set exibited the problem in the lab. Once.

I talked to Frank Becker and he said it hasn't been a significant
problem, yet.

There are several options:

	1. Find out why the Pseudo-Random-Number Generator sometimes fails
	   to be cleared during a power-on Reset. (A manual Reset does 
	   clear it.)
	2. Suggest a hardware fix involving cutting a trace and adding a
	   jumper.
	3. Release a new ROM set with the bug fixed, and send out a technical 
	   note to the operators.
	4. Do nothing.
 

How do you want me to spend my time?

Re: TI Speech Synthesizer Problems
Dt: 9/27/83


On Friday, Sept 16, I spoke to Keith Barber from TI Marketing and Dave
Watkins from TI Qualtity Control about the potential problems with the 
TMS-5220 Speech Synthesizer IC used in the Star Wars game.  

Their story is as follows:  

	1. They were doing some tests on the TMS-5220s and found that after
1000 hours at 85 degrees Celsius and 85% Relative Humidity some of the
parts exhibited a certain amount of noisiness and raspiness that was
not supposed to be present. 

	2. They have developed a test to screen for this problem. Tested
parts go into BIN #1, BIN #2, or BIN #3.

	3. They expect 2% - 4% of the ICs to have this problem.

I asked them some questions which they were totally unable (or unwilling) 
to answer:

	1. Are 2% - 4% bad before selection, or afterwards?

	2. Will this problem crop up in the 10K we have already used? 

I asked them to send me some "bad" parts so I could judge for myself
the extent of the problem. 

It seemed that the "real" QC engineer was on jury duty that week but he
would call on Monday (6/19) and they would send me some "bad" parts by
Federal Express.

By the end of that week I hadn't received anything so I called Iraj.
Finally, On Monday 9/26, I received some "bad" parts, but no phone call.

I compared the "bad" parts with a known good part. Of the two "bad"
parts, one was noticeably worse than the other, sounding like a
worn out record or perhaps a speaker with a torn cone. However,
I do not believe that an average player will notice the difference,
especially with the game playing, and especially in a typical arcade.

Rick Moncrief and Earl Vickers were present and agreed with this conclusion.

I want to emphasize that these were only two parts and were at room 
temperature. Perhaps it gets worse inside a game. Perhaps these were the 
"best" of the "bad" parts. If the ICs were any worse than the ones I heard, 
I would not approve their use in a game, especially since we are paying
for good parts. I would like them to answer my original questions. 


If they continue to pull this kind of crap, perhaps we should look
for another speech synthesizer.

Re: Speech Recognition Demo
Dt: 10/3/83


Cynthia Petroka and I went to the Demo at 1272 Borregas to see the
Dragon speech recognition system. The company is named Dragon Systems
and the gentleman who gave the demo (whose name I did not get) was 
formerly with Verbex. It seems that he and his associates have developed 
some new and very efficient speech recognition algorithms tailored to 
run on an 8 bit microcomputer, specifically a 2 MHz 6502.

The demonstration was given on a 1 MHz Apple II which is the reason he
gave for why some of the features had been removed.

Cynthia thinks that the vocabulary had been chosen to make the system
look good, and I agree. Nevertheless the demonstration was very impressive. 
Even though it was set up in the speaker dependent mode it was very successful 
in recognizing other speakers. He trained the system to recognize a new
vocabulary but by then it was very late and Cynthia and I had to leave. 

Dragon Systems is set up to do R & D and they have no plans to market
the device (algorithms) themselves. I do not know how much they want for
it or what kind of business arrangement they are interested in. I expect
that Steve Bristow and Ted Hoff will know. (They were both responsible
for the meeting.)

If we were to use it in a coin-op game it would require a dedicated
6502 (2 MHz), 1K RAM, 24K ROM, a microphone, a preamp, an A/D Converter,
and a game interface. This would provide for a 16 word vocabulary with
speaker independence. The estimated cost for developing the data base for
a speaker independent vocabulary is $10K/word. 

	The major problems in using speech recognition in a coin-operated 
game remain:

	1. Can it be sufficiently speaker independent with high enough 
	   accuracy? Will it still work when the player is excited?

	2. Can a way be developed to provide sufficient signal-to-noise 
	   for the players input? It may require that the cabinet be 
	   specifically designed around this requirement, such as with a 
	   totally enclosed game.   

	3. Can speech recognition be used effectively in a game?  Cynthia 
	   had a good idea. It could be used for controls that are used 
	   infrequently, like the shield button on Alpha One (Tollian Web).

	4. Does anyone want to use speech recognition in a game?  When I 
	   asked, last spring, people were basically indifferent to the idea.

Re: Manufacturing's Dual Audio Regulator Board Proposal
Dt: 10/20/83


The following concerns Manufacturing's memo of 9/29/83 "Dual Audio Regulator 
Board Proposal".


SUMMARY: The Audio/Regulator II series was designed to meet rather rigorous 
	specifications so that it would work in a wide variety of product. 
	What they want to do would probably work, but would work only with 
	Pole Position. This would mean maintaining additional inventory in 
	Manufacturing, Customer Service, and in the Field. Atari has 
	traditionally put a high premium on standard componants. 

	We should not design new, nonstandard Audio/Regulator boards for 
	each project.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is not clear from their proposal exactly what they mean to do and how
they mean to do it. 

	1. They state that "some games require more audio power than our
	current 'universal layout' can provide.

		A. This is debatable, as previous studies have demonstrated
		that the way the cabinet is designed is much more important
		to the loudness of the game than is the power of the audio
		amplifiers. In fact, with a poorly designed cabinet (that is,
		acousatically) even 100 watts would not be enough.
 
		B. Are they proposing to increase the power of the existing 
		amplifiers? If so, how?

		C. Are they adding more amplifiers to the board?

	2. They state that Pole Position, Ice World, and Firefox require
	two Regulator/Audio II - 01 boards which use 67% of the PC board
	and 50% of the heatsink. 
	
		A. If the empty board space on the A/R II-01 bothers
		people, they can use the A/R I which is electrically
		equivalent but shorter physically. In the past we have
		used A/R II in its various configurations because
		the A/R II -02 can be used as a replacement for all the
		other dash numbers in the A/R II series, simplifying
		spare parts inventory for the operators, distributors,
		and for ourselves.

		B. Pole Position did use two Audio/Regulator II-01s but
		Ice World (now called something else) will use two
		Audio/Regulator I boards. Firefox is scheduled to use the 
		Switcher, besides which	it requires +/- 22 volts and would 
		not use the A/R II-01, anyway. 
		
		C. Their estimate that the A/R II-01 uses only 50% of
		the heatsink may be correct from a visual standpoint
		but is thermally incorrect. 

		   The major source of heat is the 5 volt regulator which 
		may dissipate as much as (11.5 - 5) Volts * 6 Amps = 39 Watts. 
		(If the 10.3 V is not loaded to a total of 8 Amps it tends
		to be closer to 11.5 Volts.)
		
		   The +12 volt regulator dissipates a maximum of about 4 
		Watts and the -5 volt regulator adds about another 4 Watts 
		maximum. (Actually the -5 volt supply has not been loaded
		this much since we stopped using the 3 supply dynamic
		RAMs).  

		   The TDA2002 amplifiers probably average 1.5 Watts each 
		when they are both used. (The audio power delivered to the 
		speakers when averaged over times of 5 minutes is small 
		compare to peak power during parts of game play.) 

		   Therefore, when everything is fully loaded,  the 5 volt 
		regulator contributes 39 watts out of  50 Watts for 78%
		of the heat.

	3. They state that a prototype was developed and tested. Is this 
	what the drawing in the memo is of? (It shows two amplifiers
	and two 5 Volt regulators). What is the extra heat sink that they are
	referring to? Does the 2N3055 "surface" mean the "case" ?

	4. The test they conducted is inadequate for two reasons:

		A. They don't say what the game installation temperature
		was. We spec games to operate at an installation temperature
		of 38 degrees Celsius. If the game was tested at 24 deg.C
		(75 deg F.) you must add (38 - 24) = 14 deg C. to all the
		readings to find what the maximum temperature could be. 
		Still, when this is done, the temperatures they report
		would be acceptable. 

		B. The A/R II was designed to meet rather rigorous 
		specifications so that it would work in a wide variety
		of product. What they want to do would probably work, 
		but would work only with Pole Position. This would
		mean maintaining additional inventory in Manufacturing,
		Customer Service, and in the Field. Atari has traditionally
		put a high premium on standard componants. 

			We formerly had a transformer that was designed to 
		operate only on	120 VAC (The old Domestic Transformer). A 
		power base using one of these beauties saved about $4 over
		one using the International Transformer which had the taps to
		operate at 100, 120, 220, and 240 VAC. Atari did not want
		to maintain the additional inventory, with the result that
		now all of our power transformers are International.

			We should not design new, nonstandard Audio/Regulator
		boards for each project.

	(Aren't these the same people who want to have a standard cabinet?)


	5. The Audio/Regulator II is already beyond the point at which linear
	supplies are cost effective. That is why the Switching Power supply
	has been developed.

Re: Linear Power Supply for Firefox
Dt: 11/15/83


The only game currently running stand-alone is the one that went to the
Show and is now in the Shield Room. They do not have one upstairs that
is running stand-alone.

The total current in this unit on the 5 Volt supply was measured to be 
7.2 Amps. We were not able to measure the boards separately but I doubt 
that one board is drawing more than 6 Amps. 

If this is representative of the game, then we can run it with one 
power tray (with an extra capacitor as in Pole Position) and two
Audio Regulator II boards. Otherwise it will require two power trays.

However, the hardware is said to be still changing. They expect to remove 
some memory and that should decrease the current. If they get below 6 Amps, 
then only one Audio Regulator II would be required. (I think this is unlikely 
with their hardware.)


Assuming that they will require two Audio Regulator II boards, the following 
things should be done to ensure that Firefox can be used with the Linear 
Power Supply:

	1. The +5 Volt supply should be brought onto J20 as two separate
	sections, each with a +5 Volt Sense line. 

	2. These two sections must be run separately to the Main and Graphics
	PCBs (and kept separate).

	3. Do Not Daisy Chain the Power Lines.

	4. The 5 Volt return lines (and their sense lines) should all be 
	connected together on the Video PCB, unless someone can figure
	out a reason for doing it some other way.

When the Switching Power Supply is used, the two 5 Volt sections will
be connected together.

	5. The Reset circuit must be able to work with either Switching
	or Linear supplies. Sam Ly said he has a circuit for this.

	6. A way must be figured out so the PC boards will work with
	either  +22,-22 unregulated (The Linear Supply) or +15, -31 
	(the Switcher).	We may have to change one or two resistors on
	Game boards that are used with a Linear Supply.   

I expect that the sitdown and upright versions with the Linear supply will
require separate FCC testing and UL investigation. That means building
upright and sitdown prototypes. 

Will the games need different model numbers to differentiate them?
