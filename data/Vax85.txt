Subj:	Printer in Rains's area


There is another printer hooked up now in the phone closet near Rains's office.
It's known as RAINS$PRINT and if you want it to be the default printer for you
then put the following in your LOGIN.COM file:

	$ ASS 'f$log("RAINS$PRINT")' SYS$PRINT

The physical name is TXD5:, but I advise against using that name cuz its
probably gonna change (nothing stays the same around here if you hadn't
noticed). This printer is quite a bit slower than the others but it may
still be preferable to walking over to the hot DIO room.

It is imperative that you keep the room tidy. Paper fragments must be kept
outside the room and due to the fragile nature of the telephone hookups,
please be careful when walking around in there. An accident could wipe
out the phones in that area for several days (maybe even weeks) which I
think you'd find very inconvenient.

Subj:	Just when you were getting used to the way it worked...


    Due to popular demand, the utilities MAIDIR and MAILCK have been
enhanced.  This is a major release (rewritten from scratch), and probably
has brand new bugs.

    As far as I know, the current usage is not affected at all (total
upwards compatibility), unless you have one mail file in particular
(DIR.MAI).

    Here's how to use the new stuff:

    In your LOGIN.COM file, you say
    	$MAI*L :== @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]MAIDIR
and from that time forth, when you invoke mail, a file (WAS MAIL.RVN,
NOW DIR.MAI) is created which indicates the time you exited.  Under the
new version, the contents of this file is a directory of SYS$LOGIN:*.MAI;,
so you can READ DIR to find out what categories you have filed stuff under.

    Somewhere AFTER the first definition (in your LOGIN.COM file), say:
    	$ @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]MAILCK
to automatically enter MAIL if you have received mail since you last exited
the MAIL program.  Note that it is possible to exit the program without reading
all your new mail, so it is conceivable to have new mail and not auto-invoke
MAIL.  But if this happens, you set it up that way, presumably on purpose.
You have not received any mail since you last exited MAIL.

    The really neat part is that you can also (or instead) say:
    	$ @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]MAILCK device/directory_spec
to check for new mail on other logins.  This even works across the network,
although you may find the time required for access to be restrictive.  You
might define the @...MAILCK part to be a word, and then CHECK [so-and-so]
interactively.  You can find out if the other accounts have mail, but
it is not possible to read their mail (don't bother), so you are simply
notified that there is "New mail in what-you-said".  It's up to you to
log in with your other account and read the mail.

    Incidentally, the DIR mail file will contain the directory as of the
last time you exited MAIL.  If you delete or rename files using DCL, these
changes won't be seen until you exit mail again.  The DIR file also does not
have the standard MAIL format (FROM and TO lines are missing) so a MAIL
DIRECTORY command will blow up (not my fault!).  Take my word for it, there
is only one message in the file.  I do not reccommend FILEing that message
anywhere.

    Another fine point:  the MAIDIR command procedure takes an optional
parameter.  If it is absent, the DIR.MAI file will be typed out before
the first MAIL prompt--this shows you where you have things FILEd.  If this
bothers you, you can supply anything for the first parameter, and it will
be skipped.  I reccommend "-Q" in case of further changes.  This is not
a change from the older version, and your LOGIN.COM definitions will work
the same way as they have in the past.

    If you find that the changes I have made make you unable to use MAIL,
please send me a mail message describing the problem.  Have fun, and good luck.

Subj:	The new, but not improved, mail checker


	There are some problems with the new mail checker.  It works
fine in the applications it used to be used in; the (known) problems
are all in the enhancements.

	To start with, when you check someone elses mail file, you have
to have read access in order to find out the attributes (date of last
modification is an attribute).  So, you need to change the protection
on your mail file in order for that to work--and then anyone can read
your mail.  I think that's icky.

	Then, for CHECKs across the network, DCL doesn't close the channels
used to obtain the information about the file--so you wind up with 4
jobs started on the other node.  This is a somewhat excessive overhead.
These jobs stick around till you log off.

	Lastly, if circumstances are "right" (don't ask, I don't know
for sure myself) you can get an RMS error, Dynamic Memory Exhausted.  I
checked into that and the suggested cure is to relink the program so
that the control area is bigger.  The program I'm using is DCL, and I'm
not that eager to replace the current version.

	None of this happens if you are checking your own mail (which is
all it used to do).  I haven't decided whether or not to fix it, cuz of
version 4 coming up (mail is different in V4...you will get a { L O N G }
list of changes for V4 soon {maybe eventually, anyway}).  It seems that
the cure is to write a quick and dirty (or time-consuming and correct)
program to do the checks and return a status.

	Sorry for the false alarm, but I'm sure somebody with a dirty
mind once said it: Hope springs eternal in the human breast.  Don't let
it get you down.

Subj:	mail reading


for those of us usually on CHARM:
  you can use the aforementioned MAIL CHECK routine IF you do a kludge in
your LOGIN.COM on KIM.  If you add 

$SET PROT=W:RE DIR.MAI

then CHARM::[WHATEVER] will be able to check your mail.

Subj:	the problem with kludges

- by the way, It doesn't do it in a very elegant way:  if you DO get
new mail, you get an error message

%SYSTEM-F-NOPRIV, no privilege for attempted operation

And if you've read all your mail, you don't get the error.  Useful but UGLY.

Subj:	the patch to the kludge


The correction to the protection of the directory file ($SET PROT=W:RE DIR.MAI)
is indeed necessary to avoid a privilege violation.  Unfortunately, the
same kludge is necessary to the MAIL.MAI file, and I think the system
resets the protection if new mail is received.  I could have stuck these
commands in the file that creates DIR.MAI but I expected to get a lot
of flak for making your mail publicly accessible without telling you.
Also, I'm pretty sure the system will change the protection back, so
the error wouldn't go away.  And on top of that, there is still the
problem of the 4 processes (per $CHECK) that are created on the remote
node.

Public opinion poll:  How many people (not accounts, PEOPLE) would use
CHECK if it worked as intended?  That is to say, if it didn't blow up,
didn't advertise your mail, and also didn't use up multiple job slots
forever?

How many would use it if I couldn't avoid the advertising?

Please respond to KIM::SUTTLES.

Some of you may have noticed the presence of files in your home directory
with the name MAIL$nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.MAI where the "n" is a arbitrary number.
These files are created when your mail message is greater than 3 disk blocks
(1500 bytes) in length. There's one file for each of your long messages. You can
make MAIL put these files in a different directory if you want by issuing the
command:

	MAIL> SET MAIL_DIRECTORY [.sub_directory_name]

where the [.sub_directory_name] is one of your choosing. For example:

	MAIL> SET MAIL_DIRECTORY [.MAIL]

will put "folder" files in the subdirectory [.MAIL] and out of your way.

Subj:	A Fond Farewell


Dear Friends,

The time has come for me to move on. The two years I have spent with you have
been educational, challenging, and enjoyable. My reasons for leaving are
varied, and are directly related to the recent re-organization. I would have
liked to stay, as I still think I can be challenged and the product is still
interesting, but the enjoyment is gone. 

Reflecting on the past two years makes me kind of sad to leave. The Atari
Coin-Op atmosphere was really radical for me at first, but it is an easy thing
to get used to. John Ray was an excellent supervisor. The people are very
talented and inspired. The product is fascinating, and has nothing to do with
the DOD. I really enjoyed this stimulating environment. 

The job of Team Manager was a great experience for me, also. We worked on
several exciting projects including MACHO44, FIREFOX, CRYSTAL CASTLES, and of
course, SPOOK. We were breaking new ground with that one. I was real excited
with our version of EVOLUTION, also. The work of game design is a really
creative process, something I don't feel as much when I design hardware.
Designing hardware is like looking for the answer to a question. When the
answer comes, it feels like the answer was always there, and your work was
spent in just discovering this existing information. Of course, there may be
several answers to the same question, and discovering the best one is what
differentiates engineers. 

Game design is a little more non-tangible. I still don't have a feeling for
what makes a good game. Past versions of Gremlins indicate this fact very
effectively. I really hope that Gremlins receives the attention it deserves
from management as the next System II game. I'm sure that the current project
team has the ability to pull it off. 

I believe that we cannot interact with someone without affecting the future
course of their lives. My time here at Atari has affected me greatly, some
positive, some negative. Here's hoping that I only touched you in a positive
way. My last day is 2/15. 

Goodby. 

Ross Cox (xxx)-xxx-xxxx

Subj:	documentation on version 4 differences (such that it is)


    There is a document (a LARGE document) in SYS$LIBRARY:VMSV4.DAT
which is supposed to outline the areas in VMS that is different between
version 3 systems and version 4 systems.

    It is not finished.  (If you read it, this will be obvious.)  We are
still working on it in our spare time (I'm serious).  Because of it's size,
I ask that you do NOT copy the file anywhere;  to look through it with
an editor, use EDT/READ and you can do anything you want (search, etc).
You can print it, but you probably won't want to until it is more complete.

    It only exists on kim and charm, since they are the only V4 systems.
It will be updated as new chapters are finished.  You will get announcements
of same when same is announceable.  And if you think this is hard to
follow, just wait till you read the update descriptions.

    Incidentally, there are two tables of contents;  one that shows the
general outline, and one that is much more specific (hence longer).  I
intend to provide an index (eventually) but I am saving that for when the
text is finished.

    Bug reports and typo detections are encouraged.  Please reply to this
address via vaxmail (only).

Subj:	New 68000 assmebler


	There is a new assembler for the 68000. This assembler is 4 times
    faster than asm68. Part of the reason this assembler is so fast is
    because it is limited in what input it will accept. The only legal
    inputs are the output files from the Greenhill C compiler. Any other
    inputs and the results are not guaranteed. This assembler should be
    used to assemble Greenhill compiled programs only!!!! If you have
    assembly language programs for the 68000, PLEASE use asm68.

    	This assembler does NOT support:
	    Error checking of syntax or addressing modes.
	    Complex expressions in an effective address.
	    The * operator in an addressing mode.
	    MACROs in any way shape or form.
	    The short form of a register list for MOVEM.
	        D1-D3/A1-A3
	    	must be written:
	    	D1/D2/D3/A1/A2/A3
	    ORG or RORG, TTL or any other pseudo-op that
	    	Greenhill does not generate.
    	In other words, if Greenhill didn't generate it, this assembler
    probably doesn't understand it.
    	
    	The output of the assembler is compatable with clnk. It does
    take about 10-15% longer to link files generated by this assembler.

    	On the good side, This assembler is about 4-5 times faster than asm68.
    It should be look at as a second pass to the Greenhill compiler. In which
    case, your compiles will take about 50% longer but you can skip the
    assembly step. I recommend that a command file be created of the form:

    $NCC-R 'P1'
    $AS68K 'P1'
    $DEL 'P1'.ASM;*

    This way your directory doesn't get cluttered up with .asm files that
    are never reused. The compiler is then viewed as generating an .ol
    file instead of a .asm file.

    The name of the assembler is AS68K. It is a command on both kim and
    charm. The command syntax is:

    $as68k infile.asm outfile.ol

    It is not necessary to specify the extension on the input file.
    .asm is assummed.
    It is not necessary to specify the output file.
    infile.ol is assumed.

Subj:	New Fortran

Kim has a new Fortran compiler and RTL. The compiler is a little slower to
compile (taking between 10-25% longer) but is supposed to produce much faster
executable images. The compiler is 3 times bigger so it needs 3 times as
much memory to run without page faulting itself to death. Come and see me
if you plan on using this compiler often.

Subj:	MAILCK and MAIDIR for version 4 MAIL


    Good news and bad news.

    The good news:
    	MAILCK and MAIDIR have been updated to make more sense with VMS V4.

    The bad news:
    	They only work as good as before (no known bugs fixed...network
access still is not feasible).

    It now uses the logical name MAIL$LOGIN as the default for where to
look instead of SYS$LOGIN.  MAIL$LOGIN will translate to SYS$LOGIN if you
don't override it.  If you told mail to SET MAIL_DIRECTORY somewhere-else,
you broke MAILCK.  Here's how to fix it:

    In your LOGIN.COM, before you use either MAILCK or MAIDIR, do
    	$ ASSIGN SYS$USERDISK:[username.maildir] MAIL$LOGIN:
where [username.maildir] is where you told MAIL to put your stuff.

    You can delete the old DIR.MAI file in SYS$LOGIN.

    There aren't any new features other than that.  If you try to tell
mailck to check ANYWHERE IN PARTICULAR, it knows you are looking to see
if another user (your pen name maybe?) got mail, and that you can't
read it.  So it won't even try.  The logical name (mail$login) is the
only way to get MAILCK to automatically invoke mail.  Incidentally,
if you want to check your own mail, but don't want to automatically
invoke it, do a $CHECK MAIL$LOGIN: and it will just announce that you
have new mail (but VMS does that already).

    To recap how to use them:  (my mail directory is [SUTTLES.MAIL])
    	$ ASSIGN SYS$USERDISK:[SUTTLES.MAIL] MAIL$LOGIN:
    	$ MAI*L :== @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]MAIDIR
    	$ CHECK :== @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]MAILCK
    	$ CHECK		! go into mail if I have any
    	$ CHECK SYS$USERDISK:[SHEPPERD.MAIL]	! spy on my boss
    	$ CHECK SYS$USERDISK:[OBRIEN.JUNK]	! her mail is in this directory
    Remember you have to know where they set their MAIL_DIRECTORY to.

Due to popular demand you can now put comments in .LNK files. They won't
however appear on your link map (sorry about that). The /C (continue option)
is optional and no longer required (it won't bomb anymore if you put a /C
on the last line either). The comments are delimited with an exclamation mark
and everything to the right of the mark is assumed to be a comment.

Tabs are equivalent to spaces. Blank lines are permitted anywhere in the file.

	! This is an example of a .LNK file
	file1,file2,file3	!comments
				!more comments
	!still more comments
	file3,file4		!tabs are the same as spaces
		(blank lines are ok too)
		!the "!" doesn't have to be first on the line

	    file5,file6		!filenames don't have to begin in col 1

There can't be any spaces BETWEEN filenames (file1,file2,... is ok but
file1, file2, ... is not ok) but there can be spaces or tabs in front of
the first name and behind the last name. The comments will not appear on the
link map (sorry about that), but you can't have everything. The /C at the end
of the line is optional. There can be any number of filenames on a line
seperated with comma's but the names can still be no longer than 6 chars.

Since there seems to be a tradition of goodbye speeches via VAXMAIL
at ATARI, I too will bid you all a fond farewell this way. As a 
matter of fact, VAXMAIL is going to be one of the things I'll miss
a lot when I'm no longer at ATARI; this is the neatest thing since
CB radio for instant dissemination of juicy news tidbits, soliciting
help for god-knows-what project...its even good for work-related stuff.

I've really enjoyed these last two years; I've gotten to work on a  
variety of interesting projects and to go places I've never been (like
Mexico City, Pajaro Dunes and Chicago.) I feel that I learned a little bit 
about computers and a lot about organization of information from the 
programmers and other animators I've worked with. My only real regret is 
that I can't stay long enough to see the projects I've put the most time 
into: PACKRAT, JAMMIN', and DUNGEONs, finished and selling like hotcakes.

I want especially to express my appreciation to Lyle Rains, whom I've enjoyed 
working for very much, for being so gracious about my leaving, and to Yoko
Takiyama, Chuck Swensen, Rich Moore, Peter Thompson, Robert Weatherby, and
Ed Logg, who could also have made me feel guilty but didn't! I'm going to
miss daily contact with them, as well as with my ex-cell-mate Barry, Susan Ginzu
McBear, Samwise Comstock, John B. & Dave P. (the rude boys,) Nill Woble, 
the Mikes, Janey-Sue, Stephanie, Cynthia, Carol, Cindy G. (Women of ATARI,
unite!) Mark (the little brother I never wanted), Jed, and ALL OF YOU except
the cafeteria. I won't miss the cafeteria. At all.

So I won't say "goodbye"; I'll just close by saying " you've always got a 
friend in the Magic Kingdom!"

Subj:	some new logical names and some heavy user stuff


    Hiya, VAX fans!

    At one time there was a cartoon posted in 1501 that read something like:
    	"First you set default SYS$USERDISK:, then you
    	type @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]NOLOG, then..."
Well, we SYS$MANAGER types resemble that remark.  So, we have an announcement:

    You can now use UTL$MAC: instead of SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES].
    You can now use UTL$COM: instead of SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM].
    You can now use UTL$EXE: instead of SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.EXE].
    These are on all 4 systems.  You may edit your com files to make them
shorter, or easier to read, or you may leave them alone, at your option.
We will use the new names in future announcements of new utilities (even used
ones) cuz they are easier for us to type, as well.

...and now....

    I dunno if any of you have felt as limited as I have by DCL's constant
refusal to believe in subroutines, but for those of you who have, there is:

    			HLLDCL!!!			(sorry, Greg)

    You can now include in your command files, the line:
    	$ @UTL$COM:HLLDCL		! (told ya!)
and you will have the symbols JSB, SUBR, and RSB defined.  I picked these names
so they wouldn't conflict with the GOSUB and RETURN command files of olden days.
You can also pick your own names, by specifying them in that order.  You MAY NOT
NEST routines called this way.  If you want to, you have to execute HLLDCL a
second time, and provide a whole new vocabulary to it, as in:
    	$ @UTL$COM:HLLDCL CALL ROUTINE RET

    To use these new words, you MUST enclose them in tic marks:
$! Assuming:				$! Assuming:
$!	$ @HLLDCL			$!	$ @HLLDCL CALL ROUTINE RET
$! then this is legal:			$! then this is legal:
$!	$ 'jsr' routine_name		$!	$ 'call' my_routine
$!	$ .				$!	$ .
$!	$ .				$!	$ .
$!	$ .				$!	$ .
$!	$ exit				$!	$ exit
$!	$				$!	$
$!	$routine_name: 'subr'		$!	$my_routine: 'routine'
$!	$ .				$!	$ .
$!	$ .				$!	$ .
$!	$ .				$!	$ .
$!	$ 'rsb'				$!	$ 'ret'

    Notice that the two examples use different vocabularies:  the first
allows the default vocabulary (identical to @HLLDCL JSR SUBR RSB) and the
second calls out different verbs to be defined.  Notice the tic marks!

    Because of the different vocabularies, ROUTINE_NAME may 'CALL' MY_ROUTINE
<OR>  MY_ROUTINE may 'JSR' ROUTINE_NAME, but not both (circular recursion).
You can multiply this technique to any practical limit.  Pairs must match
(in the examples, you must 'RSB' from a 'JSB' and 'RET' from a 'CALL').
The definition of the routine must also be from the same set (you must
'JSB' to a 'SUBR', not to a 'ROUTINE').

    Oh, yeah, the command file generates a label that is a 16-digit decimal
number that is supposed to be unique each time you execute it (it is built
from the current time of day in hundredths of seconds).  So, don't use any
16-digit numeric-only labels in the command procedures you wanna use HLLDCL
within.  (Is that a reasonable restriction??)

    The whole thing hinges on how DCL handles labels in command procedures,
and relies pretty heavily on symbol substitution (by the way, the symbols so
defined are defined as globals...they will live past the exit of your command
file, so don't use words like DIR or SET {you won't do it twice, anyways}).
The inner workings are kinda hard to explain, so I won't.  Rest easy, though,
the things it relies on are documented and therefore supported, so we can
complain to DEC if it breaks.

    Also, the whole thing is tested pretty thoroughly, cuz I couldn't believe
there really was a way to do what I wanted, that has been under my nose for
all this time.

    Have fun, and let me know if you have any problems (so I can avoid them).

Subj:	new as68k


There is a new version of as68k on both kim and charm. This fixes an
opscure local variable bug that I'm sure none of you have run into yet.
As68k also recognizes statements of the form:
	DC.B	'Hi there',10,'how are you'

This is new to as68k. Before it only would accept statements of the form:
	DC.B	'Hi there'
	or
	DC.B	10,20,$30

You can now mix constants with ascii strings. This helps with making
asciz strings. i.e.
	DC.B	'This is a test',0

If you have any problems, feel free to write or phone

Subj:	New Green Hills C compiler.


There is a new version of Green Hills C. This version generally produces
a little bit better code then the one were now using. There is an exception,
However, some subtraction expressions are worse. This is because the old version
was a little bit cavalier about lossing precision. The new version took an
overly cautious approach to the problem. There is supposed to be yet another
new version in a few weeks which does the right thing.
    Why get a new version when we are going to get a better one in a few
weeks? You may ask. Well, This version fixes a bug in pointer arithmetic that
allows you to link in external constants. This is of the form:
	extern SND1;
#define SOUND1 (byte)&SND1

The symbol SND1 is an external sound number generated and linked in.
This way you don't have to edit your .h file every time you get new
sounds. There is a bug in version 1.7.1 that prevents you from doing
this nice trick. The new version (1.7.6) fixes that.
 I've tried 1.7.6 and it seem to generate OK code. For all of My modules,
it was a little bit smaller. For a packrat module (Player.c) It was a
little bit bigger. In general, The code should be better with this new
version.

How do you get the new version?
Change the definition of NCC in your login.com file to:
NCC :== $sys$sysdevice:[green.1v7v8]cc68

If you have any problems with this new version, Contact Me asap.

Subj:	The fastest login in the west


Has anybody noticed that Kim is kinda S-L-O-W sometimes? This is actually due
to a couple of things: one is that that you guys are using Kim to do lots of
hard work (this is good, keep it up). The other is that VMS 4 and its
associated processes gobble up about 2Mb of memory out of an available total of
4. This is about 1000 pages more than under VMS 3 (once again proves that
software grows to fill the available space) and as a consequence, programs
running on Kim do a lot more page faulting. What's even worse is that most of
these additional page faults are "hard" in that they are resolved by disk
accesses. There is (or will be shortly) a document called DOK:PAGES.DOC that
describes in some detail how VMS manages its memory. Read it if you're
intrested. 

In the meantime you can take it on blind faith that Kim needs more memory to
reduce these page fault rates, which in turn will make it run faster. There are
two ways to achieve this goal, one by hardware and one by software. The
hardware solution costs about $40k (buy more memory) and there's no chance of
gettin that kind of money. The software solution is to reduce the demand on
Kim's memory. One can achieve this by restricting access (boo-hiss), kicking
off users (blech) or by having the users help VMS manage its memory. Its this
last method that I want to try so I've written up a little program to do just
that. You guys have to help out by getting into the habit of running this
program yourself. I've tried to make it as easy as possible for you to do this
by setting up all the VT100 type terminals for "applications keypad" and
defining the keypad 0 key to "RUN SLEEP". All you have to do is press the 0 key
on the keypad if you expect not to be doing any work at your terminal for
anywhere from a few seconds to several hours. To wake up your terminal again,
just type any key which can if fact be the first character of your next
command. For the blue box development system people, DOWNC automatically chains
to SLEEP at program termination. (For all those who have already defined their
keypad 0 key to mean something else, sorry about that, your definition wins so
you'll have to define some other key sequence to SLEEP. You can require that
your password be entered to "wake up" your terminal by running SLEEPWP which
is done easily by pressing the PF1 (gold) followed by the 0 key.

Please understand that you're not giving up anything in either performance or
functionality in doing this, it only improves system performance for everyone
by allowing programs to use more memory TEMPORARILY. You get back all the pages
you freed up (plus more if you need them) as soon as you "wake up". You may
think "Why should I give my pages? I want to keep them all!" Actually, if the
system gets real busy, it'll take ALL your pages away from you whether you are
sleeping or not. It is NOT possible to hoard pages. But by sleeping, you
volunteer your pages for somebody else saving the system the trouble of being
sneaky about taking them from you. Also, don't expect Kim to suddenly get 10
times faster. I realistically expect that it will change from S----L----O----W
to a mere S---L---O---W, but every little bit helps in this case.

As an added bonus, ZAP_THE_USER will leave your process alone if you are
running sleep and the process(es) sleeping with password won't get zapped at
23:30. You can use sleep with password in lieu of logging out, which makes
logging back in as fast as just typing your password. But please don't sleep
with password on public terminals since it will prevent users who don't know
your password from using them. You will notice that Sleep says who it's waiting
for, so if you inadvertantly lock up, say the VT100 in the DIO room, you will
surely be hunted down and set upon by an angry mob of users. Should you
find that you've done such a foul deed, SUICIDE from any other terminal will
quickly solve the problem. Lucky for us so far, we can correct such breaches of
honor by comitting SUICIDE with a few keystrokes at our terminal instead of the
more conventional everlasting method requiring the use of a blade.

Subj:	Due to public command, EDT.COM has (yet again) been changed...

    Last time I changed EDT.COM, I added some filespec defaulting, which
was, to say the least, not appreciated.  By most.  But some people want
the new way (oops).  So, here's the compromise.  Beleive it or not, it is
just as easy/hard for the system to do it this way as the other way;
I just didn't choose this way the first time.

    How it comes up with the filespec to edit is this:
    	First, it extracts the filespec you supplied, if any.
    	Next, it applies defaults from the global symbol USER$_FILE_DEFEXT.
This symbol might be set to ".MAC" or ".C" in your login.com file.
    	Next, it applies defaults from the global symbol EDT$MEMORY (if it
exists yet).
    	Then it extracts just the name and extension from the result and
makes that the new value of the global symbol EDT$MEMORY.
    	Finally, it invokes the editor on the fully-specified file (device
and directory too).

    So, if you want the default to ALWAYS be such-and-such, give that value
to USER$_FILE_DEFEXT.  If you want the default to be what it was last time,
leave USER$_FILE_DEFEXT undefined.  You can stick a filename in
USER$_FILE_DEFEXT if you want a default filename too, but this might
break other stuff.  For which I will take no responsibility.

    The advantage of all this noise is that if you use EDT.COM, you guarantee
that you won't step on anybody elses edit, unless they go out of their way
to fool EDT.COM, or you both start your edits more-or-less simultaneously
(on the order of a second or so apart).

    If there should be discovered a way to break this protection, PLEASE LET
ME KNOW since a fair number of people (you just wouldn't BELEIVE how many)
depend on this protection.

    FYI, here is the comment block at the beginning of the file which is
supposed to give an overview of the algorithm.

$! Apply filespec defaults:
$!	Take filespec user supplied (command line must first be parsed)
$!	Apply "''USER$_FILE_DEFEXT'" as default
$!	Apply "''EDT$MEMORY'" as default
$!	save resultant name and extension (only) as EDT$MEMORY
$! Check for other people editing same file:
$!	Determine journal filespec
$!	Check for journal file's existence
$!	if journal file is open, abort
$!	if not /RECOVER, abort
$! Select EDT initializer file:
$!	Select filename (EDTVT100, EDTVT52, or EDTINI)
$!	If file exists in UTL$COM:, select that
$!	If file exists in SYS$LOGIN:, select that
$!	If file exists in current default directory, select that
$! Invoke editor.

Subj:	EDT.COM again

	It has been pointed out that since I forced the journal file to be
created in the same directory as the file being edited, you can't
@EDT somebody else's file /READ cuz you can't create the journal file.

	So I changed it (surprise!).
\
	As of this morning, /READ will imply /NOJOURNAL.  If you want
a journal file with a /READ, use /READ/JOURNAL or /JOURNAL/READ (order
doesn't matter).  The location for the journal file will be your current
default directory.  Or you can specify a filename on the journal switch,
ie, /JOURNAL=SYS$LOGIN: or some such.

	Because the primary purpose of the com file is to provide protection
against two people in the same directory editing the same file, when you
use the com file and cause no journal file to be created (this is what it
checks for) a warning is printed on the terminal to let you know that you
should be careful.  This applies to the /READ qualifier as well.

	Contrary to popular opinion, the com file does NOT exist to generate
junk mail.  Just works out that way.

This is going to be rather long as I have spent 7 1/4 years here.  It
is time to say my farewells.  I leave in good company.
TO:  Dan Van (or Dan Ban Elderen)
     Who always aggravated me by asking the one question I didn't have
     an answer for; who after many years of teasing Taco, couldn't
     remember if Taco was Mexican or Japanese and had to ask me; and
     who affectionately called me "the little nipper". (It was meant
     to be affectionate, wasn't it?)

TO:  George Opperman (The Kraut):
     Who I constantly told if it hadn't been for the German's, we'd
     have won the war.  Georgie, you finally learned my name as Yoko
     and not Kyoko and now I am leaving.

TO:  Pete "Taco" Takaichi:
     Who when I first came to the company, in conversation, thought I
     was speaking Japanese to him when it actually was English - the
     word he misunderstood was "culture".  (Remember, Pete?)

TO:  Ricky Moncrief (Mr. Bedroom Eyes):
     Who in conversation always tried to embarrass me, but got
     embarrassed instead. (Carol and Carrie can attest to that.)
     Anyway try to be good.

TO:  Dave Sherman:
     Who supplied my little pudgy body with tea and cookies (and even
     sympathy when my dog died 6 years ago).

TO:  Mike Albaugh:
     Who gave me my U.S. Daily Requirement of hugs, some days in the
     past, it was the only gesture that kept me going.

TO:  Morgan Hoff:
     Who provided me with such "intellectual" entertainment any much
     more.

TO:  Dave Shepperd:
     Who I tried to emulate and who tried his very best to teach me
     to be a programmer when I grew up, and who always bailed me out
     when I screwed up my computer (which was often).

TO:  Rich Moore:
     Who was ever constant and positive in his attitude when things
     got bad.

TO:  Mike Mahar:
     Who never failed to stop by to say good morning and who functioned
     as my EDT instructor.

TO:  Susan McBride:
     Who made it her job to bother me at every opportunity but who made
     up for it by sharing with me her coffee ice cream. You always made
     me laugh.

TO:  Mary Johnson, Otto DeRuntz and Gerry Lichac:
     We've been to Adcotech, now Atari - we may be together again
     one day.  What company should I choose?

TO:  Carol Martinez:
     Who gave me a bad time at every opportunity and whom I will 
     always remember when I eat at Taco Bell.  You made my life a lot
     easier at times.

TO:  Erik Durfey:
     (Also known as my baby brother)  I won't be around for your
     birthday this time.  Have a Happy Birthday.  I still feel we look
     alike - we just got the "yellow" color reversed.  You have blond
     hair and I have yellow skin!    Love, Jen

TO:  Cyndy Grossman:
     Who's life I enjoyed being a part of and who saved my sanity many
     times over the last three years.

TO:  Lorie Carbello:
     Who I now, bequeath my son, please take care of him for me.

TO:  Wyle B. Wains:
     My son the engineer, Mr. Excitement, Hollywood Rains -
     We'll keep in touch you and I, but I feel you should know how truly
     grateful I was to work for you, with you, and sometimes even
     against you.  Both you and Atari afforded me great opportunities
     and personal growth.  I am forever in your debt.  To you a very
     fond goodbye.
     P.S.  I still feel the Decmation Word Processor cannot compare to
           the Wang.  I know, defiant until the end!  I never did
           learn to say your name either.

TO ALL THESE PEOPLE A SPECIAL THANK YOU.  TO THE REST OF ENGINEERING,
I THANK YOU AND WISH YOU ALL VERY WELL AND MUCH SUCCESS.  I HOPE I WILL
FIND A COMPANY WITH AT LEAST HALF OF THE KIND OF PEOPLE I HAVE MET HERE.
IT HAS TRULY BEEN A PLEASURE, NOT TO MENTION A DEFINITE EXPERIENCE.
			Warmest regards,   Yoko

of you who are left here to carry on. 

I hope to be enshrined in the Atari Hall of Fame for being laid off,
by the same group, twice in seven months. If not the Hall of Fame
then perhaps the Believe It Or Not.

See you all on the ski slopes, 

         Linda Sinkovic

Subj:	Why am I still here?


Well, it's cheerio from me.  No, this is not a breakfast cereal commercial - 
it's my way of saying goodbye.  I've really enjoyed working here at Atari 
and it's been a wonderful introduction to California and the U.S.A.


There's lots that I'm going to miss:

parties, doughnuts, Evolution, the Beermeister, Stubben's pipe, Drobney's 
mutterings, searching for coffee/sugar/cream in the mornings, rumors (they all 
seem to be true!), moving office regularly, finding photocopiers that work, 
"now you have a friend in the paper business" every five minutes, dodging 
falling (asbestos?) ceiling tiles, Vax mail, cafeteria tables, Mario Brothers 
and the best bunch of foreigners this side of London!


Here's the catch - I'm not going just yet.  Since my status in the U.S. is 
questionable without Atari's employment, Atari have been decent enough to 
keep me on until I get my green card (permanent residence visa) which should be 
in about a month or so's time.

So there's plenty of time for you all to say goodbye to me (via Vax mail if 
you like).  Good luck for the future.

                          Cheerio,

                        Paul Watmore

Subj:	Sound Pong


			PONG - THE AUDIO GAME

	This is a 1- or 2-player game, which uses the bat ranging
circuit for the controllers (designed into ping-pong paddles), and
an audio motion object circuit with headphones.  There would be a
very small ping-pong looking table (foosball sized or smaller), with the
paddles on relatively short and destruction-resistant cables.  At the
beginning of the game the players are given various choices by voice
synthesis.  Choices such as difficulty of game and headphone loudness 
are made by raising and lowering the paddles. 

	1) Type of game

		A.) Competitive ping-pong
		B.) Cooperative ping-pong (joint score, object
			being to keep the ball in play for as long
			as possible)
		C.) Juggling? (with 1-4 objects)
		D.) Other variants


	2) Type of motion object

		A) Ping-pong ball which makes whooshing noise which
			moves spatially to let you know where the
			ball is
		B) Tennis ball
		C) Mack truck
		D) UFO - sci fi
		E) Baby chick (peep peep peep...BGAAAWK...peep peep peep...)
		F) Other objects

	3) Difficulty (speed) of game

		The speed of the game will normally be slower than
			a normal pong game, since it will take longer to
			figure out where the ball is and how it's moving.

	4) Headphone loudness

	5) Other factors (gravity, etc.)

	Once the game choices are made, the game play begins.  The voice will
tell one player to serve.  The game processor must keep track of whether
the paddle hit the ball, and if so, how hard and in what direction.  The
processor won't know how the paddle was angled, so it will assume it was
orthogonal (or whatever) to the ball.  This allows a spin to be put on the
ball, if we want to carry this that far, by hitting the ball while moving
the paddle in a slight sideways direction.  The processor bounces the ball
off the court in 3-d and into the other player's court.  There could be a
small speaker mounted on each paddle, which could make the sound of hitting
the ping-pong ball, to give the players tactile feedback and to entertain
bystanders.  There could also be a speaker on the table, for the bystanders.

	There will be separate sounds for each player when the ball bounces off
a paddle, or bounces off the court, or dribbles to a stop, etc.  There will be
as many subtle audio cues as possible.  The sound of the ball's collision with
the paddle or the court will vary in loudness and brightness depending on the
speed and possibly the angle of the collision.  The pitch of the ball's motion
could have a slight doppler shift depending on velocity.  The critical factor
for game play will be how accurately we can inform the player of the ball's
distance and spatial position while it is in flight.  The main distance cue
is the proportion of direct vs. reverberant sound.  The main left-right cue
will be small time-delays between the left and right channels.  The up-down
cue is the most difficult, as it depends upon differences in frequency response
due to the filtering caused by the shape of the external ear.  Some research
would need to be done to find out how easily this latter effect can be
simulated.

	The audio motion object simulator might consist of the following:

	1) One or more Yamaha sound chips

	2) Delay controller, which would preferably be 1 or more
		microprocessors (6502), if speed constraints allow.
		The controller would keep track of where the RAM delay
		pointers are, read in and scale data from
		various locations, add it together, and save it to
		another location, depending on left-right time delay,
		percentage of direct and reverberant sound, and
		percentage of filtered sound.
		
	3) A RAM (on the order of 10K words.)

	4) A DAC, analog multiplexer, (processor-controlled) lowpass
		filters, and A-D's for doing the frequency-response up-down
		cuing.  This would ideally be done in software if we had
		something fast enough to do it.  Alternatively, we could
		skip the up-down cuing simulation and just raise and
		lower the frequency of the ball to indicate where it is
		vertically.  But the realism would be lost.  Another
		possibility is changing Yamaha parameters in real time to
		correspond to the change in frequency response between
		up and down.  This is the section for which much research
		must be done.

	5) Quality low-pass filters for the output.


	This circuit will be somewhat expensive, but there is no overhead
for a monitor and video hardware.  Even if some of the audio parameters
are somewhat arbitrary, so long as enough information is present, the
skill may be learnable and perfectible.  The speech synthesis could carry
on a running play-by-play, or could say to each player what the other
player is supposedly saying.  Once the basic game play and motion object
circuitry are designed, many variations can be easily added.

	A similar hardware could be used for a Star Wars type light saber
game.  The player puts on his blast helmet and uses the light saber, with
bat ranging circuit, to battle the floating training orb.

Subj:	SYSTEM I GAMES:  IDENTIFICATION BYTE


All system I games are required to initialize a byte in the configuration
area (Addr. 1006E specifically) to a certain value.  The utility system
on the main board interrogates this byte to determine if a new game cart
has been installed and clears the EEROM accordingly.  For more information
see the documentation file on the VAX at KIM::DRA0:[SYSTEM1.DOC]SYSTEM1.DOC.

The following values for the byte at 1006E have been assigned.  All new
System I games should contact Lori Carrabello (X2845) for assignment of
a number.

              Diagnostic Cart:  255
              Pack Rat:         00
              Marble Madness:   01

Subj:	calculations


Just some quickie ideas that might speed up the calcs

1) The ground objects (sets of points all with same orientation, with lines
drawn from a common set of points) were much faster than normal object
calcs. 

2) all normal objects are symmetrical around at least one plane. Thus 
nine mults for the first point, then THREE more for the second. This
may speed up normal objects by a third. More planes of symmetry mean
more savings. E. G. for a simple plane body and wings, old is 
(9+9+9+9)=36 mults. 2-plane symmetry is (9+3+3+3)=18 mults ==>twice speed.

3) Historically, in Star Wars we ran out of room for the vectors at the same
time as blinking started and excessive calcs(assuming all ground objects).
Remember that our ground objects were excessively simple. 

You are right that the calcs are the slowest. Vector is slow(blinking) only
during alphanumerics and banners (large pre-stored pictures).

4) if vector was faster(and this includes converting points to relative 
vector) then each ship could be done not only in brite outline, but also
with internal trusses, brite trusses near player, dim trusses away from
player. This would give the whole outline, with obvious direction cues.

TO: GROUP ALPHA
FROM: DOWNEND
SUBJECT: EXPANDED ROLE FOR MARKET RESEARCH PRODUCT MANAGERS.

Mary, Linda and Don have been playing a larger role in bringing
our products to the Market. The attached description formalizes
the role of the Product Manager.  The Product Manager role overlaps
and complements the Project Leader role. The Product Manager carries
the project into the Marketplace and makes sure it is presented in the 
best possible way to maximize sales. To accomplish this of course 
requires an intimate feel for the strengths and weaknesses of the product;
Hence, the Product Managers need to interact with the project during
the development. Please be sure to include the Product Manager as 
part of the team when setting up meetings and developing the product.

Calfee used to say the a game sold itself, i.e., the collections 
determined success or failure of the game regardless of any 
Sales or Marketing effort.  That may have been true when intial
orders for a game ran close to 10,000, but in the current marketplace
we desparately need the the Marketing follow-through of a Product Manager
to even get a few thousand games out there - only then can a game begin
to sell itself.
		- Chris Downend

Mary Fujihara has developed the following description:

Subj:	[avl.avl]avlno99.txt


I just created this new text file for the AVL.  It's yours to search at
your own risk, that is, anything associated with the vendors and vendor
part numbers might not show up in a search.  That's because this list
shows the Atari part number and description once only, listing vendor
sources on the following lines.  So if you search for an Atari part number
you'll find it with only one vendor, though there could be multiple 
vendors.  If you search for a generic part number (ex: 23128) you'll
find the Atari part number and those vendors with the generic pn as
a part of their vendor part number.  If the generic part number you're
looking for isn't listed in the generic field of the part description
you'll find either nothing, or vendor part numbers only (no Atari pn)
(unless the vendor pn is listed on the same line as the Atari pn and
part description).  You could even come up with something that has
the string you were looking for, but isn't the part you had in mind.

So as long as you're aware of the risks and/or don't care about vendors
at all, this is a much faster way to search for parts, especially since
it finds more than one string in the same time span.  

I almost forget to explain the name of the file.  Since most of us
in engineering don't care about spare parts I left them out of this
list, thus it's called avlno99.txt (99-xxx are spare parts).  If you
do need to look at spare parts, search [avl.avl]avl99.txt.  

(oops, forget should be forgot but I don't want to type all this again.)
That's all unless I think of something else!  Chris

(ps. please pass this on to Carol too, I could copy avlno99.txt to ERNIE.)

IF you have a locking office or lab...

AND IF you have no key for the above mentioned work space...

AND IF you have been LOCKED-OUT by janitors doing their job correctly...

THEN, this message is for you:

I have discovered a secret phrase in code that will should keep your door
unlocked during the night.  It is:

		Por favor,
		NO CERRAR LA PUERTA.

I also have been good enough to print a number of these phrases on small
sheets of paper, suitable for mounting near a doornob.  IF you would like
one, THEN come and see me.

Re: Namco Power Supply
Dt: 5/1/85


To put things into perspective I have converted the costs into dollars.
I have used the conversion that 12,740 Y = $51.00 .

				1K			5K
		          -------------   	-----------------
Switch Bracket		  120 Y  $ 0.48		  120 Y    $ 0.48

Transformer		3,000 Y  $12.00		2,800 Y	   $11.20

Switcher		5,250 Y	 $21.00		5,280 Y    $21.00

Filter			  540 Y  $ 2.16		  470 Y	   $ 1.88

Audio PCB		3,210 Y  $12.84		3,100 Y	   $12.40

Metal Base		  620 Y  $ 2.48		  620 Y	   $ 2.48
			-------  ------ 	-------    -------
		       12,740 Y	 $50.96	       12,360 Y	   $49.44	


I do not believe there is any way we can match these prices with
a unit that we design, purchase the parts for, and build.

I must raise the following questions about the Namco supply:
	
	1. Will the switching power supply operate over a range of
	102-135 VAC or must it be redesigned?

	2. Will the switching power supply operate at an installation
	ambient of 55 degrees Celsius without derating? 

	3. Both the switching power supply and the audio amplifier
	board are single-sided. In the past we have avoided the use
	of single-sided boards because the the parts have a tendency 
	to fall off due to vibration during shipping. Would that be a
	problem with this supply?

	4. Normally the remote voltage sense lines are connected at the 
	game board. Here they are jumpered together at the supply. 	
	Was this done on purpose or is this an error?

	5. System I and System II were designed to use +15 VDC and -15 VDC
	for the audio. This supply contains a 7812 and a 7912 which 
	normally produce +12 VDC and -12 VDC. Are they used in a circuit
	that raises their outputs to +15 VDC and -15 VDC or do they actually
	produce +12 VDC and -12 VDC? (System I can probably use +12VDC and
	-12VDC but Doug does not think it would be satisfactory for System II.)

	6. Is the heat sink containing the audio amplifiers and the regulators
	large enough to operate satisfactorily at an installation ambient
	of 55 degrees Celsius?

	7. Does the transformer have an acceptable temperature rise? Ours
	are Class 105 transformers with a maximum heat rise of 55 degrees 
	Celsius. This allows them to operate at a game installation 
	temperature of 38 degrees with a 12 degree rise to the inside of
	the cabinet. 

	8. How much will it cost to change the transformer to operate at
	120 VAC?

	9. In order to operate at 220 VAC and 240 VAC, either the power
	supply must be redesigned or we will have to use an auto-transformer
	which I believe would cost $14. 

	9. How much would the Namco supply REALLY cost if we were to use it?
	

Now about our supply (Power Base and Regulator/Audio III):

	1. $80 sounds a little high. My guess is that it would cost $70 if
	we bought the parts intelligently instead of scrapping the parts
	and then buying them back at a premium. Or paying a premium because
	of inadequate lead time.

	2. If the Regulator/Audio III could use two cheap trimpots for $0.20
	each instead of the Dual Audio taper pot that we pay $2.00 for, we
	could save $1.60 . (The pot wasn't supposed to cost that much; somehow
	Purchasing has managed to do it.)  

	3. If I could produce a supply that operated at only 120 VAC I could 
	reduce the transformer cost by $4.00 and the harness cost by $2.00 .


Caveat:

	At Atari there is no way to find out how much things will REALLY cost
	ahead of time. There is not even a way to find out how much things 
	have REALLY cost in the past.

	I think you should buy the power supplies from Namco and be done 
	with it.

Subj:	Building Access Hours

Inter-Office Memo                                  Atari Games Corporation



To:	All Engineering Employees

From:	Dan Van Elderen & Lyle Rains

Subject:	Building Access Hours               	Date:  May 8, 1985
 

Due to the significant cost savings of reducing the building access hours to
1272 during evenings and weekends, we are considering limiting "standard"
access hours to Monday-Friday, 7:00 a.m. - 10:00 p.m.  We would propose
having no security guards on evenings and weekends.  The majority of lights
and non-critical air conditioning would also be switched off during these
times.  The projected cost savings of such a change are approximately $95K
on an annual basis.

During "non-standard" access hours, building access would only be via
Schlage card entrance through the front lobby door, if your Schlage card was
appropriately programmed.  We have the capability of programming individual
cards on both a general and specific instance basis to allow this "non-
standard" access.  Depending on the specific area an individual was planning
on working in during non-standard hours, he might be required to throw a
breaker switch to get lights in his specific work area.  All power
receptacles (wall outlets) will be left powered on at all times; also all
major computer systems would continue to be left powered on.

Please respond with any input you may care to make regarding these proposed
changes.  Also please respond with any general and/or specific requirements
you may have for non-standard hours of access.  Please send all responses to
either Carol or Lori by this Friday, as we are considering the
implementation of something similar to the above proposal on Friday, May 17.

If you like to drink sodas, but don't want the sugar or calories,
fortunately for you there's diet sodas.  In the past the trade-off
was that saccarin could cause cancer.  Today the trade-off is that
women who drink diet sodas may stop ovulating, for that has been
found to be one of the effects of Nutra-Sweet[TM].

Of course it's totally up to you whether you see this as a feature
or a bug....

Subj:	computer utilization


    For those of you guys who have noticed the many differences between
batch and interactive, there may be a solution in sight.  There are now
two words (on kim & charm only) AT and BATCH, which do the desired command
in batch, PUTTING THE LOG FILE in the current default directory, and setting
the current default directory for the batch job to be the same as the
interactive job's default was.
    
    AT is used in place of an @ sign, when you are gonna execute a command
file anyways.

    BATCH is used for symbols or DCL commands (you can also type another
@ sign).

    Both of them are implemented as command files.  Each takes its list of
parameters, and examines each parameter in turn.  Until it finds a parameter
that does NOT start with a slash, the com file collects switches; these
are assumed to be qualifiers for batch (like /NONOTIFY or /PRINT or /NOLOG).
As soon as it finds one that does NOT start with a slash, the rest of the line
is assumed to be the command to execute (an @ sign is prepended in the case of
AT).  The defaults for batch submission are /LOG='default'BATCH/NOPRINT/NOTIFY
(/NOPRINT implies, since the log file won't be printed, it won't automatically
get deleted either).

    As usual, if any of my bugs should be caught unkilled, I will disavow any
knowlege or retractions.

Subj:	MACHO-BRAIN MICRO-MOUSE


   I have a functioning proto of Namco's Mappy MicroMouse.  This product is
marketed by Namco in Japan as a hobbyist kit (ala Heathkit) for building
and programming your own MicroMouse Maze contestant.  The original MicroMouse
Maze contests originated in the U.S. several years ago. Though the level of
popularity and interest in it has faded recently in the U.S., the contest
concept has received enthusuastic support and an avid following in Japan by
both hobbyists and corporations.  Mr. Nakamura, as president of Namco, is
one of the major corporate supporters of this movement in Japan, and serves
on the Executive Committee that is trying to organize and sponsor both
national and international contests thru-out Japan and the world. I suspect
it is this pet project interest of Mr. Nakamura that led to Namco's develop-
ment and marketing of the Mappy MicroMouse.  Anyway.....
   We now have a mechanically functioning prototype with reasonable mechanical
capabilities but no smarts.  Other than a simple selftest program and a couple
simple motion algorithms (i.e. left-hand rule), the kit comes basically
"unprogrammed".  Soooo, if anybody out there has an interest in AI or just
plain thinks they're clever or just wants to goof around, you're welcome and
encouraged to borrow the rodent and see what you can make it do.  Some English
instructions, batteries, and any required Eproms included. And if you can
guarantee a successful maze completion in less than 30 seconds, we'll consider
sending you to Japan this summer to compete in the international contest
being held at the Tskuba Expo 85 Science Exhibit.  (The most recent contest
winner had a best time of 30.13 seconds. See article in IEEE "The Insitute"
June, 1985.)

For those of us that use the Data I/O, If you havent noticed, our system 19
(Thats the one that burns many different types of ROMS) had burned out 
its cooling fan. So now it gets about 4 or 5 if not 10 times hotter than
when the fan was running. Well I just installed one of our "White Box" fans
in it so it will be running cooler than no fan at all. However, this fan
is not quite as powerful as the fan that was originally in it, so PLEASE!
when your done using system 19 PLEASE! shut it off before you leave. We 
take for granted how nice that piece of equipement is. Have you ever tried
to burn an 82S129 on the system 29? You cant! If your in the DIO room and
it appears nobody is using sys19, the on-off switch is in the back on the lower
left side (But also make sure nobody's using it)

New Product		Jed Margolin 5/28/85


	This is a box with a microphone connected to it. You can plug headphones
into it or you can hook it up to your stereo.

	Mode 1: You hum into the microphone (or play a kazoo), the box determines
		the pitch and uses it to control a Yamaha chip set. The play has
		a wide choice of instrument voices.

	Mode 2: As in Mode 1, however, it is "recorded". The player can then play it
		back while recording additional tracks. The tracks can be different
		instruments.

	If it is cheap enough it can be marketed for kids as a toy. It can also be
marketed for people who play single note instruments (such as clarinet, flute, saxophone)
who have not be able to use synthesizer technology if they did not also play a
keyboard.

Hardware:

	1. It will be powered by a transformer lump (To make it easier to do UL)

	2. The electronics will be:	
		6502
		RAM	(Perhaps Non-volatile)
		ROM
		Yamaha chip set
		Membrane switch pad, with illumiunated switch positions
		Cheap Pitch Extraction Circuitry (This is the key element)
					
	3. It should come with a cheap microphone and a kazoo so people can start using it 
	   right out of the box.

Subj:	Business Ethics


	I was thinking, while I drove to work this morning,
about starting a "special-interest group" on ethics. As if
to settle my internal debate, the radio announced that
Scientific Games Inc., recently named the supplier of tickets
to the California State Lottery, had started building a factory
in Gilroy months before the initiative passed. To those of you
still unfamiliar with the issue, SGI (a division of Bally) wrote
the initiative (i.e., their lawyer drafted a "model" which was
adopted by the "citizens group" which actually sponsored the
proposition), and contributed heavily to the campaign. There
was a time limit in the initiative which could only have been
met by contracting with SGI, but Gov. Dukmejian ignored it and
took a bit of heat for that, although the lottery directors of
most of the existing lotteries said publicly that it was an
unreasonably tight schedule. Anyway, the limit wasn't needed to
secure the contract for SGI.

	Now, the question for debate is:
    Given that SGI did all this legally, filing the proper
    funding disclosures etc., was their action ethical. More
    broadly: Is a company ETHICALLY bound to respect more
    than the letter of campaign funding laws when pushing
    legislation which would be directly beneficial to it.

	I would like to hear from any of you who are interested
in such questions (perhaps not including this particular one).
I will create a distribution list so we can carry on with a
"forum" without clogging "JUNK".

	Side note to industry watchers- The "factory in Gilroy"
sounds like Bally found a use for the old Sente factory, no?

	Just got through talking to Rob Fulop (some of you
old-timers may remember him). He is currently working at
Buy-Video (not sure of the spelling), and pushing something
called soft-ads. One example: He wrote a program for the
IBM PC which is sort of a "travel advisor", to help people
plan vacations. The program is "sponsored" by American
Express, so it leans toward their services and those of
Hilton Hotels, Hertz, etc. (who pay Amex for the plug). The
disk is sent out with Amex cards and included free in
"specially marked boxes" of Verbatim Diskettes. Verbatim is
happy to distribute, because it is adding value to the
blank diskette. Amex is happy because its customers like

happy because the program is useful, not ONLY an ad. Rob is
happy because Amex paid him.

Perhaps some of you brain-stormers will get some

I talked to Bob Fry today and asked him when the guy was coming
in to fix the ventilation in the office area.

Fry said that the guy had already looked at it and concluded
that it was already putting out as much air as it was capable
of.

I told Fry that there used to be a lot more air than there was now
and why was it all of a sudden incapable of putting out at least
as much as it used to? 

Fry said that the guy had already looked at it and concluded
that it was already putting out as much air as it was capable
of.

I told Fry that there used to be a lot more air than there was now
and why was it all of a sudden incapable of putting out at least
as much as it used to? Had he checked the right area?

Fry said that the guy had already looked at it and concluded
that it was already putting out as much air as it was capable
of.

I asked him why he woudn't answer my question.

Fry said that the guy had already looked at it and concluded
that it was already putting out as much air as it was capable
of.

He then advised me to set up a meeting with you and me and him
because he wasn't going to talk to me anymore. He then said goodbye and 
hung up.

This is the same man who earlier this year feigned surprise that the 
ventilation system wasn't working saying, "Nobody ever told me," 
(making Rick out to be a liar) and said that I should talk to him directly 
if there was a problem.

Since then, Fry has been completely unresponsive to my requests. It has
always been:
	1. The thermostat just needs to be adjusted.
	2. The system needs a few days to settle.
	3. Why didn't you tell me sooner.
	4. The system can't be made to work any better.  

Sometimes there is air and sometimes there isn't. Sometimes the temperature
is ok and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it seems to be directly related
to the temperature outside and sometimes it doesn't. 

There are two major problems:
	1. The system needs to be properly adjusted.
	2. Bob Fry


I would like you to take care of this matter before you go on vaction
because Fry is obviously not going to do anything for me and I don't
think I can stand it for another two weeks.

1) thanks for the mention.

2) a "even more 'more complicated'" tic for faster rotations involve
adding 165 tics for 10.5507 degrees.

	that is, 14/165 is .895 
		 78/165 is 4.986
	    and 165/165 is 10.55

I get the impression that there are other even higher angles that have common
factors, but the 10.55 is the only other one I have written down. I think at
these faster angles problems should start showing up cuz of associative order
changes between the Primary set and the Working copy.

FOR EXCAAMPLE, IN IT'S FIRST FIVE WEEKS AT FASCINATION ARCADE IN N>CN>Y>C>. .Y.C., 
"COMMANDO" EARNED A TOTAL OF $3860.75...IT'S FIRST TWO WEEKS WERE QUITE IMPRESSIVE
IMPRESSIVE...EARNING OVER $1000.00 EACH WEEK.

HOWEVER, LOOKING AT "PAPERBOY" WE SEE THAT IT EARNED $4135.25 FOR IT'S FIRST
FIVE SWEEKS...THAT IS ABOUT 275.00 MORE THAN "COMMANDO".

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT "PAPERBOY " IS A MORE CONSISTENT LONG TERM EARNER...
UNFORTUNATELY, THE COST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PIECES MAKES "COMMANDO"
SEEM LIKE A BETTER BUY...WE MUST CONVINCE OUR OPERATORS THAT WHEN THEY BUY
TH"THE BOIYY", THEY ARE GETTING A SOLID MONEY EARNER FOR THE LONG STRETCH, A GOOD
LONG-TERM INVESTMENT.

REGARDING THE NEW GAME "MAYHEM" (THE BALL BLAZER RIP-OFF) COLLECTOIONS ARE NOT

IS PITFALL !!II--IT'S BEEN DOING REAL WELL AND CONSISTENT AT THAT.

	I looked into the problem, and I think I know what is causing it.
Unfortunately, there isn't much I can do about it.  I am reasonably certain
that DEC has been bit by their own bug.  The system service to sense terminal
characteristics is supposed to return stuff you can send to the set
characteristics service; it doesn't.  All the information is there, but
it takes a page of code to rearrange it properly.  I begin to suspect that
DEC isn't aware of this.

	The program seems to continue to function after the error, so
I suggest that you ignore it until they fix it.  I will let them know about it.

Those of you using 68010 Cpu may be interested in the following 
potential pitfall.

Problem description. : The program goes out to lunch when 
returning from interrupt. (RTE instruntion)

Whats happening : The 68010  gets confused as to whether it is 
executing autovectored interrupts or not.

Solution : DTACK should not be asserted while VPA is asserted.

For some unknown reason, this bug has not shown up on System I.
However, on Gauntlet, using almost the same circuitry, the 
problem showed up immediately. System IV has had some occurances 
of the same problem.

I GOT WIND OF SOMETHING RECENTLY THAT I THINK WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP OUT
ON...YOU KNOW SOPHIE AND OMAR, THE CAFETERIA PEOPLE?  WELL, THEY ARE IN A
BAD WAY CURRENTLY AND COULD USE SOME HELP.

HERE'S THE STORY:

THEY ARE FROM IRAN (YOU KNOW, THAT CRAZY PLACE WHERE TERRORISM IS A NATIONAL 
PASTIME).  ANYWAYS, THEY ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET THEIR MOTHER OUT OF THEIR
BEFORE THE  (I MEAN THERE) BEFORE THE AYATOLLAH ((?) DECLARES WAR ON MOTHERHOOD.

WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THEY CAME TO ATARI SEEKING A LOAN IN ORDER TO GET SOME
DOUGH TO GET THEIR MOM OVER HERE PRONTO.  THEY ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO GET 
BANK LOANS, SELL THEIR CAR, ETC. IN ORDER TO RAISE SOME CASH (I THINK THE 
TOTAL REQUIRED IS CLOSE TO $8,000.00)

WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS THAT WE START A DONATION POOL TO RUN THROUGHOUT NEXT 
WEEK, IN ORDER TO HELP THEM GENERATE SOME CASH.  WE CAN EACH CONTRIBUTE
WHATEVER WE CAN GIVE AND AT THE END OF THE WEEK WE WILL TURN OVER ALL THE
MONIES COLLECTED DIRECTLY TO THEM.  PLEASE SEE EITHER SANDY BROWN OR MYSELF
IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE.

BY THE WAY, I HAVE NOT TOLD OMAR OR SOPHIE WHAT WE ARE DOING SO YOU MAY
WANT TO KEEP A LID ON IT FOR NOW.  THEY MAY GET A LITTLE EMBARRAED BY THE
WHOLE THING...BUT THEY DO REALLY NEED OUR HELP.

ONE THOUGHT I HAVE IS TO SACRIFICE OUR DOUGHNUTS NEXT FRIDAY AND PUT THAT MONEY 
INTO THE FUND...ANY OTHER IDEAS LIKE THAT WOULD BE MOST WELCOME.

ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS TO WORK LARGER DONATIONS OUT AS A LOAN...THEY ORIGINALLY
ASKED SHANE ABOUT LOANING MONEY FROM ATARI...I'M SURE THEY WOULD PAY BACK ANY
MONEY'S GIVEN, ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS A LARGE AMOUNT.

ANYWAY, PLEASE SEND ME ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE REGARDING THIS IDEA, ASAP.
I WILL GET BACK TO YOU SOON ABOUT DETAILS FOR THE FUND RAISER THAT WILL
RUN NEXT WEEK.

THANK YOU IN ADVANCE

	For those of you out there using the Applied Micro Systems
68010 Dev Sys, the following applys to YOU.  If you have internal
memory problems, that is internal to the AMS, then there is a simple
way to determine which chip is bad, if you decide it is a chip.
There is a file in CHARM::[DND]AMSMEM.DOC which contains a picture of
the RAM board and a list of which parts are at which addresses.  This
list is for a 256K Dev Sys.  MOst of you out there have 128K systems
with two RAM boards, each with 64K, The board lay out is the same,
the address spacing is probably, although I have not checked it out,
$1000 instead of $4000.

Subj:	New greenhills c compiler.


There is a new version of greenhills 68000 c compiler (V1.7.17)
available on kim & charm.

To use it make the following definition:-

$ ncc:== $sys$sysdevice:[green.1v7v17]ccom.exe

This appears to produce better code than the old one (V1.7.1).
(It certainly fixes a number of bugs that have been found in the old one)

There are two optimise switches available in this version -o & -o2.
The first does some good things, the second will probably upset certain
things (like volatile variables etc). The documentation for the new version 
is in SYS$SYSDEVICE:[GREEN.1V7V17.DOC].

				*** WARNINGS ***

The only gotcha (that I know of) is that it will produce a call to ldivt
in the following case:-

/* generic case of assigning to a pointer to a short */
test()
{
short *a,b,c,d;
  *a= (b * c / d); /* this produces JSR ldivt */
}

The fix is :-

/* cast the whole of the right side of the expression to short */
test()
{
short *a,b,c,d;
  *a= (short)(b * c / d); /* this uses DIV */
}

I would be interested in getting feedback on changes in code size and speed
so I can tell greenhills.

	Any bugs let me know.

			*** SYSTEM II STUFF ***

   There is a new DEVT11.LDA file available now. I have changed the downloader
to accomidate mmu offsets not equal to 10000 octal. This should come in handy
when you use more than 16 pages or when you set up your roms to use smaller
page increments.  The old ROMS should work fine as long as you only use 10k
increments.

	- Default page select offset is 10000 octal (page 0 select=00000,
	  page 1 select=10000.) However, if you want to use another
	  offset between two consecutive pages you can... The bottom 4 bits
	  of the page select word (address bits 16 thru 19) show the offset
	  /1000. (ie: 1 = 1000, 2 = 2000,...). 
	
		ex:
	             Output address = 30004000  (hex)  (default offset)
		     Download address = 40000 octal
		     MMU page offset = 10000 octal 
		     Page 3 (30000 octal) is selected for mmu page 0
		     Page 4 (40000 octal) is selected for mmu page 1
			

		ex:
		     Output address = 50024000  (hex)  (non default offset)
		     Download address = 40000 octal
		     MMU page offset = 2000 octal
		     Page 20. (50000 octal) is selected for mmu page 0
		     Page 21. (52000 octal) is selected for mmu page 1

Re: Revised Vaction Policy
Dt: 7/12/85


Since the new vacation policy takes effect March 31, 1986 I assume that

the "old" vacation policy will be in effect until then. Is this correct?

Since I currently have almost 5 weeks of vacation accrued and my 

anniversary date is January 15 your memo indicates that if I don't take most 

of it (all but two weeks) before January 15, I will lose it. Is this correct?

Now, about the "old" policy. The last memo that I have on vacation 

policy is dated 3/12/84 and was issued by Richard Stearns who was at that time

the Human non-Resources Director. According to this memo, employees could not 

carry over more than two weeks of vacation time each CALENDER year, starting 

January 1, 1986. This is the first time I have heard about the anniversary 

date method. When was it changed to the employee's anniversary date?

    To all you (VAX) C programmers and XEROX stockholders:

    I have available a small number (no more than ten at a time)
of documentation sets for the (new) C on Kim and Charm.  This
amounts to a copy of the help text on Kim (that's where it started).
I got lost trying to find my way through all the functions, and
since you can't ask for help in the editor (except, of course, TECO),
I needed a desktop reference.  So, I dumped the help text and MUNGed
it into a cross-referenced document.  Since there isn't any other
stuff available for version 2, I thought there might be some interest.
Come by and claim one if you can use it.  You will find them (if there
are any left) in the Data I/O room, on the bookshelf by the door
(right behind the public-use water cooler).  Of course, if there
aren't any left, you won't find them.  You'll have to wait for the next
batch.  I will keep up the supply to meet the apparent demand.  Don't
bug me about them, or I won't.

Subj:	Greenhills C compiler version 1.7.18


Ok all you Guys 'n Girls, its another edition of :-

         "lets try the new Greenhills C compiler".

We have (yet) another version (1.7.18). This one produces exactly the same 
code as the last version (1.7.17). but fixes some bugs that we hadn't found 
yet. I have checked that the code is the same, and it is. Sooo...
please make the following change to your login.com (or wherever you do it).

$ ncc:==$sys$sysdevice:[green.1v7v18]ccom.exe ! new one

	Please could everyone start using this version as we should get rid 
of the old versions. The new one has been used for a couple of weeks and 
doesn't seem to have any fatal bugs.

 I would prefer to have people make the change themselves, rather than 
putting the compiler in UTL$EXE and just change it when a new version 
comes in, as that could upset an unsuspecting programmer.

 It is necessary to use the latest version so we can get feedback to 
Greenhills on improvements, bugs etc.

		Any problems, comments etc. mail to this address.
			Thanks.

A number of users have mentioned some of the goofy things that BLISS16
seems to do when you try to tell it to swap the bytes of a word or just
to get the high byte of a word. I did some investigation into the matter
and have concluded that, "yep, it does things goofy, so don't do that".
There is a simple solution (if you haven't already thought of it):

	SOURCE : WORD;		!the source word
	DEST : WORD;		!the dest word
	REGISTER TMP : UNSIGNED BYTE;	!get a fast temp byte
	TMP = .(SOURCE+1);	!get the high byte
	DEST = .TMP;		!put in the dest

BLISS-16 generates pretty tight code for this type of thing.

I talked to Jim Wallin and got the following information regarding
CUSTOM I.C. WAFER FABRICATION:

  - DATE: 		7/23/85
  - VENDOR: 		NCR
  - LEADTIME: 		3 WEEKS; TYPICALLY 6 WEEKS
  - MINIMUM ORDER: 	25 WAFERS ( this is considered a production order)
  - TYPICAL YIELD: 	22-23 WAFERS (at wafer level or die level?)
  - COST PER WAFER:	$400.00


------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Reference, Don Paauw says there are 1000 die on a wafer for both
SLAPSTIC AND SLAGS. 

The cost per die is:

		($400.00)/1000=$.40 per die, untested, uninspected


Our minimum order quantity is: 
		
		(25 wafers)*(1000 die)= 25000 die untested, uninspected


In the case of SLAPSTIC which has (8) versions on one wafer, we get

		(25000 die)/(8 versions)= 3125 die of each version, untested
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
These two devices are relatively small. Hence, yields have typically
been in the 70-80% range. SLAGS had lower yields (50%) initially due to
poor processing by the vendor. When I say that the yield is 70-80% I mean
that 70-80% of the packaged parts received by Atari passed ELECTRICAL test
and inspection. Typically, the vendor performs one to three optical inspections
to screen out mal-formed die, reject die attach, and reject wire bonding.  
At this time I do not think Atari is paying for the creation of test programs
to electrically test die at the wafer level (wafer probe..."Sentry Testing").

In summary, actual yield from fabricated die to functional part, will be 
less than 70-80% since die fallouts at the wafer fab and packaging vendors
are not included. I have no data on yields in those two areas at this time.

Subj:	Work Hours


Well guys this is kind of embarassing. It's 10:00 AM and there
isn't much of Alpha-Gang around right now, and I don't know
when to expect to see anybody. I think that shifted schedules are
O.K. but I strongly believe that everybody's work-day should overlap
a solid 4 hours or so. This allows for us to interact, share ideas,
answer questions in our various areas of expertise etc. As a rule
of Thumb, I think that a starting time between 6:30 AM and 9:30 AM
is ideal. A normal work day is 8 hours plus an hour for lunch. I
know most of us put in a lot more than 8 hours and  I certainly
don't want to discourage that through rigorous rules. 

Please send me a note specifying your typical work hours. Also,
if you expect to miss your typical work hours, please call and
let me know. My number is 747-2867; Karen's is 747-2765; otherwise
just leave a message at the lobby.
		Thanks, 
			Chris Downend

	I have just placed a new version of make on UTL$EXE:. Those of
you who have been using make with no problems should continue to do so.
Those of you on whom make has died mysteriously should now have better
(i.e. existant) error messages to guide you. Those of you who have not
been using make at all should seriously consider it - read the file
charm::sys$userdisk:[Albaugh.Make]make.man for info and then see me.
You can save a lot of hassle this way.

Subj:	New ASM68 (kim only, for now)


	I have very recently (a few minutes ago) finished a command
parser for ASM68.  The old method used to be done in DCL, and was very
messy and slow.  The new method is in assembly, is still messy, but
it SHOULD be faster.  Along the way, I found several bugs in Intermetric's
stuff that I had to work around, plus the usual quota of DEC bugs.
I think I caught them all, but you know me!

	As usual, if any of your programs should be caught, or killed,
I will disavow any knowlege of my actions.

	All seriousness aside, if the new way doesn't work, you can use
the old way by saying OLDASM68 instead of the (former and now new) ASM68
command.

Subj:	More changes for the sake of change


	Per Jim Morris' request, I have changed ASM68 yet again.
This time, I tried to trap errors and warnings from the compiler
and return them so that command files executing the ASM68 command
may successfully determine if the ASSEMBLER exited with an
error (or warning) status.  If they exit the program after complaining
about errors without passing along the fact that they are exiting
in an error (or warning) status, there isn't anything I can do.
But at least the command file will tell you different things now,
where it used to always say that everything was fine.

The much-heralded new "Atari Product Bonus Plan" is ready for
Distribution. This new plan replaces the plan in effect since
March 1982 (revised March 1983). The new plan will apply to
all product sold since January 1, 1985.

If you report directly or indirectly to Chris Downend, please
see me anytime AFTER 5:00 PM, August 21, 1985, to get your
very own copy of the 6-page plan.

There will be a meeting at 10:30 AM, August 22, 1985 in the
Lyle Rains Common Area where Dan Van and possibly Dennis Wood
will be available to answer any questions.

Subj:	"Features" of the new ASM68


	As many of you may have already noticed, the new 
Intermetrics assembler for the 68000 has a few differences. 
You probably already know that you must say "BSET" rather 
than "BSET.B" or "BSET.L" ( also "BCLR" and "BTST" ), but 
you may not have noticed the change in the treatment of ADDQ
and SUBQ. The assembler used to automatically convert, say, 
an "ADDA #4,SP" to an "ADDQ", or an "ADDQ #12,SP" to an 
"ADDA". It no longer does so. The latter case produces an
(obscure) error message and the former produces EXACTLY 
what you asked for, which happens to be two bytes longer 
than the old automatic substitute and may well push branches
out of range and other fun stuff.

	SO, it would well repay your efforts to check all 
your sources for compliance with the new rules to avoid some
subtle and nasty problems. I should also point out that as 
of now you need to be sure to include the appropriate 
release of the assembler, as well as the compiler, when 
producing the archive tape for a released project.

	Incidentally, they also changed the starting number 
for symbols, so you can't easily compare .ol's. See me if you
are baffled
			Mike

P.S.	I wrote this memo on the bus this morning (which may
explain the choppiness), and am quite happy with my new toy,
an Olivetti M10 portable computer. Techno-freaks (and people
who would like to do their word-processing in formerly unlikely
locales are invited to drop by and play with it.

Subj:	27128A


It is important for all to know that when programming 27128 EPROMS that
you take a good look at what the "real" part number is. There is a
significant differance between an 27128 and a 27128A. The differance is
basically that a 128 is programmed at 24v and a 128A is programmed at
12.5v. I think currently the only 128A's we have are AMD's. So if using
AMD parts, take a good look at the number to see if it is an "A" or
not. It is too easy to confuse. You can also tell by the fact that AMD
also marks the 128A packages with a "12.5v PGM" at the bottom of the 
package.

Subj:	Memory Hogs


Well memory hogs, AMD has it for you - the 27C1024 CMOS EPROM. That's
right, a megabit on a chip. It's organized as 65536 words by 16 bits.
It comes in a 40-pin package. Access time is speced at 170nS. And
it can be programmed in 49 seconds! It uses 1.5 um CMOS technology 
resulting in a die under 80,000 square mils. It should be in full 
production by third quarter 1985. No price info; but figure $200.00
or so through 1985 and 1986.

Plus, they think the memory cell size can be shrunk even more yielding
multi-million bit devices.

so promptly.  Here are the Guidelines (let me know if you think this is
reasonable or unreasonable):

	- Shifted schedules are O.K.
	- Must include 4 hours in the core of the day for interaction
	- Ideal starting time is between 6:30 and 9:30 AM.
	- Normal work day is 8-hours plus an hour for lunch
	- Call and leave a message with Downend/Graham/Receptionist
	  if you're going to be sick or Accidently detained.

Here are the responses so far:

	Rivera:		9 am to 6 pm
	Lipson:		9:30 to 6:30
	Ralston:	7:00 to 4:30-5:30
	Drobny:		8:30 to 5:30 or 9-6
	Downend:	9:00 to 6:00

Websters says kudos is: "fame and renown resulting from and act or 
			 achievement: prestige". 
The rest of you can have Kudos too - just send in your work hours!

Subj:	remote sense on power supplies


The question has arisen as to the necessity of sense lines on 
five volt switching power supplies.

Background:
Traditionally, we have designed our in-house power supplies with 
remote sense for the five volts output. We found this necessary 
because there was an appreciable difference between the voltage 
at the power supply and the voltage at the logic board, due to IR 
drop in the harness and in particular at the edge connector. As 
the board aged the voltage drop tended to get worse, due to dirt 
and wear on the edge connector.

In recent times we have learned to make shorter harnesses and use 
connectors more suitable for power connections at the logic 
board.

For example, on Gauntlet while drawing 5.5 - 6 amps, there is a 
difference of 90millivolts between the 5 volt power connections 
and the sense connections, measured at the power supply. This is 
not likely to change with age, as the connectors are better and 
tend to be self cleaning.

The question then is. At what load current do we need remote 
sense on purchased power supplies. We have a sample of a japanese 
switching supply rated at 10amps. It does not have remote sense.
It does have an accessable voltage adjustment pot. A similar 
model from the same company, rated at 20amps does have remote 
sense.

Do we require remote sense for:
     		all supplies
     		all supplies supplying more than 5 amps
     		all supplies supplying more than 10 amps
     		we don't need remote sense

Send your vote,comments,thoughts,suggestions,etc. to this address 
please.
     			Pat.

5 SEP 85

POKEY STATUS

WALLIN/BRODREICK TELL ME THAT ATARI GAMES BOUGHT A LARGE LOT OF POKEY
WAFERS FROM ATARI CORP. FOR $.50 A DIE. APPARENTLY THESE ARE STILL AT 
THE WAFER LEVEL. AS WE NEED THEM, THEY HAVE BEEN SENDING THEM OUT TO
BE PACKAGED.

	CURRENT INVENTORY OF DIE:	54,000+
	CURRENT PACKAGED PARTS:		     0
	DIE AT VENDOR:		             ?

PAAUW RECENTLY EXAMINED 1 WAFER AND NOTICED THAT ONLY 25% OF THE
DIE WERE GOOD - THE OTHER 75% HAD A "RED DOT" INDICATING A FAILED PART.

IF THIS YIELD HOLDS FOR ALL THE WAFERS THEN WE REALLY HAVE 54000/4=13500 DIE.

LOOKS LIKE WE NEED TO:
	1) VERIFY DIE YIELD
	2) CHECK WITH ATARI CORP ON AVAILABILITY OF MORE POKEY DICE.
	3) DESIGN IN A NEW SOUND CHIP IN ALL DESIGNS NOW ON PAPER, EG.
	   SYSTEM 3D AND BEYOND

Subj:	Revised POKEY inventory


5 SEP 85

POKEY STATUS - REVISED

Well, when we went to verify POKEY die yield, we found that Atari Games has
54,000+ GOOD die. Dan Van has recommended that no further action is required
at this time on POKEY or a replacement thereof.

Here is a edited tabulation of various suggestions just for the record:

Brad Fuller: Hope we don't use POKEY too much longer: most SFX are now done
	  	on YAMAHA. Would like to see either (2) YAMAHAs per game or
		(1) YAMAHA and AMY.
Vickers (via Fuller): We have ability to make a new POKEY...we share rights 
		to it with Atari Corp. is their recollection.

Rivera: We could do our own simple version of POKEY with just the shift 
		registers, control latches  and square wave output and 
		maybe get 8-12 channels (instead of 4) 1n a smaller (24-pin?) 
		package. then the investment in RPM would still be useful.

At any rate, I agree with Dan - no need to worry at this time with 54,000
good die in inventory.  We will need to re-visit this in 9 months
or so (6/86) when POKEY supplies will have been depleted by the GAUNTLET
Production run!!

Subj:	Shareable libraries...


Those of you that have linked programs to the shareable libraries will
have to re-link them. This happens with each new release of VMS and is
an inconvience. For programs that are used by everybody (such as AS68K),
it is worthwhile to link them shareable. For programs that are only run
once in a while and/or by only one person, it isn't necessary to link
them shareable and you can avoid having to re-link each time a new VMS
or compiler is installed by NOT linking them shareable. In case you're
confused, then the following in an options file are:

	VAXCRTL.EXE/SHARE	!means to link to shareable library
	VAXCRTL			!means to link to non-shareable library

using C as an example.

Subj:	DIO volunteers anyone?


I need some assistance. We have max'd out the capabilities of our DIO's.
They currently each hold 64k bytes of memory and because of hardware
limitations (who will ever need more than 64k?) cannot be upgraded to
contain more. Since we are starting to use 27512's (64k bytes in one
EPROM), this is cramping everyone's style. DIO tells me that we can
buy (for a few thousand bucks) the latest and greatest model 29B which
doesn't have the 64k limitation. We can also get their gang programmer
which has 128k (not limited to, however) and 20 (count 'em, T-W-E-N-T-Y)
sockets that each can be programmed with different data. The gang programmer
is a model 121 and I've been lead to believe that production has (or had)
several and one of them might be "extra".

Here's where the volunteer stuff comes in. I need somebody to run this
down, see what can be done and how much it'll cost, etc. The one(s) who
use the DIO the most stand the most to gain by 'fixing' what we've got
and/or making recommendations for what we should get in the future. Atari
corp's production and engineering used IMI programmers which were better
than the DIO's, so maybe you can hunt one of those down. Anybody got nuthin
to do who wants to design and build a new one?

Subj:	SYSTEM I CART 2  & COCKTAIL


THE SPLIT SCREEN INTERRUPT ADDED TO THE LATEST CART BOARD CAUSES PROBLEMS
IN ITS CURRENT CONFIGURATION.  THE LEVEL 3 INTERRUPT CAN BE LOCKED ON IN
TWO WAYS. FIRST, THE LATCH CAN POWER UP WITH AN INTERRUPT REQUEST OR,
SECONDLY, IT CAN BE LEFT SET BY THE RAM TEST.  THE INTERRUPT IS NORMALLY
CLEARED BY THE FETCH OF THE SECOND LINE OF PICTURE CODE "FFFF". IN THE
OLDER GAMES THIS OBVIOUSLY WILL NEVER OCCUR AND THE GAMES WOULD BE LOCKED
UP.
  THE PROPOSED FIX IS AS FOLLOWS:
  SINCE POWER ON RESET IS NOT SENT TO THE CART, I AM PLANNING ON USING
"SOUND RESET" TO INHIBIT THE LEVEL 3 INTERRUPT. THE INTERRUPT WILL BE
ENABLED BY READING THE PORT AT ADDRESS 240,000. THIS SHOULD MAKE THE
CIRCUIT COMPATIBLE WITH PROGRAMS THAT IGNORE IT (ASSUMING THAT A "SOUND
RESET" IS ISSUED BEFORE LEVEL 3 INTERRUPTS ARE ENABLED
).  PROGRAMS THAT USE THE INTERRUPT WILL HAVE TO ENABLE IT BY READING
ADDRESS 240,00 BEFORE IT IS EXPECTED TO BE USED AND WILL HAVE TO RE-ENABLE
IT AFTER EVERY SUBSEQUENT "SOUND RESET".

 IF THERE ARE ANY COMMENTS OR OBJECTIONS TO THIS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP.

Subj:	AMOA Update


The AMOA show is scheduled for 10/31-11/2/85 in Chicago this year. This
of course is THE trade show for the Game and Coin-operated Industry.

The name of the game this year is Cost Reduction. Hence, a new booth has
been designed; you can see a Blueprint on the wall near Dan Van's office.
This booth is 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the previous booth and has room
for up to 12 games, an information booth, a conference room and a storage room.

At this stage the game line-up is: (4) Gauntlets, (3) Temple of Dooms and
either (2) Roadrunners or (2) Paperboys - depends on what shape Roadrunner
is in by show time. There will be (2) overhead displays set up on Gauntlet
and a third overhead display showing a video tape. All the games will come
from production - Engineering will supply the 3 overhead displays and 
associated paraphernalia, and (2) roadrunner kits. (for a real surprise,
read Websters definition of paraphernalia below...).

Attendence will be extremely limited - around 25 people total with around
half of that being Engineering Personnel. When you consider that the main
purpose of a show is to sell games, I think having as much as half the 
attendees from Engineering is pretty good.  At this point the Attendence list
includes Opperman, Rains, Van Elderen, Moore, and Downend. Then each 
electrical team (Alpha and Omega) will be allowed to bring 4 team members
each. With Gauntlet and Temple of Doom definitely at the show, four members
from those projects have been invited: Bob Flanagan, Pat McCarthy,

The DIO works again. I put in the auto-F/P select code so for EPROM's of
27128A and above, you don't have to be specific about either the device
number or the manufacturer. I.E. to program a 27256 you can specify a

	DIO>DEVICE any_garbage_you_care_to_type_in

because the DIO (somehow) can find out the EPROM type and manufacturer
right from the EPROM (in socket 1) itself. My DIO programs will fall
back to using the "any_garbage_..." if the DIO can't figure out what
part is installed.

HC series IC's may be a magic cure for some of our noise problems
associated with development system hookups.  The noise immunity of
these IC's is far better than Schmitt Triggers with the same delay.
There is another series called HCT that should not be confused with
HC because HCT input levels are the same as TTL and so offer little
noise immunity.

We have the new PO Box for Milpitas so it would be a good
idea to start changing the address on all those magazines
you want to keep getting when we move.

P.O. Box 361110
Milpitas, CA  95035

Changing the address now will save us money on forwarding them
after we move.

Subj:	DIO and MIXIT updates


MIXIT has been updated. The /WORD=n and /GROUP=m options now work (on
input files only, those options on output filenames are ignored for now).

DIO accepts n bit words (multiples of 8) and will try to program whole
words into n/8 EPROMS. If word size times EPROM size is greater than the
available memory in the DIO, it will automatically switch to programming
1 EPROM and will prompt for group number.

A word about group numbers. From the VAX's and DIO's point of view, all
words are organised the same, that is, bytes are stored in the file in
increasing significance and bits within the each byte are mapped directly
to the corresponding bit in the EPROM. In other words, higher addressed
bytes are assumed higher significance in the word. The Gangpak will
program n-byte words into n EPROMS simultaneously. Assuming 16 bit words,
the Gangpak will program:

  fileoffset +0  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5  +6 ...
	     -----------------------------------
  socket #    1   2   1   2   1   2   1 ...

If the word size were 24, then the Gangpak would program:

  fileoffset +0  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5  +6 ...
	     -----------------------------------
  socket #    1   2   3   1   2   3   1 ...

MIXIT and DIO (in group mode) behave exactly the same. MIXIT will extract
every nth byte from the input file starting with the group_number divided
by 8. Presently the group_number is the power of 2 significance of the
bit in the word and must be a multiple of 8. I.e. (in VAX/T11/6502 addressing)

	Group	bits	fileoffset (=byte number)
	0	0-7	+0
	8	8-15	+1
	16	16-23	+2
	24	24-31	+3
	etc.

If the majority would prefer that the group number be a byte number (0-3
in the above example), I would be willing to change it.

The important thing to remember is that the 68000 operates contrary to this
scheme. Bytes are addressed by DECREASING significance so the concept of
low byte/high byte should not be used. Instead use the fileoffset value
as an indicator of the EPROM contents (meaning I should really change the
group code to be a byte number).

Subj:	Bad Bug in Vax C (and in some PPS utilities)

	Just a polite warning to anyone using any C programs: (i.e. I
just got chomped upon by this bug):

	When using formatted input via VAX C, if you request a hex
(i.e. %x) conversion, any solitary zero will be dropped from the input
string. For example, if you type '0,4000' as an input address range, the
'0' will be ignored, and the program will only see a single input
item of '4000'.

	So far, at least two pps utilities (pbfmm and sys1gr) have this
bug. 

	A quick fix is to never allow zeros to be alone -- type 2 or more
in a row and the C input routine will notice the number correctly.
I.E. type the previous address range as '00,4000' and it should be read ok.

Subj:	FEAR AND LOATHING ON THE COIN OP TRAIL


FEAR AND LOATHING ON THE COIN-OP TRAIL

FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS I HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING ACROSS THE LAND, TALKING WITH
DISTRIBUTORS AND OPERATORS, AND LEARNING HOW TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS.  THIS MEMO
WILL TRY TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE LEARNED DURING THESE TRAVELS.

I. GENERAL INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
   
   IT DOES SEEM THAT THE INDUSTRY IS COMING BACK SOMEWHAT.  MOST DISTRIBUTORS
   HAVE BEEN STATING THAT THEIR BUSINESS SEEMS TO BE PICKING UP SOMEWHAT AND
   THAT THE OPERATORS ARE STARTING TO BECOME MORE HUNGRY FOR PRODUCT THAN THEY
   HAVE BEEN IN SOME TIME.

   OPERATORS, TOO, HAVE BEEN SEEING MORE POSITIVE SIGNS.  ON AVERAGE, I WOULD
   SAY THAT OPERATORS EARNINGS HAVE BEEN UP AROUND 5% OVER THE SAME PERIOD
   LAST YEAR.  WHILE THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE REAL HIGH OF AN INCREASE, IT'S
   A LOT BETTER THAN THE 20% DECLINES WE'VE SEEN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
   
   THE GENERAL FEELING AMONG OPERATORS AS TO THE COMEBACK OF THE INDUSTRY STEMS
   FROM A COUPLE DIFFERENT REASONINGS.  FOR ONE, THE OPERATOR IS BEGINNING TO
   FEEL THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN COMING OUT WITH BETTER PRODUCT LATELY...
   AND THIS PRODUCT IS STIMULATING INCREASED REVENUE.  AS WELL, I THINK THE 
   OPERATOR IS FEELING BETTER ABOUT THE MANUFACTURERS ABILITY TO PRODUCE GOOD
   PRODUCT AND REASONABLE PRICES.  ESPECIALLY WELL LIKED ARE THE SEVERAL 
   SYSTEMS AVAILABLE (NINTENDO'S AND OURS) AS WELL AS THE WIDE VARIETY OF LOW-
   PRICED KIT PRODUCT.  

   GOING INTO THE AMOA, ONE THING IS CERTAIN...THE OPERATORS WHO ARE LEFT IN 
   BUSINESS SEEM TO BE THE OLDER, ESTABLISHED GUYS WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND THE
   BLOCK A FEW TIMES.  THEY SEEM PRETTY BUSINESS SMART AND WON'T JUST BUY 
   ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT.  THEY CONSIDER ROI ISSUES CAREFULLY AND MAKE
   DECISIONS BASED ON THE EFFECTS TO THEIR WHOLE ROUTE.  THEY SEEM TO BE 
   EXTREMELY PRICE SENSITIVE AND WILL USUALLY OPT FOR LOW PRICED WHOLE GAMES
   AND KITS TO COVER THEIR ENTIRE ROUTES RATHER THAN INVEST HUGE SUMS OF 
   MONEY FOR A LOT OF HIGHER PRICED EQUIPMENT, EVEN THOUGH THAT EQUIPMENT
   MAY BE EARNING MORE THAN THE LOWER PRICED STUFF.

 
 II. WHAT'S HOT OUT THERE

   ONE OF THE HOTTEST THINGS GOING IN THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW IS CLASSIFIED
   AS "REDEMPTION EQUIPMENT".  THESE ARE THOSE CRANE GAMES, ETC. THAT YOU
   PUT COINS INTO, MOVE A CRANE ARM AROUND, AND TRY TO PICK UP PRIZES LIKE
   LITTLE STUFFED ANIMALS, RUBBER SPIDERS, PLAYING CARDS, ETC.  THESE 
   THINGS ARE EARNING A TON OF MONEY ALL OVER THE COUNTRY (WHERE THEY'RE
   LEGAL) AND HAVE A LOT OF DISTRIBUTORS AND LARGER OPERATORS EXCITED.
   THEY ARE TYPICALLY QUITE EXPENSIVE (6-7,000 BUCKS) AND ALSO REQUIRE A
   WEEKLY INVESTMENT IN PRIZES BY THE OPERATOR.    

   ANOTHER HOT CATEGORY, PARTICULARLY IN THE MID-WEST AND EAST COAST ARE
   "ACTION ORIENTED" PIECES SUCH AS SKEE-BALL AND ELECTRONIC DARTS...
   PARTICULARLY ELECTRONIC DARTS.  IN THE MID-WEST SOME DISTRIBUTORS SHOW
   ROOMS LOOKED LIKE DART SUPPLY SHOPS WITH ALL SORTS OF DART ACCESSORIES FOR
   SALE. AS WELL, MANY DART LEAGUES HAVE FORMED IN THE BARS AND STREET 
   LOCATIONS AND SEEM TO HAVE GREATLY SPURRED ON THE INTEREST OF ELECTRONIC,
   PUB-TIME DART ACTIVITY.  INTERESTINGLY, DART ACTIVITY OUT ON THE WEST
   COAST IS NEXT TO NIL, WITH MOST THINKING THE CLIMATE HAS MUCH TO DO WITH
   IT'S LACK OF SUCCESS...BUT, WOW, IT'S BIG BACK EAST!!

   OPERATORS ALSO SEEM QUITE APPRECIATIVE OF THE SEVERAL CONVERSION SYSTEMS
   THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED.  THEY DO SEEM TO FEEL THAT SYSTEMS ARE GOOD FOR
   THEIR BUSINESS AND THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE REALLY ATTEMPTED TO HELP THEM
   WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS. ONE THING, HOLDING THEM BACK, HOWEVER, IS
   A VERY REAL APPREHENSION THAT SOME MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT AS DEDICATED TO 
   SYSTEMS AS THEY WOULD CLAIM TO BE. IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO PROVE TO 
   OPERATORS THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE FOR REAL, BUT THEY ARE COMING AROUND.  THE 
   RELEASE OF "DOOM" IS MEANING GREAT THINGS TO THE OPERATOR'S BELEIF THAT, HEY
   THE ATARI SYSTEM IS FOR REAL.  WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENFORCE TO THE OPERATORS
   THAT WE ARE DEDICATED TO THE SYSTEM APPROACH, IF WE INTEND ON INCREASING THE
   BASE OF UNITS.

   WHILE SPEAKING OF WHAT IS HOT AND ON THE SUBJECT OF SYSTEMS, I WOULD BE 
   REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION...NINTENDO.  TO BE SURE, THESE GUYS ARE VERY
   HOT RIGHT NOW, AND OPERATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SEEM TO FEEL VERY STRONGLY
   THAT NINTENDO HAS DONE MORE FOR THEM THAN ANY MANUFACTURER IN THE PAST 
   SEVERAL YEARS HAS.  WHILE THEY WILL ADMIT THAT MOST OF THEIR GAMES ARE NOT
   THAT GREAT AS EARNERS, THEY ARE EAGER TO POINT OUT THEIR UNBELEIVABLEY LOW
   COST AND GREAT ROI BECAUSE OF THE LOW COST. THEY ALSO LOOK TO NINTENDO AS 
   FIRST OUT WITH A SYSTEM AND HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR SYSTEM OFFERING MANY,
   MANY GAMES AT THIS POINT IN TIME COMPARED TO THE COMPETITION.  ONE THING 
   NINTENDO DID THAT REALLY WENT OVER BIG WITH OPERATORS WAS OFFERING THEIR
   UNISYSTEM AS A CONVERSION FOR OTHER GAMES, NAMELY DONKEY KONG.  WHILE THEY
   INITIALLY STRUGGLED TO SELL BASE UNITS, IT SEEMS LIKE OFFERING THE SYSTEM
   FOR CONVERSION OF DONKEY KONG AT A REASONABLE PRICE REALLY DID THE TRICK.
   
   A FINAL WORD HERE, WOULD BE THAT IT DOES APPEAR THAT OLDER ORIENTED GAMES
   HAVE BEEN DOING QUITE WELL.  SEVERAL OPERATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS TOLD ME THAT
   THEIR NUMBER ONE PIECE THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THE QUIZ GAME TRIV WHIZ.  WHILE
   THIS GAME DOESN'T SHOW UP IN POLLS AND AT ARCADES, I THINK THAT OVER THE 
   BROAD SPECTRUM, OPERATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHOSE BREAD AND BUTTER 
   ARE DEFINATELY THE BARS AND GIN MILLS, NOT ARCADES, WOULD MAKE THE SAME
   CLAIM AS DID OUR DISTRIBUTOR DAVE GILFOR, OF ACTIVE AMUSEMENTS IN PHILLY...
   ..."I THANK GOD FOR TRIVIA GAMES THIS YEAR!"


III. COMPETITOR UPDATE
       
     HERE'S A BRIEF UPDATE AS TO NEW GAMES AND RUMORS I HEARD OUT ON THE ROAD,
     MOST OF THIS STUFF SHOULD SHOW UP AT AMOA.

     NINTENDO:
     NINTENDO HAS TWO NEW GAMES FOR THEIR UNISYSTEM. A SOCCER GAME THAT REALLY
     LOOKED LOUSY SHOULD NOT BE A FACTOR IN THE MARKETPLACE AT ALL, REGARDLESS
     OF COST.  ANOTHER GAME MACH RIDER LOOKED REALLY PRETTY BAD, BUT MAY DO OK
     FOR THEIR SYSTEM..IT IS RATHER POOR QUALITY POLE POSITION ON MOTORCYCLE 
     WITH SHOOTING AND OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE THROWN IN...STINKO!

     THERE IS ALSO RUMOR OF A ARM WRESTLING CONVERSION FOR THE BASE OF PUNCH
     OUT GAMES THAT ARE OUT THERE. APPARANTELY, HOWEVER, THE GAME IS NOT 
     TESTING THAT WELL, AND SINCE IS NOT DEVELOPED BY THEIR HOME DESIGNERS
     FOR THE UNISYSTEM, MIGHT BE QUITE EXPENSIVE, I.E. SUPER PUNCH OUT.

     THE OTHER THING THEY HAVE DONE IS COME OUT WITH A CONVERSION SET-UP FOR
     PAC-MAN THAT ALLOWS THOSE OLD PAC-MAN GAMES TO BE CONVERTED INTO, YOU
     GUESSED IT, UNISYSTEMS.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH 
     THIS CONCEPT AND OPERATORS ARE NOT EXACTLY GOING FOR IT AS THEY DID WITH
     THE DONKEY KONG UNISYSTEMS...THE PROBLEMS ARE FOURFOLD...THE PAC KIT IS
     EXPENSIVE (MORE THAN THE DONKEY VERSION AND ALMOST AS MUCH AS A NEW 
     UNISYSTEM)...IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSION...MANY OPERATORS ARE 
     RELUCTANT TO CONVERT PAC MAN'S...AND MANY OF THE PAC MAN'S HAVE BURNED
     IN MAZES IN THE MONITORS AND THE CONVERSION'S LOOK REALLY POOR BEHIND THE
     PHOSPHUR BURNS.

     BALLY/SENTE:
     NOTHING REALLY TO REPORT HERE, EXCEPT FOR A FOUR PLAYER HAT TRICK THAT IS
     PRESENTED IN A NEW FOUR PLAYER TABLE TOP CONFIGURATION, NOT FOR THE  
     EXISTING SENTE CABINET THAT ALREADY HAS BEEN CHANGED BEFORE.  THIS SEEMS
     TO HAVE REALLY TICKED OFF OPERATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO WERE HOPING THIS
     PIECE TO BE A CONVERSION FOR THEIR EXISTING SENTE SYSTEMS.

     BALLY HAS SHOWN NOTHING NEW EXCEPT FOR YET ANOTHER ARTICLE BY BOB MULLANE,
     THEIR CEO, IN BOTH CHICAGO PAPERS STATING THAT HE DID NOT OPTIMISTICALLY
     FEEL THAT BALLY WOULD BE A FORCE IN THE COIN-OP MARKETPLACE VERY MUCH 
     LONGER...IN FACT HE SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT BRINGING BACK 
     BALLY'S ENGINEERING FORCE TO ANYTHING LIKE IT ONCE WAS WOULD BE..."ALMOST
     IMPOSSIBLE."

     DATA EAST:
     THESE GUYS SEEM LIKE THEY WILL COOL-OFF SOON BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEEM TO 
     HAVE ANYTHING TO GOOD UP THEIR SLEAVES...(MAYBE THAT'S WHY TOM PETTIT AND
     JOLLY BACKER JUST LEFT?)...BUT YOU NEVER CAN BE SURE WITH DATA EAST...THEY
     ALWAYS SEEM TO PULL RABBITS OUT OF THEIR HATS.

     THEY HAVE TESTED A SHOOTING GAME CALLED "SHOOT-OUT" THAT IS SUPPOSEDLY NOT
     DOING THAT GREAT AND IS ALLREADY APPARENTLY SELLING AT ROCK BOTTOM CLOSE-
     OUT PRICES.  ALSO, WE KNOW THEY HAVE "TANK" WHICH WE HAD IN-HOUSE AND WERE
     NOT TO CRAZY ABOUT, RIGHT?

     WILLIAMS:
     THEY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN WITH ANOTHER SUPERB PIN-BALL GAME CALLED "COMET".
     THIS ONE IS REALLY, REALLY FUN TO PLAY AND OFFERS TONS OF ACTION UTILIZING
     AN AMUSEMENT PARK THEME.  IT OFFERS GREAT SOUND EFFECTS AND THE FIRST EVER
     1 MILLION POINT SHOT...WILL MAKE PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT SPACE SHUTTLE...ROGER
     SHARPE WILL LOVE IT (BUT IT DOES END ROGER!) AND HE'LL UNDOUBTEDLY CALL IT
     GAME OF THE SHOW AT THE UPCOMING AMOA.

     INCIDENTALLY, THE GAME IS ON TEST AT OUTER LIMITS MT. VIEW IF YOU WANT TO
     PLAY WITH IT.

     CINEMATRONICS:
     SURPRISINGLY, THESE GUYS ARE STILL AROUND...BUT PROBABLY JUST BARELY.
     THEY HAVE A SYSTEM OUT AND ARE SHOWING A PRETTY DECENT 2-PLAYER SOCCER
     GAME CALLED "POWER PLAY".  IT IS PLAYED LIKE SOCCER BUT YOU CAN PUNCH 
     OUT YOUR OPPONENT AND HIS GOALIE WITH A PUNCH BUTTON.  HEARING THAT IT
     IS NOT DOING THAT GREAT ON TEST.

     I HAVE ALSO HEARD ABOUT A BASEBALL GAME APPARENTLY CALLED "WORLD SERIES:
     THE SEASON".  DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT BUT THEIR SYSTEM DOES HAVE
     VERY GOOD GRAPHICS AND SOUND CAPABILITIES, JUDGING FROM THE SOCCER PIECE.
   
     KONAMI:
     THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWING A NEW CONVERSION FOR ANY RASTER GAME CALLED 
     "RUSH N' ATTACK"...IT IS A RAMBO GAME ALL THE WAY AND IS REALLY PRETTY
     GOOD.  YOU ARE TRYING TO RESCUE A BUNCH OF TIED UP GREEN BERETS AND ARE
     SNEAKING AROUND IN A RUSSIAN ARMY COMPLEX...IT'S COOL, YOU CAN KUNG-FU
     RUSSIANS, SHOOT RUSSIANS, GRENADE RUSSIANS AND EVEN FLAME THROW THE PANTS
     OFF OF THEM LITTLE COMMIE BASTARDS...REAGAN WILL LOVE IT...IT'S BEING
     CALLED "GREEN BERETS" IN EUROPE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SCARED OF THE RUSKIES
     OVER THERE.

     SEGA:
     APPARENTLY NOTHING NEW BESIDES HANG-ON, WHICH IS DOING PRETTY WELL BUT IS
     RATHER EXPENSIVE.  THESE GUYS ARE ALSO HEAVILY IN TO DOING THE AFORE
     MENTIONED "REDEMPTION EQUIPMENT"...AND OFFER SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF
     CRANE GAMES CURRENTLY.

     ATARI:
     I MUST MENTION THE UNBELEIVABLE REACTION WE HAVE BEEN GETTING FOR 
     "GAUNTLET".  WORD IS DEFINATELY OUT THAT THE PIECE IS HOT AND THE WHOLE
     INDUSTRY SEEMS TO BE VERY EXCITED BY IT'S EXPECTED RELEASE.  EVEN 
     OUR MANUFACTURING COMPETITORS ARE SAYING THEY REALLY THINK THE PIECE IS
     A GOOD ONE.

     "TEMPLE" TOO IS REALLY DOING WELL AND SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN THE MARKET AWAY
     FOR USED "MARBLE MADNESSES" ALMOST OVER NIGHT, AS OPERATORS SCRAMBLE TO 
     GET CHEAP BASE UNITS TO CONVERT.  WITH THE USED CABINET MARKET GONE, AND
     THE GAME DOING GREAT, WE SHOULD HAVE A REAL GOOD SHOT AT INCREASING THE
     BASE UNITS OF SYSTEM 1.
     
     THE BOY STILL HANGS! CHECK THE LATEST PLAY-METER POLL...

IV.  SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS

     WELL ALL THIS IS FINE AND DANDY, BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT CAN BE 
     DERIVED FROM ALL THIS THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO UTILIZE FOR PROFITABLE
     FUTURE PRODUCTS:

     1.REDEMPTION EQUIPMENT PSYCHOLOGY:
     KIDS ARE FEEDING QUARTER AFTER QUARTER INTO THESE THINGS JUST TO GET A 
     STUPID EL-CHEAPO PRIZE...SHOULD WE THINK MORE SERIOUSLY ABOUT TRYING
     TICKET DISPENSORS ON VIDEO GAMES TO AWARD PRIZES SOMEHOW TO PLAYERS?
     IT SURE SEEMS TO DO GREAT THINGS TO EARNINGS REPORTS!!!

     2.MORE ACTION ORIENTED OR ACTIVE GAMES
     MAYBE THERE IS A WAY TO SOMEHOW COMBINE THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OF, SAY, A
     DART OR SKEEBALL GAME IN COMBINATION WITH VIDEO...GOLF IS REALLY BECOMING
     A POPULAR SPORT OF THE MASSES, REMEMBER THE GOLF TRAINER?

     3.BAR GAMES:
     WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE, BUT WE REALLY SHOULD CONSIDER DEVELOPING
     SOME ADULT ORIENTED PIECES...SOME SORT OF TRIVIA OR QUIZ GAME COULD BE
     SUCCESSFUL FOR A SYSTEM CONVERSION.

     4. SYSTEMIZING OLDER EQUIPMENT:
     IT SURE WORKED FOR NINTENDO, AND IT WOULD PROBABLY WORK WELL FOR US.
     SOME OF THE OLD CENTIPEDES WOULD MAKE A GREAT BASE FOR SYSTEM 1 AND WE
     COULD POSSIBLY THEN OFFER A SYSTEM 1 CENTIPEDE/MILLIPEDE KIT FOR THOSE
     WHO WOULD WANT A SYSTEM BUT DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF THEIR CENTIPEDES.


THAT'S ALL FOLKS...UNTIL NEXT TIME,

Subj:	TPU section file update


'tis the last update for many moons. The latest features of EDTEM are:
(in addition to previously mentioned features)

	Gold/W - display aux window/make current window full screen
	Gold/up_arrow - goto aux window
	Gold/down_arrow - goto main window
	Gold/I - read a file into aux_buffer for INSPECTION (read_only)
		(NOT the same as INCLUDE file =AUX)
	Gold/U - read a file into aux_buffer for UPDATE (auto-write on exit
				or at next Gold/I or Gold/U)
	Gold/L - Learn the following key strokes (macro creation)
	Gold/R - Remember the previous keystrokes (macro end)
	Up_arrow/Down_arrow take into tabs into account (works like EDT).
	All EDTEM commands can be entered via Gold/KP7 (as well as TPU
	   commands. Gold/KP7 EXIT is VAXTPU exit however.)
	Bells are turned off at EXIT
	...working message on prompt line

You can adjust the size of windows by entering the VAXTPU command:

	aux_size := bla_bla;	!default is 8 (includes a status line)
	full_screen := whatever; !default is 22 = 
				!    24 - 1 message line - 1 prompt line
You'll need to do a couple of Gold/W's to make the new sizes take effect.
There are no checks for legit values for these sizes, so if you set them
to something goofy, you may get some pretty wierd displays.

I'll fix bugs (maybe), but no more gizmos, please.

I forgot to mention three additional items:

	Assign logical name TPU$EXT to the default file extension you
	   use or will be using frequently, such as .C or .B16. The
	   new EDTEM section file will apply this default to filenames
	   to be edited. (The system defualt is ".").

And left over from debug of the procedures:

	Gold/C does: compile(select_range);edt$reset;
	Gold/M toggles main_window between main_buffer and
		message_buffer if current_window is main_window.

Incidently, only the last 20 messages are saved in message_buffer, not
all since edit startup.

Subj:	to "C" hackers


WARNING: A lesson which might be less painful for you if you learn it here:

    FILE *outfil;
    char c;		/* output char */
    int err;		/* putc() result code */
	.
	.
	.
    if ((err = putc(c, outfil)) == EOF) {
	perror(" Output error in putc() - disk full? ");
	return (ERROR);
    }
	.
	.
	.

This will screw up on binary files when (c = 0xFF) is output, because putc()
will return the sign extended argument, which will be EOF (-1) rather than 0xFF.
You need to either check ferr(outfil) on EOF, or call putc(c & 0xFF, outfil) to
suppress the sign extension.  It ain't like getc()!!

OLD NEWS:  Also, since getc and putc() are #define macros on some systems
(including UNIX), don't make calls like putc(*cp++, outfil), since the side
effect will blow up in your face.  Use fgetc() and fputc(), which make proper
subroutine calls instead.

I found some old notes today:
	Dateline: October 1982
		  2732-300 EPROM's cost $4.50
		  2764-300 EPROM's cost $8.25
For Comparison:
	Dateline: October 1985
		  27128-300 EPROM's cost $1.90
		  27256-300 EPROM's cost $3.75

That says that the cost per bit is about ONE-TENTH of what is was 3 years ago!
	14 cents for a 1000 bits in 1982;
       1.4 cents for a 1000 bits in 1985;
       .14 cents for a 1000 bits in 1988???....271024 EPROMS for $1.43
Wow.

...about the TPU section file being stable. I made one last (?) small change.

It will look for a file pointed to by TPU$INIT: to do last minute setups.
The file is assumed to be a .TPU file, is loaded into tpuinit_buffer and
executed. If the execution succeeds without errors, then the tpuinit_buffer
is deleted else it is left hanging around so you can edit it to fix it.

Useful to do customising for particular jobs. You can use UTL$COM:EDTINIT.TPU
as an example or as your setup file if'n you want. Assign TPU$INIT: to
a directory and file (defaults to .TPU).

   In that fine Atari tradition, I wax philosophical, before I leave this 
place.  I have "tendered" my resignation.    
   I look around and I still see an incredible collection of funky creative
people. There is still some of "that old magic" that first impressed me when
I joined Atari. I hope the kinds of games that come out of your heads
continue to be far out.  I think Atari will consistently put out several
successful games a year, and I don't forsee any other place, not even Data
East, being able to do that. Keep on doing that Voodoo you do.
   I hope the games will be leaders and not followers.  For what it's worth,
I personally like the kind of game that transports the player to a world
previously unimagined, something a computer can do so well (eg, M.M.).  I 
think accelerator is one of those types, and I wish it the best.  I remember
what first attracted me to video games was that ability to create a 
concrete abstract world.  ( "concrete abstraction": I like that).  But 
then that was the days of dancing geometric vector games.
   God how I hated Pac Man.  I have this knack for liking unpopular games,
and hating popular ones. Fred Silverman has a golden gut. I have a tin one.
However, it's better to know what you like than to know what others like.
Besides, Silverman is fatter than I am. 
   I must say how much I enjoyed being part of The Last Starfighter team.
One thing I have learned at Atari is that I function much better as a team
member. I regret my situation on my current project, where I am the only
implementor. I dont seem to very good in that role. (Yes, I'm bitching now).
   I have been on the interview trail the last 4 weeks, and I have 
discovered that there are more suitable environments for me than this one.

Subj:	New Utility- QDF


    I have written a "Quick and Dirty Formatter" to translate
an Intermetrics .AB file to an extended Tekhex .HEX file.  It
will also include the symbol table in a form palatable to the
Applied Microsystems. To use it, first define a symbol like: 

    QDF :== $ UTL$EXE:QDF

in your login.com file (or wherever). Then format a file with:

    QDF filename

This is a simplified form of:

    QDF infile[.AB] [outfile[.HEX]] [/S=[symfile[.SYM]]] [/W[=width]]

which is what it will tell you if you say "QDF ?". A detailed
explanation of switches and options is in DOK:QDF.DOC, but
simply, the "infile", with default extension ".AB" is read and
converted to extended tekhex which is written to the "outfile",
with optional extension ".HEX". If the /S switch is present
with a filename (default extension ".SYM"), the symbols will
be output also. If only "/S" is present (no filename), the
symbols will be included in outfile.HEX. The /W switch sets
the width of the output lines. The default is 80 columns.
"/W" alone (no parameter) is equivalent to "/W=132". 

    The merged output should make downloading a little
easier, and the longer lines (even 80 is longer than usual)
should make it faster. QDF takes about 1/4 the time of CFOR,
plus 5% more if symbols are included. I make no representation
that this program is the general solution to all formatting
needs, nor that it will prevent tooth decay in rats. It is
intended as a quick substitute for CFOR and GENSYM.

Subj:	An undocumented feature of TPU (aka bug)

I didn't know it did this and it may cause you a problem later:

	At each edit startup, TPU automatically searches for, opens
	and reads in a file named TPUINI.TPU from the current
	default directory (SYS$DISK:[]). It does this after the
	the section file init and command file (if any) specified
	on a /COMMAND option has been read in. This means it is
	possible (if using UTL$EXE:DMSEDTSECINI) to have 3 startup
	command files:

	First - any specified by logical TPU$INIT:
	Second - any specified by /COMMAND at DCL level
	Third - a TPUINI.TPU file located in the current
		default directory.

The TPUINI.TPU file can be a real problem if you've created a bad one
(maybe an infinite loop in it or something), and try to use TPU to fix
it!

Well, I'm preparing my retirement as the only
secretary in Engineering.  As I'm sure you know,
Cyndy Grossman is returning on Monday as Dan and
Lyle's secretary.  It's been a hectic two months
but we all made it!  I just wanted to thank
everyone for the support I received when I needed
it.  You responded when I hollered HELP!  I'm sure
I wasn't able to give you the amount of support
you were used to but you understood the situation
and never grumbled (at least where I could hear
you!).  I think this really showed we've still got
that old Atari spirit.   Anyway, this did give me
a chance to get to know Electrical Engineering
alot better and put some names and faces together
for the first time.

Special thanks to Design Services, who I'm sure
felt orphaned at times.

Anyway, it's all behind us now and HAPPY DAYS ARE
HERE AGAIN, let's give a big cheer for CYNDY!!!!!!

(It's been real, but I'm glad the cavalry
finally arrived!)

	Per Messr Peter Lipson's request, I have added an
option to QDF which will allow you to omit the RAM portion
of your .HEX files. The switch is "/R" and is described in
the updated DOK:QDF.DOC. Briefly, to format a file without
RAM initialization use:
	$ QDF file/R=0-3FFFFF
(assuming System I memory map). This little feature exacts
a performance penalty of 4% whether you use it or not. That
is, formats now take 26% as much time as CFOR did instead
of 25%. If this is intolerable, duke it out with Lipson and
let the winner tell me what to do about it.

Subj:	Screen mode debugger


    Some of you might appreciate a brief intro to the version 4 VMS
debugger. DEBUG works with all VMS languages, so C, BASIC, FORTRAN and
MACRO32 programmers can use it (even with mixed language programs). It
is a powerful debugger, but quite wordy, which can sometimes be rather
annoying. One of the best things about the debugger is screen mode
monitoring. In order to make full use of the screen mode, you need to
compile your programs /LIS/DEBUG and link them /DEBUG. This will cause
symbols and references to the listing file to be loaded in the
executable. DEBUG reads commands from DBG$INPUT and writes its output to
DBG$OUTPUT which are, by default, assigned to SYS$INPUT and SYS$OUTPUT
respectively. If your program expects input from SYS$INPUT and writes
output to SYS$OUTPUT AND you re-assigned them to other than your
terminal, you'll need to 

    $ ASSIGN SYS$COMMAND DBG$INPUT
    $ ASSIGN SYS$COMMAND DBG$OUTPUT

sometime before you start your debugging. The debugger will
automatically startup when you run your program if you've linked it
/DEBUG. The only module it will know about will be the first one
specified in the link command. For example, a LINK command $ LINK
ONE,TWO,THREE/DEBUG would create an image, ONE, with three modules in
it: ONE, TWO and THREE. The debugger would know that there are 3
modules, but wouldn't know about any symbols and such about any but ONE.
You need to type a SET MODULE xxx to the DBG> prompt to get additional
modules. For you C programmers, debug becomes case sensitive at startup
so you need to type module names in UPPERCASE or it'll give you a
rasberry. DEBUG will attempt to open and execute a startup file
pointed to by DBG$INIT (if any) so you can create a file putting in it
any/all SET MODULE command(s) or anything else and point to it with
DBG$INIT to speed things up a bit. (Note: most commands and options can
be abbreviated to 3 characters, some can be abbreviated to 1 char such
as EXAMINE, STEP, GO, etc.) You can break execution of your running
program at anytime by typing ^Y (unless your program has disabled ^Y's)
and typing DEBUG to DCL's $ prompt. 

Breakpoints:

    By setting breakpoints, you can suspend program execution at
specified locations. The breakpoint is taken before the instruction at
the specified address is executed. You set breakpoints with the SET
BREAK command: 

    DBG>SET BREAK [/qualifier] [address_expression -
    	[,address_expression...]] [WHEN (expression)] -
    	[DO (command_list)]
    DBG>CANCEL BREAK [/qualifier] [address_expression -
    	[,address_expression...]]

    The qualifiers allowed on the SET/CANCEL BREAK are:

    	/ALL		!valid on CANCEL BREAK only
    	/AFTER:n	!break only after n occurances
    	/BRANCH		!break on all branches (no address_exp allowed)
    	/CALL		!break on all CALL's (no address_exp allowed)
    	/EXCEPTION	!break on all exceptions
    	/INSTRUCTION	!break on all instructions (single step macro)
    	/INSTRUCT=(op_code,...) !break on selected instructions
    	/LINE		!break on each line (single step hll)
    	/MODIFY		!break on any memory write
    	/RETURN		!break on all RET instructions (subroutine return)
    	/[NO]SILENT	!displays no message when watchpoint hit
    	/[NO]SOURCE	!displays the source line that caused the hit
    	/TEMPORARY	!watchpoint is cancelled after first activated

    A breakpoint is a program location where the debugger performs the 
following actions: 1) Suspends program execution; 2) Checks the /AFTER 
count and resumes execution if the specified number of activations 
has not been reached; 3) Evaluates the WHEN clause (if any) and resumes 
execution if it evaluates FALSE in the current language; 4) Displays 
the name or address of the location where program execution has been 
suspended; 5) Executes the commands in the DO clause if one was 
specified; 6) Issues the DBG> prompt (if a DO command was not GO).

Tracepoints:

    A TRACEPOINT is identical to a BREAKPOINT except that program 
execution always continues after the trace is reported. The syntax and 
options on the SET TRACEPOINT are the same as for the SET BREAK:

    DBG>SET TRACE [/qualifier] [address_expression -
        [,address_expression...]] [WHEN (expression)] -
    	[DO (command_list)]
    DBG>CANCEL TRACE [/qualifier] [address_expression -
    	[,address_expression...]]

See the details on the SET BREAK command.

Watchpoints:

    By setting a watchpoint, you can cause the program to stop whenever 
a particular variable or other memory area has been modified. When a 
watchpoint in your program is activated, the debugger suspends 
execution and reports the location of the variable modified, the 
initial and changed values of the variable and the instruction that 
caused the modification:

    DBG>SET WATCHPOINT [/qualifier] address_expression -
        [,address_expression...] [WHEN (expression)] -
    	[DO (command_list)]
    DBG>CANCEL WATCHPOINT [/qualifier] [address_expression -
    	[,address_expression...]]

    The qualifiers allowed on WATCHPOINTS are
   
    	/AFTER:n	!begin trace/watch after n occurances
    	/[NO]SILENT	!displays no message when watchpoint hit
    	/[NO]SOURCE	!displays the source line that caused the hit
    	/TEMPORARY	!watchpoint is cancelled after first activated

WATCHPOINTS sound neater than they actually are. They only report on 
accesses that MODIFY locations, you cannot watch a location for READ 
access. The debugger causes the hardware to detect these modifications 
by setting the write protection on the location in question. A serious 
problem occurs due to the fact that the VAX's memory protection is 
effective to a granularity of 512 bytes (1 page). The modification is 
reported to DEBUG by the hardware via an ACCESS VIOLATION FAULT. Debug 
examines the addresses involved in the fault and decides whether it 
really is a fault or not. If the variable in question is surrounded by 
rapidly changing data, there will be many many faults making your 
program run V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W. There are further complications if you
happen to have a disk buffer (or any buffer used by a VMS function) in
the vacinity of a watchpoint variable. What happens in this instance is
that VMS is given the ACCESS VIOLATION FAULT and it gives up with
INVALID USER BUFFER which can really be misleading (Gee...what does
"invalid user buffer" mean? and besides, it worked a couple of minutes
ago...). 

Screen Mode Debugging:

    Type PF3 on a CIT-101 or VT100 to put the debugger in screen mode.
You'll notice that it creates 3 windows. The top window displays the
source (from the LIST file) including LINE numbers and is labled on
the very top line with: 

    ---SRC: module file_name --source-scroll-----

The SRC labels the window, the "module file_name" indicates the file 
from where the currently displayed source came, the "source" flags the 
contents of the window as being source data and "scroll" means that the 
scroll keys will operate on this window (typing a keypad 3 will move 
the scroll word to the OUT window).

The middle window is for debugger output and is labled with: 

    ---OUT---output-------------------------------

The bottom window is for command input. The pointer on the left side of
the top window points to the next instruction that will be executed. The
keypad has some predefined keys to do some useful things. Some of the 
most often used keys are listed here:

    (Gold = PF1, Blue = PF4, HELP = PF2, HELP = Gold/PF2, HELP = Blue/PF2)

    PF3 = Set mode screen	!to setup in screen mode
    Gold/PF3 = Set mode noscreen !to turn off screen mode
    8 = scroll window up	!up_arrow function
    2 = scroll window down	!down_arrow function
    3 = toggle scrolling from SRC to OUT !move scroll function to other window
    5 = examine/source .0\%PC	!display source at current PC
    - = make SRC window full screen
    Blue/- = put SRC and OUT windows up
    0 = step to next instruction 
    Gold/0 = step into subroutine !default is to step OVER subroutines
    Blue/0 = step over subroutine !if you changed the default to step/into
    , = GO

There are tons and tons of options avaliable. The DEBUG manual is about the
size of a Wards catalog, but you are welcome to brouse through it and 
order up all that you take a liking to.    

Happy debugging

Subj:	Hummer

			Project Proposal - Hummer/Synkazoo


1. Brief Description

	This is a small hand-held musical instrument which analyzes the pitch
and amplitude of humming, singing, or whistling, and controls the corresponding
parameters of a built-in polyphonic synthesizer (Yamaha chip.)  The user would
be able to listen to a click track and overdub drum, bass, lead guitar, and
various other instruments, turning the vocalist into a 1-man band.  

	There would be output jacks for connecting the device to a home stereo
or a guitar amplifier, and there would possibly be a built-in speaker.  Also
there would be a MIDI music synthesizer serial output, so that musicians could
control their synthesizers with their voice.  The instrument would preferably
be powered by either batteries or an external transformer lump. 

	Other features could include the option of quantizing each note to the
nearest semi-tone, for people who aren't that great at singing or humming in
tune.  In this mode, vibrato could be selected, to substitute for the voice's
natural vibrato.  There could be an octave select switch, so you could play
much higher or lower than you can hum.  And there could be speed select as
well, so you could hum a fast part slowly and double the speed on playback. 

	The voice is the most expressive musical instrument, and with this
product, it can be used to directly control a variety of synthesized
instruments. 

2. Market

	A. Musical toy users - these people would be attracted to the idea of a
hand-held 1-man band electronic kazoo.  These are the people who buy $200 Casio
keyboards with built-in tacky rhythm, Mattel Syn-Drums, etc.

	B. Vocalists - these people could turn themselves into any instrument
of the orchestra.
	
	C. Synthesizer owners - would view this as an inexpensive accessory
that would allow them to do new and vastly more expressive effects.

	D. Other musicians - composers could try out how different musical
lines work together, without having to write the music out and multi-track it.
Players of other orchestral instruments could use those instruments to 
control the synthesizer.

	It seems like there is potentially a huge market, both fad- and non-fad-
oriented, depending on the price.

3. Price - very rough estimates

	6502	$1.50
	RAM	 8.00
	ROM	 1.50
	Yamaha	 9.00	(this is a smaller chip, 3 FM voice + built in GI
				chip which could be used for drums and click-
				track, plus a monophonic DAC)
	A-D	 2.00
	Mic	 2.00
	Speaker	 1.50
	Display	 2.00
	Switches 2.00
	Electr.	 7.00	misc. electronics
	Package	10.00
		_____

	       $46.50
	    X	    4	consumer markup
		_____

	      $186.00	

	The general consensus that was reached with people I've talked to is
that the product probably needs to be under $200 to reach the broadest market.
Future models could include more voices, more memory, more features, for more
money.

4.	Potential Problems

	A. Technical
	
		The only real technical difficulty other than cost-reduction is
	the pitch-tracking.  There are many waveforms for which the pitch is
	undefined, and the 1.7 mHz 6502 has to figure out the pitch in real 
	time.  The issues are - how many pitch errors will be made, how 
	objectionable will they be, will there be a noticable delay between
	when you hum and when you hear the output, and can it be done in real
	time.  There is a product being sold for the Atari 800 which does
	many of these functions in real time, using only an external ADC, and
	using the 1 mHz 6502 to do the analysis.  Fortunately, singing or
	humming	is more strongly pitched than spoken voice, so the pitch
	analysis can be somewhat simpler.  My feeling is that the technical
	difficulties will not be limiting factors. 

	B. Legal

		Atari Inc. Corporate Research at one time long ago was talking
	about a similar idea (but without the MIDI-out or the advantage of
	being able to multi-track with a polyphonic Yamaha chip.)  But you
	can't patent an idea, and although it would be tacky for us to use
	the same name, Hummer, that they were using, so sue us.

		A thornier problem is the fact that our current Yamaha contract,
	and presumably any future one we sign to purchase the cheaper chip,
	explicitly prohibits us from competing with Yamaha in the consumer
	music market.  Ideally what would happen would be that we would design
	the product, do a non-disclosure agreement with them, demonstrate the
	product, and market the product as a joint venture using Yamaha's name
	and distribution channels.  This is tricky, but I'm naive enough to
	think it could happen this way.  The obvious question is what keeps
	them from taking the idea and doing it on their own, and the obvious
	answer is - not much.  Still, we would be saving them from having to
	waste time going through the whole engineering development cycle.  
	They've used independant programmers in the U.S before to write
	computer music software that they could have written themselves.

		We wouldn't be in much of a bargaining position concerning 
	price, but we could always bluff that we could use some other chip
	that's almost as good.  If worst came to worst, we could either find 
	some other chip that's almost as good, or market the device primarily 
	as a MIDI-controller.  At least we would still have a product, although
	the market would be smaller. 

5.	Resources and time frame

	I currently have time-domain pitch and amplitude analysis software
running on the Sound Processing System.  This would need to be considerably
tightened up and tested, and the algorithms transferred to 6502.  Most of the
6502 development could be done with a System I or System II board, with an A-D
input added.  Final development would need the actual target hardware, with the
cheap Yamaha chip in place of the one we are currently using.  Dennis Harper is
interested in doing the 6502 code, fortunately, and I can do most of the
hardware design, as long as there are real engineers around to answer questions.

	1. Project initiation meeting, and demonstration of
		humming, analysis, resynthesis and
		overdubbing with the Yamaha chip	   -	2-3 weeks

	1. Modification and testing of analysis algorithms -	1-2 months
	
	2. 6502 development (concurrent with hardware)	   -	3 months?

	3. Slack					   -	1-2 months

   I think the Hummer concept is a neat idea (even with that name) and am
looking forward to seeing and hearing more about it when you're ready to
demonstrate it.  I think it's great that you (and others) are being
creative in looking for technologically-related opportunities.  With that
attitude and initiative, I'm confident that we as an Engineering company
can continue to be sucessful regardless of what happens to the "industries"
around us.  (How's that for a fool-hardy statement??)  Anyway, keep on
hummin'.

The Approved Vendors List will be moved from CHARM to ERNIE sometime
between noon and 1PM on Tuesday.

If you have defined a word in your LOGIN.COM file to access the
AVL, you may have to make a modification to it..

Users with accounts on remote nodes (CHARM, or KIM)

Type "SET HOST ERNIE" and login to ERNIE as "READAVL" (no password 
required).  When you exit READAVL, you will be returned to your
default node and directory.
You may copy ERNIE::SYS$USERDISK:[AVL]READAVL.COM to your directory and define
a word in your LOGIN.COM file to execute it.
Example: $AVL :==@READAVL.COM

Users with accounts on ERNIE:

Type "@ATARI$AVL:LOGIN" at the VAX system prompt ($), or just add the line
below to your LOGIN.COM file and then type "AVL" after your next login.

                       $ AVL :==@ATARI$AVL:LOGIN


Both of these methods will execute a menu driven program that will allow you
to search the AVL and either save the results in a file in your own directory
(if it's on ERNIE) or forward the results to your remote mailbox.

Subj:	AMOA NEWS FLASH


  We're just back from AMOA and haven't had much time yet to really sort out
all our thoughts and impressions and numerical results (number of games
sold, etc., etc.), but there are some things that are so obvious to all who
were there that I feel obliged to pass them on immediately.  Without a  
doubt, Gauntlet was the runaway HIT of the show. And if Gauntlet was a "10",
there wasn't even anything close to being a "9".  In the entire 12 years of
my association with Atari (and in attending the majority of trade shows
that took place during those 12 years), I think it's safe to say that we 
have never had a more enthusiastic positive reaction to a product than we
had to Gauntlet.  Please accept the sincere thanks from an Atari loyalist
to all of you who helped make the design, manufacturing, and sale of this
product possible.  I really wished every Atari employee could have been at
the show in person, because then you could really have appreciated the often-
expressed comment of operators and distributors alike: "It's sure good to
see Atari back on top again where they belong."  Even competitors were
surprisingly complementary in a very positive way: "It's good to see a game
like Gauntlet putting such a spark of excitement back into an industry
that's been in hibernation for the last couple years."
   Reports of initial collections in the > $1,000 per week range were common
on the show floor, as operators compared notes with us and other operators
on what their very early testing results had been on Gauntlet.  The highest
reported earnings came from a mall arcade in Toronto, Canada, which had 
received their first Gauntlet 10 days before the AMOA Show began.  The
game had AVERAGED $500. PER DAY, earning $4500. in its first 9 days on 
location.  Needless to say, this operator was quite satisfied with his
"projected" ROI on Gauntlet. 
   As I said earlier, Gauntlet was clearly perceived as the runaway "10"
of the show.  Listed below are my personal ratings of the "8"s, "7"s, and
"6"s as I saw it.  There were also probably another 20 to 30 "5's and 
under" beyond these, but I won't go to the trouble of listing them here.
For a complete report and brochures on all that various products that were
shown, see the '85 AMOA binder that I will be circulating thru-out the
company in the next couple weeks.

The "8"s:
1. Atari's "Temple of Doom"
2. Sega's "Choplifter"
3. Cinematronics "World Series"
4. Bally's "Sarge"
5. Konami's "Rush'N'Attack"
6. William's "Comet" Pinball

The "7"s:
1. Taito's "Legend of Kage"
2. Taito's "Knuckle Joe"
3. Data East's "Shootout"
4. Capcom/Romstar's "Gunsmoke"

The "6"s:
1. Taito/Digital Control's "Ghosts'n'Goblins"
2. Taito/Memetron's "Mat Mania"
3. Nichibitsu's "Terra Cresta"
4. Exidy's "Crack Shot"
5. Capcom/Romstar's "Tiger-Heli"
6. Bally/Sente's "Mini-Golf"
7. Data East's "Ring King"
8. Nintendo's "Arm Wrestling"

The "Specials":
1. Taito's "Super Dead Heat" - 4 player 4-monitor driving game ala Sprint 4
2. Taito's "N.Y. Captor" - long distance (6-10 ft) video shooting game
3. Tatsumi/Data East's "Speed Buggy" - 3-monitor driving game ala TX-1
4. Bally/Sente's "4-Player Hat Trick" - Indy 4 style cabinet
5. Bally/Sente's "Stompin" - Nolan finally got someone to do his "foot-
                             control dance machine"
6. Bally/Sente's "Sacman" - a generic Sac-1 kit to convert Pacman games
7. Nintendo's Pac Kit - a generic Uni-system to convert Pacman games

   Please remember, the above lists are only my personal subjective opinions, 
and based on past precedents, are probably not very accurate.  The only things
I am clearly sure of (from my typical Atari objective viewpoint) is that there
was nothing there that came close to competing with Gauntlet, and nothing there
that I felt was a better second than Temple.  Product sales have clearly
justified my appraisal of Gauntlet.  I'm still waiting to see if they'll do
the same on Temple.

The intermetrics library utility used to create a new version of the library
file every time a modification was made to it. However now Intermetrics, in
their infinite wisdom have decided to just update the existing version, nice!
However the jerks leave a corrupted library file if CLBR is interrupted,

Subj:	Upload for AMS 68010 emulator


Have you ever wanted to get hardcopy from your DTB, DT or UPL's.
Well now is your lucky day. 

When you need a DTB hardcopy, for instance, type:-

$ UPL fred.txt
Uploading text from AMS to file fred.txt, Type Control Z to terminate

Then type <ESC><ESC> to get back to the AMS and do:-

> ON CPY

To enable the auto upload. Now everything that appears on your terminal will
also go to the VAX.

So:-

> DTB 0 TO #200

will send the last 200 lines of disassembled trace buffer to fred.txt.

Once you have done everthing you want type:-

> OFF CPY

to disable the upload, then:-

> TRA

to get back to the VAX. Hit control Z and UPL will write all captured data to
the file fred.txt:-

Writing captured data to file fred.txt. Please wait....
Upload written to file fred.txt

$ 

The file fred.txt will be a standard VAX text file, all control characters will
be stripped from the input stream, and only linefeeds will cause a newline.
 This procedure can be used to capture anything from the AMS that you can 
get it to send to the terminal.

*******************************************************************************
P.S.
If for some reason you want a binary file with all data as it appears in 
the input stream, type:-

$ UPL - fred.dat
Uploading binary from AMS to file fred.dat, Type Control Z to terminate

Now all data in the input stream will go to fred.dat. But remember that some
control characters will be trapped by VMS. (ie ^Y, ^C, ^S, ^Q etc.)
and ^Z of course will still terminate the input stream.

To be really perverse and capture all binary data you must set your term to
PASTHRU. See HELP SET TERM/PAS. But BEWARE!!!!!!

Subj:	You wanna help with debug...

Announcing the long awaited program LLF (Link/Locate/Format) program. It appears
to work, but until everybody tries all their perversions on it, I won't know if
I caught all the bugs. It measures about 5 times faster (elapsed time) than the
Intermetrics CLNK/CLOC/CFOR/GENSYM operation. I'm not sure how it matches up to
CLNK/CLOC/QDF. I'm still working on it (evenings and weekends), so additional
features and bug fixes will be addressed reasonably quickly.

Minor enhancments to be added:
	symbol cross reference (for both defined and undefined symbols).
	additional filename input via the option file.
Major enhancment to be added:
	System II support (accepting BLISS-16's output).

To use it, do the usual @CDEFS that you've grown to known and love, then type
(or have your makefile type):

	$ LLF file1[,file2,...][/qualfier...]

Where file1...filen are your input filenames and /qualifier is one or more
qualifiers. 
	
Command line restrictions:
DCL allows up to 1024 characters for the command line with the following
requirements: There be no more than 128 total elements (filenames,qualifiers,
etc.); That any one element have no more than 255 characters; That the
command line consist of NO MORE than 256 characters before being continued
to additional lines (sorry, Greg).

The following qualifiers can appear anywhere on the command line:

	Qualifiers		Default value	What it is, man
	------------------	--------------	-------------------------
	/OUTPUT[=filename]	SYS$DISK:[].HEX	output filename. This is
						defaulted and the name
						defaults to the same as the
						first input filename with a
						file type of .HEX.

	/MAP[=filename]		SYS$DISK:[].MAP	map output filename. The
						filename defaults to the
						OUTPUT filename with a file
						type of .MAP.

	/SYM[=filename]		none		Symbol name output. If this
						option is used with no value,
						then the symbols are included
						in the output (.HEX) file. If
						a value is supplied, then it
						becomes the name of a file into
						which the symbols are placed.
						The default file type in that
						case is .SYM.

	/SEC[=filename]		none		Section name output. If this
						option is used with no value,
						then the section names are
						included in the output (.HEX)
						file. If a value is supplied,
						then it becomes the name of a
						file into which the section
						names are placed. The default
						file type in that case is .SEC.

The following qualifiers must be placed on their specific input filenames to
identify the contents of that file:

	Qualifier		Why I have to type this crap
	-----------		-----------------------------
	/LIB			Identifies the file as being a library file.
				The default file type assumed is .LIB.

	/OPT			Identifies the file as being an option file.
				The default file type assumed is .OPT. At
				present, only 1 option file is accepted.

All input filenames other than those identifed with a /LIB or /OPT have a
default file type of .OL.

The options file contents is nearly the same as the .LC file used with CLOC
the difference being that LLF doesn't support the MEMORY command (yet).

Examples:

	$ LLF game,main,interrupt,vectors,data1,data2	!simple link/loc/form
	$ LLF game,interrupt,data/map/sym		!give symbols and map
	$ LLF /out=alice mary,jane,karen/lib,fun/opt
	$ LLF game,main,lib1/lib,lib2/lib,interrupt,vectors,lib3/lib

Subj:	Yet another TPU section file...


There's a new TPU section file in UTL$EXE:. I also made some updates to the
UTL$COM:EDTINIT.TPU file that turn on the "new" features of the section
file. The new features in the section file are non-destructive, but the
updated EDTINIT file disables PF2 and GOLD/PF2 (the graztifratz HELP keys).
Take note if your using that init file.

The new feature:

	Line mode command:	ERROR [filename]

which reads the file into the aux_buffer and positions the window over the first
occurance of an error message. The cursor stays in the main window. The filename
is optional and defaults to the name of the file in the main_buffer with a .LIS
extension. The EDTINIT file examines the main input file type and sets a string
that is used as an error message search string (i.e. %CC, %MACRO, etc.). Then
the PF2 key is defined to be 'find next error'. Pressing the PF2 key will scroll
the aux_window to the next occurance of the error string. The direction of the
scroll is determined by the current_direction flag (set by the KP4 and KP5
keys). The line mode ERROR command can be abbreviated to no fewer than two
letters (or else it becomes an EXIT!).

FYI: the file fetch uses the GOLD/I mechanism, so if the aux_buffer has data
in it, TPU may prompt for permission to blow away the old contents (a file
entered via a GOLD/U will automatically be written out).

   This is probably the toughest piece of VAXMAIL I've ever had to send, so 
please bear with me if I'm not too eloquent.
   As many of you know, George Opperman was admitted to El Camino Hospital
this past Sunday morning.  He was diagnosed as having lung cancer in a very
advanced stage.  I have just been informed by his family that he passed
away shortly before noon today.
   George's family (wife Pat, son Kevin, and daughter Heather) were able to
spend the last couple days at his side.  Other than some shortness of breath
and a raspy voice, the last few days were quite miraculously pain-free, and
he was able to enjoy the time with his family and many close friends and
fellow workers who dropped by to encourage him.  He and his family were
especially grateful for this, and Pat has asked me to pass on her thanks
to all of his "family" here.  
   The family will not be making any final arrangements until Friday, but
according to Pat, they will probably be scheduling a Memorial Service for
some time early next week (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday).  I will try and
let everybody know the details of this by first thing Monday morning.  I
believe Tuesday will be the most likely day for this to be scheduled.
   Few people have given as much of their life to a company as George gave
to Atari, and even fewer will leave behind the marks of permanence and
beauty and art that 
George was able to leave.  His going will leave a big hole in the lives of
his family, his friends, his fellow workers, and a significant number of
other people who were touched by his role here at Atari.
   George's family's home address, where they will all be for the next week or
two is:      5869 Amapola Drive
             San Jose, Ca. 95129
I'm sure they would all appreciate your thoughts and your prayers.

Subj:	P___ing in the soup


	This is addressed to the person or persons who find it
really amusing to dial up the paging port and blast us all out
with "music" (or should I say Musak) or "Speech chip test?".

	The ability to use dial up paging is very valuable to
some of us, and very likely to be eliminated if much more of this
B.S. goes on. Perhaps you never work late and need to find a co-
worker, perhaps you are always in your office when anyone needs to
find you. Many of us do depend on paging and found it a real hassle
to live without it, as we will be again.

	When we first had this option, many years ago, we also had
a tacit agreement of "one paging joke per person per week". As I
remember it, this worked out pretty well, especially since the jokes
were verbal (hence identifiable) and really poor quality jokesters
got straightend out by peer pressure. Of course, since you have opted
for anonymous aural grafitti, we don't know who you are (yet) and must
fume in silence (so far).

	In short: fun is fun, but have a little class and please don't
screw it up for the rest of us.

	This is to lend weight to Mike's soapbox with some factual
information.  The phone system has been under construction for the
last two months, with various details being nailed down along the way.
Paging should have been nailed down well over two months ago, but there
was a political debate on the merits and demerits of public access
to paging.  It is still underway, which is why the paging access numbers
have not been published (officially).  Obviously, there is a leak.

	It is occasions when a select few demonstrate their lack of
restraint that will (I GUARANTEE) blow it for everyone.  It is also
conceivable that access to the page will be granted/denied on an
individual basis, and that abuse will only harm oneself.  To some
of us (myself included) public access to the page is a valuable
asset.  If you disagree, do so in person, without using the page to
contact me.

	I've never heard Jed say it, but "Thank you or else".

Subj:	Phones


There are a number of problems with the phone system. In order to save
your time sending messages telling us and to save our time reading
messages telling us, I'll point out some of the known bugs. Steve is
off at Rolm school this week to learn how to make moves and changes
(MAC class), so some of these problems can BEGIN to be fixed next
week.

	Lab phones can't dial external numbers. This is a Bob Frye
	"feature". All telephones that weren't explicitly assigned
	to a warm body, were setup with the lowest class of
	service. We think this sucks. You think this sucks.
	Actually, the telephones that should have this class of
	service are the lobby phones here and at 735 and maybe a
	few others. This is entirely a software function so we can
	fix it once we know how.

	The buttons on some ETS's don't match up to the functions
	they perform. This is a hardware problem. We have a bag of
	buttons and are making some progress at correcting this
	error. If you are one of these "ETS" people, happen to
	know your phone number and what the buttons are supposed
	to do, drop on by and we may be able to give you the
	buttons so you can fix it yourself. In the meantime,
	bear with us, we'll get to you.

	There may be one or more PacBell trunks with a problem
	or one or more of our Rolm trunk circuits with a problem
	such that outside calls appear noisy and/or with reduced
	volume. This is a hardware problem. We'll investigate this
	further and call in the appropriate people to correct it.

	The system hold time to too short. If you place a call on
	hold and don't re-connect it within a system wide time
	limit, the Rolm switch will call you back. It appears this
	time is nearer 1 minute than to the more desireable 5 minutes.

	Calls are arbitrarily attached to the page. This problem is not
	new and is because the page system is a kludge as far as the
	Rolm switch is concerned. The fix seems to me to be simple, but
	I'll bet that it can't be done. You can flash any telephone by
	momentarily holding down the switchook and flashing a call will
	place it on hold. Then if you hang up, the Rolm will immediately
	call you back. If someone calls the page then hangs up with either
	type of flash (either switchook or FLASH button), the Rolm will
	call them back connecting them back to the page. I think that
	if the switchook flash were disabled system wide most of this
	page problem could be solved. We're working on it.

	Pick groups are all screwed up. This is a software function and
	can BEGIN to be fixed next week. In the meantime, use * 3 number
	to pick up other phones.

	The page system is sometimes abused. This is a user function and
	we can't fix it. The best we can do is tell you from which
	telephone(s) these abusive pages are coming and let you figure
	out who the offending individual(s) is(are).

If anyone has regularly gotten a busy tone immediately after dialing a 9
for an outside line, please notify me. This may be another problem that
needs to be addressed.

If, when making an OUTGOING call, you experience weak volume and/or high
background noise, please dial FLASH * 563. This will record in the Rolm's
error log all the circuits used in your connection. We need this information
in order to find the trouble (if any). Please don't use this unless your
connection is really "not normal". Thanks in advance.

Subj:	Greenhill's compiler gotme


	Option '-x6' is useful for debugging because it forces the use of the
easily patchable 'mov #0,x' instead of the quicker 'clr x'.
	Unfortunately, option '-x6' ALSO forces the default output suffix to
be '.a68' instead of '.s'.  So if you expect the '.a68' or '.s' extension,
beware of changing '-x6' for debugging/speedup purposes.
	Note: Apparently(?), '-x29' overrides some of this, forcing the
extension to be '.asm'. If so, then '-x6' would again be available for purely 
debugging/code-compacting purposes.

	I walk in the door and smell the adhesives, the carpet outgassing and 
all the other chemicals which are in the air due to the recent, massive 
remodeling.  About 30 minutes later I get an annoying headache, take some 
aspirin, take some more a few hours later ... go home and the headache goes 
away.  
	Please let me know whether or NOT you have similar sensations.  
	I'll collect your messages and send them on to the right person.

Perhaps, if the gases are what's really doing it, we can get the ventillation 
turned up during this initial period when the building is outgassing. Then my
headache and yours can go away.

Subj:	BCP Utility


Thanks to Jim Morris, there is a new Graphics Utility available to scale, yaw,
or pitch a picture(s).  Scaling can be used to magnify or reduce a picture, yaw
or pitch rotates a picture about the Y or X axis contained within the plane
of the picture (standard Cartesian Coordinate alignment).  For location and
documentation, see below.

The exe file is in SYS$USERDISK:[PPS.UTILITIES]BCP.EXE both on nodes KIM::
and CHARM::.  The documentation file is in the same place, called BCP.DOC.

******************************************************************************

BCP will yaw, pitch or scale a PK4 file. NOTE: a .PK4 format is equivalent to
a .INT format.  The operations required to be done on a frame are explicitly
entered in a command file.  The format of this command file follows:

The following must be put at the start of the file in this order:-
  input filename(.pk4) output filename(.pk4)
  input frame size (width height)
  Output frame size (width height)
  number of frames in file

The following are optional and tell BCP what to do with each frame:-
  !		- comment to end of line
  p n.n		- pitch n.n degrees
  y n.n		- yaw n.n degrees
  s n.n		- scale down to n.n% of original size
  d		- write picture to file
  e		- end of command list

The d command must be used to write the resultant picture to the output file.
After the d command any operation is performed on the original frame,
(NOT the result of the previous command).

Examples:-

TESTIN TESTOUT
64 64
64 64
1
! start of test scale frame down 50%, then display it.
s 50.0 d
! yaw frame 25.5 degrees then display it
y 25.5 d
! pitch frame 10.5 degrees, then yaw 22.4 degrees then scale down by 22.5%
p 10.5 y 22.4 s 22.5 d
e

The preceding example does the commented operations on one frame in TESTIN.PK4
and outputs the results to file TESTOUT.PK4

The frame is 64 by 64 pixels and so will the output be.

A new TPU section file has been placed in utl$exe. This file fixed two
small bugs:

	1) a SET SCREEN now affects the main, message and aux windows
		(previously the aux_window wasn't changed)
	2) the "short cut" GOLD/W (GOLD/{up} or GOLD/{down} when
		only 1 window is displayed) has been fixed. This used
		to produce the error "unable to operate on invisible
		window". 

If you have been using the standard TPU calling conventions, you needn't
do anything different to access this section file.

Subj:	Book review


	For those of you who will be sitting around bored with nothing to
do during vacation, I have the perfect gift suggestion for yourself - an
876-page book!  (I'm only up to page 650, but I find myself limiting it to
a chapter a night to make it last longer.)  It's called The Mists of Avalon,
by Marion Zimmer Bradley.  I know a lot of people who've finished it, and
they all say the ending is great.

	Basically it's the story of the Arthur legend, with Merlin and 
Lancelet and Gwenhwyfar (a lot of the names are spelled different), Camelot
and the Round Table and the Quest for the Grail.  But it's all different.
It's told primarily from the perspective of the women involved, especially
Morgaine, Arthur's sister who is trained as a priestess on the island of
Avalon.  The basic theme is the battle for Arthur's mind during the 
transition from the Celtic/pagan/nature/Goddess religion of ancient Britain
f
oops -  to the Christian religion, which strives to drive the "evil" goddess
out of Britain.  Arthur is sworn to defend Avalon, which gave him Excalibur,
the magic sword which protects him from harm.  When he breaks this pledge,
Avalon must either persuade him to follow his oath, or overthrow him.

	The book gives you the feeling that this is the way the story really
happened, and that "sword in the stone" and similar versions is how the story
was rewritten by the winners.  This book is very rich, the characters are
utterly real, the ideas are fascinating, and the atmosphere is magic.

	There are a couple of real reviews (without typos) on the Audio
group bulletin board.

Subj:	"FEATURED FEATURE" feature


	Hi.  As you may have noticed, we have a new phone system in place.
While there are some real problems with it (surprize!), many problems can
be avoided by knowing a little more about the system.  To help spread the
knowledge, I plan on publishing a semi-regular newsletter (like this one)
which has a "featured feature".  I will try to discuss a problem or issue
that is of interest to the most people at that time--second-guessing what
would be the most common question or complaint.

	The first featured feature is COMPLAINTS, QUESTIONS, and CHANGES.
(How's that for second-guessing?)

	To start with:  The primary "phone guy" is me, Steve Suttles.  I
worked with people from Atari and with Rolm, trying to set up the system
as closely as possible to what we needed.  I work for Dave Shepperd, who
runs the computer systems group (in engineering).  It is our group that is
responsible for the care and feeding of the telephone system, since it is
actually a computer running the show.  The "pecking order" for phone work
is: Steve Suttles, Dave Shepperd, Stephanie Mott, and Mike Albaugh.  There
shouldn't be any long time when you can't reach any of us, but we are known
to go out to lunch once in a great while.

	As I mentioned, I specified to Rolm how the phone system was to
operate.  Of course, needs change, and by the time the system was ready to
be installed, there were several changes already pending.  Also, there were
a lot of things we did wrong, or we didn't get the right information, or I
made assumptions that were not justified.  Which brings us to questions
and changes.

	My extension is 1710.  If you call me, I will answer questions as
well as I can.  If you call me and ask for a change, I will tell you that
I will do it (because I intend to) and then forget (because I get a LOT of
phone calls).  SO, if you really want the change(s) made, I need something
in writing so that I can use it to remind myself.  For those of you with
VAXMAIL capability, you can send mail to (KIM::)ROLM.  Our group watches
the mailbox and we will check it out when something shows up.  If you aren't
hooked up to the vax, send me (Steve Suttles @675, NOT ROLM!) a note saying
what you want done.  If I disappear (vacation or some such nonsense), our
group will still pick it up.

	Changes:  Any phone or phone number in the system can be made to
look/act/work like any other.  While there are obvious differences between
the single-line phones and the electronic telephone sets (ETS), they have
essentially the same capability.  So if you would like to have your phone
do what someone elses does, there shouldn't be a problem.  For example,
if your phone doesn't system-forward after 3 rings, and you would like it
to, it is simply a matter of telling the phone system that your phone should
do that.  If I am unable to make a change you request, I will let you know
why, and suggest whatever alternatives might be helpful.


		Looking forward (fearfully) to hearing from you,

		Steve Suttles
