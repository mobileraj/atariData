Driver Release Documentation
----------------------------
I have been spending an enormous amont of time on this.


DSPLINK
-------
It works during Self-Test but screws up with Ed's code. I cannot
fix it by making program changes, blowing boot ROMs, and trying it out.

Matt and Peter have started working on it. < They have an emulator.>


Memory Expansion Board (Bonnie's PC Board)
------------------------------------------
I have given the inputs to PC. Leon estimates three weeks.

When fully loaded, Bonnie's PCB will have:

	1.25M Bytes of EPROM (10 x 27C010-170)
	64K Bytes of RAM
	4K Bytes of ZeroPower RAM with Software Write Protect.
	Driver P15 System

More to Do:
	Program the GAL address decoders;
	Write Self-Test for this board.


DS III
------
I have given the inputs to PC. Art estimates it will take four weeks for
schematic entry and board layout.

More To Do:
	Program the GALs;
	Write Self-Test.

X2 Programmer
-------------
Wednesday, Jan 2, 1991: 
	Received the PC Boards.

	I called Melanie about the Yamaichi sockets. She checked and found 
	out that the Purchase Req (signed off on 12/5/90) had only 
	that day arrived in Purchasing. 

	Yamaichi was doing inventory that week but promised to send them the 
	next week (1/8/91).

Wednesday, Jan 9, 1991:
	I called Melanie about the Yamaichi sockets. She checked and found 
	out that Yamaichi had sent them to the wrong company. Perhaps I
	will get them tomorrow.

Total Delivered		 2789


In January, as of 1/17/91 we have received 104 + 255 + 27 = 386 blank parts 
to program, and have delivered 359, with 24 bad parts.


Bad Parts:
	10 first batch
	40 various
	18 various		
	18 program 
	24 non-blank
	13 prog
	10 non-blank (to give to Bob Stewart)
       ----
       133 total bad parts	(total of 53 were received non-blank)

I believe I have been able to salvage 19 parts


Total Parts= 2941
Good parts = 2808
Bad Parts  =  133  = 4.52% failure rate

39.8% of the bad parts were due to being received non-blank.


Read This
----------
In order to evaulate the bad parts and put some together for Bob Stewart I
needed more labels.

When Jim Freitas gave me the labels he remarked that they had run out of
teeny tiny labels and had given me merely tiny labels.

In his presence I tried one out on one of the bad parts I was bringing
Bob Stewart and it was apparent that the new label will have to cover either 
the part number or the copyright notice. (Dennis Wood has decreed that we 
are not to cover the copyright notice.)

At this point I realized that I was looking at a Texas Instruments Logo on
our part. I know that we specifically told them that their logo was not to
appear on the part. (Erik has since pointed out that the TI logo is molded
into the bottom of the plastic parts.)

									3 of 3

Units with this parts labeled this way have almost certainly been shipped. 

TI has compromised half the security we had hoped to derive from using their
part. I recommend that this part not be used for security after Race Drivin'
and that TI be informed of the reason for making the decision.

 
DSPLINK
-------
I have two wire-wrap boards for Peter and Matt which I have to bring up.


Memory Expansion Board (Bonnie's PC Board)
------------------------------------------
Leon is working on it.

More to Do:	Program the GAL address decoders;
		Write Self-Test for this board.

DS III
------
Joe is working on it.

More To Do:	Program the GALs;
		Write Self-Test.

Max insisted that a wire-wrap of the graphics section be done, so one
is being done.

 
X2 Programmer
-------------
I received the Yamaichi sockets thanks to actions by Melanie above and
beyond the call of duty.

Karen made three boards and they seem to work. I have done the software
to run the boards (which are single-module boards).

The board is ready to be used.


Data I/O
--------
Someone from Data I/O called me and we discussed their P15 problem. He 
understood why what I wanted is important and will pass it on to the
technical people.

It still isn't clear if their unique foam socket system can be made to work.


Driver Documentation
--------------------
I will work on it if I ever have time.

Re: Prototype PC Boards
Dt: 1/23/91


We are getting ready to order prototype PC Boards for the
Expanded Memory Board and for the DS III Board.

It is very important that they NOT be ordered from Cirexx.

The last two boards that I have gotten from Cirexx were the
DS II Board and the DSK Board. These boards were awful.

The DS II Boards had several shorts from signal layers to the inside
power supply layers; I have DSK Boards that Erik and I still can't get to 
work no matter what we do.

Dealing with poor quality prototype boards wastes an enormous amount of
time.

The new X Programmer boards (the X2) seem to be very good. The name on it
is "SK" . Maybe we can order the boards from these people.


Regards,


Jed

DSPLINK
-------
I have brought up the two partyline wire-wrap boards for Peter and Matt and
am having Emmette make two more. I am buying more line buffer parts for these 
boards and for the DS III boards.


Memory Expansion Board (Bonnie's PC Board)
------------------------------------------
Leon is working on it. No work could be done on it Monday and Tuesday because
Ernie$Userdisk was down. After that, Leon was pulled off the board to work
on BatMan. I don't know when it will get done.

More to Do:	Program the GAL address decoders;
		Write Self-Test for this board.

on the BatMan Sound Board. I don't know when it will get done.


More To Do:	Program the GALs;
		Write Self-Test.

I have gotten the wire-wrap of the graphics section back; I will have to
program the GALs before it can be used. If Max wants to use it anytime soon
it will be without much Self-Test.
 

Driver Documentation
--------------------
I have been working on it.


Plus Logic Field Programmable Gate Arrays
-----------------------------------------
The latest quote is for $30.00 for quantity 500 in 1991 Q4. This is higher
than the $16.00 that the salesman talked about earlier.

I also have not received the information I requested on programming the 
device. They recommend the Data I/O Unisite ($17K).

I am planning on giving them their evaluation software back and dropping
them from consideration for now.


Triac Motor Amp
---------------
Erik is working with Emmette in getting one built.

Re: Status Report
Dt: 30 January 1991


We have released all the versions of Race Drivin' Link.

But, since we have run out of Slapstic 17 we have to do it over again.

The remaining Slapstics are Slapstic 15; the software will be changed so
it will work with either one. This means that Self-Test will be backwards 
compatible with all existing versions of Race Drivin'.


Race Drivin' Link Parts Lists II		
--------------------------------
The fourteen (to twenty) Parts Lists to be ECNed are as follows 
(date indicates when given to Art to release):

New Whole Games:

	Cockpit:		North American	A045988-05	
				British		A045988-07	
				German		A045988-06	

	Compact:		North American	A046901-04	
				British		A046901-05	
				German		A046901-06	


The kits that need to be ECNed are the ones that convert Hard Drivin' to
Race Drivin' Link since Hard Drivin' was shipped without a Slapstic.

	Hard Drivin' to Race Drivin' Link
	Cockpit Kit:		North American	A048486-01	
				British		A048486-02

	Hard Drivin' Compact to Race Drivin' Link Compact
	Compact Kit:		North American	A048984-01	
				British		A048984-02	
				German		A048984-03	

These kits have the Slapstic called out on a different parts list, so they
must also be changed:

	ASSY, RACE DRIVIN' KIT			A048810-XX

	ASSY, KIT LIST, COMPACT			A048850-01


		WARNING   WARNING   WARNING
		-------   -------   -------
Kit List A048850-01 (Compact Hard Drivin' to Race Drivin' Link) does not have
a Slapstic on it. Therefore, any of these kits that have already been shipped
WILL NOT WORK.

									2 of 2

The kits that convert Race Drivin' to Race Drivin' Link presumably do not
need to be changed, since they go only to people who already have Race Drivin'
which means they already have a Slapstic 17 on their board. If, however, you
want them changed anyway, let me know.

Re: Status Report
Dt: 31 January 1991


	I have had an exploratory meeting with Philip King of
ASIC Technical Solutions (ATS) and Mark Kuligowski of Premier
Technical Sales.

	ATS does ASICs for people using standard cell technology.

	Inputs can be: 
	   1. Customer supplies schematics and test vectors;

	   2. Customer supplies schematics and test vectors using
		   ATS software ($7K).

	   3. Customer supplies layout data, simulation vectors, and 
	      results. Presumably the $7K software will get you this far.

	The customer receives a prototype of the design in an ACTEL FPGA
	(which runs at a slower maximum speed than the real ASIC).
		       
I asked them to talk to Don Paauw to get the size of the TWIG and Phil
called me back to report that they would be happy to do one from our
schematics for NRE of $12K and:

	  1K: about $3.00	    10K: $2.50

For $12K we would get 12 prototypes.


National Semiconductor is currently the sole source of TWIGs. Several
months ago they announced their intention to get out of the ASIC
business. They have stopped taking orders for new ASICs and although they
have promised to continue making old ASICs I beleive it is only a matter 
of time before they shut it down completely.


The TWIG is used on the Driver Main Board and on the MultiSync Board.
Besides Race Drivin', the MultiSync Board is used on Cyclotron and
NoName.

The TWIG has no application other than with the 34010; future designs
would use the 34020 and would not use the TWIG.

The questions are:
 
	1. Do you think we will stop using the TWIG before National stops 
	   making them?

	2. If not, do we want to do something about it before it happens
	   and we are left high and dry?

	3. Is ATS an appropriate company to do business with?

Re: Status Report
Dt: 8 February 1991


We have released all the versions of Race Drivin' Link affected by the 
Slapstic change. The only versions not changed were those to convert
Race Drivin' to Race Drivin' Link since they already have Slapstic 17.

The new release works with either Slapstic 17 or Slapstic 15 with no
Operator action required.

I gave the inputs to Art on Monday Feb 4 and signed off the parts lists
on Thursday Feb 8. I also gave inputs to Ralph for his parts lists om
Monday. I don't know if he has taken care of it yet.

DS III Boards
-------------
The boards are on order. I have given Karen the parts list and asked her to
get the parts ahead of time. I don't want to to get caught short when Tom 
Smith closes things done for inventory.

The schematics that the PC Group produces with ViewLogic are unacceptable. 
The features are too small to read by a person with normal eyesight. I have
suggested how they can fix the problem but they refuse to try it.

The parts lists that the PC Group produces with ViewLogic are unacceptable.
I had to generate my own parts list for the DS III board in order to cost the 
board and so Karen would have something to work from.

I wonder if the boards by this system will even work.


Memory Expansion Boards
-----------------------
We have received boards and I have given them to Karen to stuff. She expects
to have some ready for me next week.

The boards were designed to use 170 ns 1M EPROMs. According to Mary Burnias
the manufacturer would prefer to sell us 150ns parts because that is the
standard speed for these parts. That is fine with me. I may be be able to 
replace some F245 buffers with LS245s.

Also, Mary deserves special commendation for getting me 75ALS194s and 
75ALS195s last week.

DSPLINK Board

They have either been ordered or are about to be ordered.


TWIG Second Source
------------------
I have asked Philip King of ATS to prepare a proposal for a TWIG
replacement, to include costs and schedules.


Orcad
-----
According to Elcor, Orcad started shipping updates around the end of January.
We should get it soon (if we sent in the registration card).

I have asked for the demo disk for the PCB Layout package.

DSPLINK Boards
--------------
I have given two Party-Line versions to Peter.

With Matt's help I have given Ed Logg two working DSPLINK (old style) Boards.

According to Melanie the PC Boards are not due in until March 19. Film and
Fab were ready in Feb 12. What happened?


ASIC61
------
Mike Felice came in and showed me a copy of what AT&T proposes to do to change
the specs in order to increase their yield.

They want to change the input threshhold for logic '1' from 2.2V to 3.0V on
some of the Host Port signals. Since these are driven by LSTTL gates whose
outputs are not guaranteed for more than 2.4V I told him 'No'.

We would need to add pullup resistors on 7 lines either as a hand operation
or by changing the PC Board. 


Memory Expansion Board
----------------------
Karen has stuffed the nine boards. I have brought up seven of them and will
give six to Bonnie as soon as I receive some instructions regarding the 
Helper. If she is going to use Driver Code for the Helper I will make some. 
If not, not.

Leon screwed up the board by splitting up /32WR0 into /32WR0 and /32WRO which,
of course, were not connected. (0=zero; O=Oh). Also, Leon has chosen to 
do 'not' as an overstrike which means it cannot be precisely referred to in 
an ASCII text file.)

/32WRO connected two inputs together with no driving source. Doesn't Viewlogic
report undriven inputs? OrCard does.


DS III Boards
-------------
Karen has built one and I have started testing it. I expect to have the 
Graphics section Self-Test working this week, depending on how much I
get interrupted.


Orcad
-----
I have received the demo disk for the PCB Layout package and tried it out. I
like it.

When I called OrCad with some questions about the program I also asked about
our update for SDT III. The guy said they had just started shipping updates 
that week.

DSPLINK Boards
--------------
Logg has reported a problem related to the type of interconnect cable used.

The boards that he has are more susceptible to cable capacitance than the 
Party Line boards will probably be, so no action will be taken until we get
the Party Line boards.

Boards are expected on March 19.

I have given Bonnie six boards (two with Helpers) and documentation for same.


DS III Boards
-------------
The graphics section of the first board appears to be working so I have given
it to Matt.

I have brought up another board to the point where the Graphics Section
appears to be working.

I will continue bringing up the DS III board and writing Self-Test.

I have received a notice from Analog Devices that 50 MHz 2101s with a date
code of 9049D or later have a new bug. It seems that when it returns from a
Bus request it incorrectly executes the pending instruction. Matt has more
information. Margot will try to find out when they expect to have Real Parts.

I filled out a Purchase Request for the PCB Layout package which will allow
us to do our own small prototype PC Boards quickly.

Matt,

I have found out what was screwing up DS III Self-Test and might have
something to do with the problem you are having.

A Reset signal must be at least 1000 processor cycles long after powerup
(84 us for a 12 MHz system) and at least 400 ns for a Reset after the
initial powerup Reset. [ADSP-2101 Data Sheet, page 22]

It doesn't say anything about what to do after Reset goes high.

For a system that is going to Boot from ROM, no problem.

For my Self-Test, which is run from external Program RAM, the program 
miraculously runs if I wait a few microseconds before I do anything else
(like generate an IRQ from the Port).

I am waiting 20 us but it seems to work just as well doing:

	CLR.W	GR_RES_H
	JSR	DELAY
	and so on



DELAY:	RTS

I have made new Self-Test ROMs.


Regards,


Jed

DSPLINK Boards
--------------
We have received the PC Boards (a week early) and Karen has stuffed four
for me. I expect to fire them up next week.


Memory Expansion Board
----------------------
I have given Bonnie six boards (two with Helpers) and documentation for same.


DS III Boards
-------------
The graphics section of the first board appears to be working so I have given
it to Matt. He has been able to port the Race Drivin' program over to it and 
it works. He has more things to do on it. I will look into why he seems to 
need to set the Data RAM that shadows the ports to 1 wait state.

I will continue bringing up the DS III board (and writing Self-Test) with the
two additional boards that Karen stuffed for me.

I have received a notice from Analog Devices that 50 MHz 2101s with a date
code of 9049D or later have a new bug. It seems that when it returns from a
Bus request it incorrectly executes the pending instruction. Matt has more
information. I have asked Margot when they expect to have really real parts
but I have not gotten an answer yet.

Some of the problems we have had in bringing up the board are because the
2101 Emulator does not do a good job in getting off the bus in response to
a Bus Request. Matt has an Oops board from Analog Devices that is supposed to
solve the problem but then the unit cannot operate at full speed; however, 
apparently no one over there is willing to say what speed it will operate at.

Moto
----
On Wednesday I attended a meeting with the Motorola rep (Rich Comeau) and the
Field Applications Engineer (Raman Subramanian). Also attending were
Pat McCarthy and his gang and Mike Albaugh. The purpose was to discuss 
possible processors beyond the 68010. 

Motorola has what they are calling the MC68EC020. This is a 68020 with
some of the signals not bonded out in order to save money on packaging.
The device has 32 address lines but only 24 are brought out. (The 68010
is the same way.)

The 68EC020 (68020) has a 32 bit data bus and a 256 byte cache. The 'EC' 
stands for Embedded Controller' and appears to be a marketing ploy directed at
people who think they cannot afford a real microprocessor.

Prices (1K):			16 MHz		25 MHz		# pins
				------		------		------
		68EC020 PGA	$26.90		$32.00		100
			PQFP	$16.90		$22.00		100

		68020	PGA			$56.00		114
			PQFP			$51.00		132

Rich Comeau is getting me a real quote.

There are issues that would have to be addressed, like development systems,
but then, they would have to be addressed by any change of the Main Processor.

By the way, the Microtek tools that we have do support the 68020.

Programmed Parts Series
-----------------------
I have obtained the following Programmed Parts Series numbers:

	Cyclotron	136086-XXXX
	Steel Talons	136087-XXXX
	Panorama	136088-XXXX


DSPLINK Boards
--------------
The four PC Boards Karen made for me work just fine. I have asked her to
make six more. I have documented the differences between the old and the new 
boards. Peter needs six boards next week. I hope to be able to accomodate him.


DS III Boards
-------------
The work that I have done until now has been directed to providing Matt
with a known good board. I am continuing to work on the complete Self-Test
for the board.


GAL6001
-------
Regarding Pat's memo on replacing the Slapstic with a GAL6001.

Two weeks ago I asked Joan for a quote on this part with a copy to be sent to 
Pat. It came in at $5.18 . I told Joan that I was disappointed that it
wasn't closer to the $4 she mentioned a few months ago. She said that 
Lattice's attitude is that it is a sole source part and they see no reason to 
cut the price.

$5.18 seems to be a bit pricey; we were paying $0.23 the last time we bought 
Slapstics.

An alternative might be to do a custom chip with ATS. For $15K and $2.50/chip
we could have something equivalent in capability to the TWIG. An example
is an ASIC implementation of the parallel port used in the DS III and also
as the Helper Interface. It would also contain security circuitry.

Or, are there any other PLDs that can do buried states for less than $5.18?


MANMAN
------
I have had occasion today to look up the inventory status for a particular
part. They have changed the program. It now requires the user to make
several choices of something or other; it cranks for awhile and then delivers
garbage. It also refuses to let the user get out of that particular mode.
You must Control-Y out of MANMAN and run the program again.

This is really infuriating.

Matt,

	I have had the mods done and they seem to work. The board should
work with no wait states.


	Also, the Pod PGA connector came apart when I unplugged it from the 
board. You might want to check that I put it back together the right way.

DS III
------
In going over the new 2101 specs I discovered an error in my circuit,
which I have corrected. The new specs make it possible to operate the port 
with zero wait states. This requires another circuit change that I am making.
 
Dan Ash spent Tuesday afternoon here working with Matt on the Emulator. He
is scheduled to return next week to work on it some more.

According to a letter from Damon Chu, Regional Marketing Manager, Analog 
Devices DSP Division, 50 MHz 2101s have a problem with the Bus Request
operation. 

They claim they will be able to provide us with specially screened parts in 
which the Bus Request works as long as all wait states are 0.

Since the circuit now operates with all wait states set to 0, this seems like
an acceptable solution, especially since, according to Dan Ash, the plans are
to not bring out a new rev until late summer.

I have emphasized to Dan the absolute requirement that this part be given a
part number to distinguish it from the other parts where Bus request does not
work. I have suggested that this part be called an ADSP-2101KP-50-2.


DSPLINK Boards
--------------
I have given Peter six boards. Two have PGA sockets for use with his ICE;
four are PLCC for the Eds' game.

I have also given him a set of documentation including memory map, schematics,
and how the PC Board is different from the WireWrap board.

I have given Ed Logg documentation of memory map and how the PC Board is 
different from the WireWrap board.


Panorama
--------
I have generated the parts lists for Main, MultiSync, ADSP II, and DSK Boards.


PC Boards
---------
	DSPLINK Board will need some touchup before going to Rev A.
	Memory Expansion Board will need some work before it can go to
		Rev A (Leon omitted a trace).
	DS III Board will need somewhat more than touchup. We should go to
		Rev 2 before going to Rev A.

I do not want to give inputs to PC until the boards have been thoroughly 
evaluated by their respective programmers.

DS III Costs
------------
DS III Stuffed to do Graphics only (no Sound, no DSP Link) with	
512K Byte Graphics EPROM (equivalent to 8 27C512 vs. 6 for ADSP II); 

Total Materials: $153.76

The DS III stuffed for Graphics Only should cost $39.17 less than the ADSP II
for what should be at least the same and probably greater performance. This
includes four 1M EPROMs equivalent to eight 27C512s.

The difference between a DS III that does Sound and Graphics and a DS III that
just does Graphics is $221.62 - $153.76 = $67.86 (Material only), and
		      $279.19 - $194.61 = $84.55 (Material+Labor+Overhead).

How much does the SA Audio cost, with ROMs, Labor, and Overhead? 

Here is how it compares:
					Material  Labor   Overhead     Total
					--------  -----   --------    -------
	Driver Sound   A046491-02	$127.40   $6.17   $50.40      $183.97
	ADSP II	       A047046-03	$192.93	  $4.45   $36.40      $233.78
	DS III (Street Driver):		$221.62	  $6.17*  $50.40*     $278.19
	DS III (Graphics Only):		$153.76   $4.45** $36.40**    $194.61


	ADSP II	       A047046-03	$192.93	  $4.45   $36.40      $233.78
	DS III (Graphics Only):		$153.76   $4.45   $36.40      $194.61
					-------   ------  ------     -------
	Savings = 	 		$ 39.17	  $0.00   $0.00       $39.17


	Driver Sound + ADSP II 		$320.33   $10.62  $86.80     $417.75
	DS III		       		$221.62   $ 6.17  $50.40     $278.19
					-------   ------  ------     -------
	Savings = 	 		$ 98.71	  $ 4.45  $36.40     $139.56

* The DS III Board is similar to the Driver Sound Board in size and density.
** The DS III Graphics Only is similar to the ADSP III in size and density.

Power Supply tests so we know what size transformer and capacitors to use:



1. Install 3" wire loop on each 8VAC transformer winding.

2. Use Current Probe connected to Fluke RMS Meter to measure currents.
   (Remember to terminate the current probe amplifier.)

3. Use 'scope to observe power supply outputs and regulator margin.

4. Determine regulator margin with 105 VAC primary power.

32K x 8 SRAMs
-------------
Tom Smith asked me if we could use 70 ns parts instead of 85 ns parts on the
DSK board. He gave me some parts which I tried out in a board (they worked)
so the next day I told him that I would happy to sign a deviation to that 
effect.


Bonnie's Volume Control
-----------------------
I added an entry in Self-Test for her to use to set the game volume.



DSPCOM Board
------------
I propose this as the name for the board with the DSP Link and the Helper.
I have finished the schematics and will give them to PC.

This board will require new GAL programming which I will try to do before
PC finishes the board. (This is to avoid unpleasant surprises.) I expect to
make the DSP Link addressing the same as in the DSPLINK PCB.

This board will also require a bunch of Self-Test.


New United Motor and Fan AMP PCB (NUMAF)
----------------------------------------
I have updated the schematic and done a sample placement of the parts and a 
sample routing (as a 2-layer board) using the Roto-Router.

I created several shapes without having much information, so they may need to 
be redone. Especially the Transformer.

Some things are already apparent:
	1. It would be helpful if the PC group would supply a list of the
	   parameters used for our parts [pad size, drill size, lead spacing].

	2. Ditto on things like:
		a. How close to the board edge can traces be run? 
		b. How close to the board edge can components be mounted?

	3. Logic Power and Ground will need to be routed manually.

	4. Line voltage will need to be routed manually.

DS III
------
I have brought Karen's documentation up to date with the mods and have asked
her to stuff four more boards. She estimates they might be ready by Friday
April 19.


MultiSync Board
---------------
This is the proposal:

	1. Remove the Slapstic and replace it with a GAL6001 programmed to
	   emulate a Slapstic. This is feasible only if Pat McCarthy 
	   agrees to program the parts. He will also have to give me 
	   schematics and pinouts for designing-in the part.

	2. Route the SCOM Interrupt signal through an open collector gate
	   so it can share the LINK_IRQ with the DSPCOM board.

	3. Remove the 12 Bit A/D and install a Motor Amp for the Street 
           Driver. We may also use the Motor Amp port for this purpose.

This board should be useable for Steel Talons, Cyclotron, and Street Driver.
We need to discuss these changes with Bonnie and the EDs.

In the event someone absolutely needs the 12 Bit A/D, changes #1 and #2 will 
be made first, and that board saved on tape. (If it is used it will be given a
different fab assembly number.) Then change #3 will made and that will be the
latest MultiSync. Note that it will be backwards compatible if someone can
program the GAL6001 to be a Slapstic 115 or 117. In fact, that would be a good
test to determine that the GAL6001 can be programmed to emulate a Slapstic.

Because of the addition of the Motor Amp it will be necessary to get prototypes.
We should get a bunch (for the three projects) and have Production build them.

ASIC65s
-------
I have given Mary Burnias 127 bad parts to return to the manufacturer.

Of these parts, about one-third were received non-blank and were not
programmed. Nonethess I set the Security Bit in these non-blank parts
just to be sure, and verified that it was secure.

The remaining two-thirds were programmed to some extent before they failed
program verification. Since there were, in some cases, fragments of code
in them, I set the Security Bit and verified that it was secure.

There were ten parts where the Security Bit did not secure the part. I have
kept these parts. 

There are also about ten parts that might be ok. They need to be tested in 
a DSK board.

I tried running 2 Amps reverse polarity through a part. It still worked
once it had cooled down, so I did not apply this to the 127 parts.


DSPCOM Board
------------
I have gotten the schematics back. I cannot check it because I cannot read
the signal labels. This is important because on the last board Leon did for 
me he did some some labels '0' and some 'O' that were supposed to be the
same label. They did not get connected on the PC board.

His questions about some missing signals would have been answered if he had 
checked it against the input that I gave him.

I have attached the schematics. Please have them checked by someone who can
read them.


New United Motor and Fan AMP PCB (NUMAF)
----------------------------------------
I am continuing to work on it.


DS III
------
I have requested an Atari pn for the selected 2101 (68P,PLCC) that they will
mark as "AD 90461-1".

I have sent Mary Burnias a memo explaining the situation. (Analog Devices
wants a forecast.)

Karen will supposedly have four DS III boards ready on Friday.


Jed


MultiSync Board
---------------
This is the proposal:

	1. Remove the Slapstic and replace it with a GAL6001 programmed to
	   emulate a Slapstic. This is feasible only if Pat McCarthy 
	   agrees to program the parts. He will also have to give me 
	   schematics and pinouts for designing-in the part.

	2. Route the SCOM Interrupt signal through an open collector gate
	   so it can share the LINK_IRQ with the DSPCOM board.

	3. Remove the 12 Bit A/D and install a Motor Amp for the Street 
           Driver. We may also use the Motor Amp port for this purpose.

This board should be useable for Steel Talons, Cyclotron, and Street Driver.
We need to discuss these changes with Bonnie and the EDs.

In the event someone absolutely needs the 12 Bit A/D, changes #1 and #2 will 
be made first, and that board saved on tape. (If it is used it will be given a
different fab assembly number.) Then change #3 will made and that will be the
latest MultiSync. Note that it will be backwards compatible if someone can
program the GAL6001 to be a Slapstic 115 or 117. In fact, that would be a good
test to determine that the GAL6001 can be programmed to emulate a Slapstic.

Because of the addition of the Motor Amp it will be necessary to get prototypes.

Re: Status Report

DSPCOM Board
------------
I have checked the large format schematics and given the corrections to Leon,
who has already done the board.


Motor and Fan Amp
-----------------
I have finished it and prepared a 5 1/4 floppy with what I hope are the 
appropriate Gerber files.

Erik did the Fab drawing on AutoCad and we have apparently gone out for 
boards.

Here is how to get the Orcad Drill Template file into AutoCad:
	1. Set up OrCad PCB to use DXF format for plotting files.
		a. D:>PCB/C 	(setup mode)
		b. PL		(we will select the plotter)
		c. 4		(DXF plot format)
		d. Q		(Quit)
		e. U		(Update)
		f. Q		(Quit)

	2. Plot the Drill Template
		a. Go through the normal procedures to load the board
		   (ex. PCB myboard.brd)
		b. You must set the Plot window to encompass the entire board.
		   (ex. Quit, Plot, Window, Size, A3)
		c. Plot the Drill Template. Give it a DXF file extension.
		   (ex. MB_DT.DXF)

       3. Import it in AutoCad.
       		a. use DXFIN
		b. give filename

If you are going to make Gerber Plot files you must restore PCB Plotter
Default to Gerber.
	a. D:>PCB/C 	(setup mode)
	b. PL		(we will select the plotter)
	c. M		(More)
	c. M		(More)
	c. 17		(GERBER plot format)
	d. Q		(Quit)
	e. U		(Update)
	f. Q		(Quit)


PCB Transformer
---------------
According to Ray Sherman, after you asked him to get data on the Magnetek
transformer, he realized that transformers were the purview of Mr. Owens,
and in fact, turned the job over to him.

Mr. Owens got some data from EEM. On the wrong transformer.

Result: I still have to get the data I need myself, but now, because
the board had to go out with no transformer mounting holes, I am
guaranteed more work later on.


DS III
------
The Atari part numbers for the 2101KP-50 and 2101KG-50 now call out the
selected-out parts (AD 90461-1 and AD 9046-2). The original numbers
have been disqualified.

Karen had the four DS III boards ready on Thursday (a day early). I have
made GALs and will bring up the boards, shortly.


MultiSync Board
---------------
I am waiting for inputs:
	1. Pat's GAL6001 circuit.
	2. What to do about the Motor Amp circuit now that the EDs are
	   using the 12 Bit A/D.

DS III
------
I have brought up four DS III boards and given them to the Eds.

Matt's software conversion seems to work; the DS III boards are running
Steel Talons.

I will try to have two DS II Graphics RAM boards stuffed next week.

I will also convert their Self-Test to do the DS III board. 



Panorama
--------
I have made the required changes to Self-Test.

I have done a preliminary AROMREL.DOC .


Motor and Fan Amp
-------------------
The boards have come in and Karen is making some.

									2 of 2

In order for BMX to be released, the following must be done:


Memory Expansion Board
----------------------
 There is a PC error that must be fixed. 

 PC must generate a useable parts list.


MultiSync
---------
 If BMX is to use the DSPLINK Board, the MultiSync board must be changed.

 The plan is to change the SCOM Interrupt and replace Slapstic with
 Pat's  GAL6001. If these are the only changes, the board will remain
 compatible with Steel Talons and Street Driver. It could also be used
 in Panorama if a GAL6001 can be programmed to behave like a Slapstic 115.

 A new version will have to be created (MultiSync II), documented, and 
 checked. 


ADSP II
-------
 If BMX is to use the ADSP II Board, a new version must be documented.

 If BMX is to use a partially loaded DS III Board, we have to:
    1. Correct the existing Rev 1 Board;
    2. Create an appropriate parts list;
    3. Build and test two DS II RAM Boards so Bonnie can continue development.
        (Both her ADSP II Boards have RAM boards which can only be used with
         ADSP II Boards.)

DSPLINK
-------
  If Bonnie is planning on using it, it has to be released. I don't know if 
  PC has a useable parts list yet.


Motor and Fan Amp
-----------------
The board will have to work.

Dear Karen,


     I need the following parts for the DSPCOM Boards:


	(10) 	137665-1020	ASIC65 (Blank)

	(10)	137674-040	ADSP-2105

	(20)	137646-015	GAL16V8-15 (Blank)


     Please MTO them for me. If you need to charge someone, they are for
Steel Talons 523XX.

I have made the required changes to Self-Test.

I have done a preliminary AROMREL.DOC .


Motor and Fan Amp
-------------------
The boards work although several changes need to be made to adjust hole
sizes and component spacing. We also need to do a filter for the Drive
Motor section.

Bonnie has been given a board.

I have also given her a new Self-Test that handles the new Motor and Fan
Amp Board.

-----
For Wednesday, May 8, I am planning to have inputs for PC for the following:

	Memory Expansion Board, to go to Rev A;

	DS III, to go to Rev 2;

	MultiSync, to go to the next production Rev.

We have film and Fab for the DSPCOMM Board (Rev 1). I have done the address
GAL for it to make sure there will not be any unpleasant surprises.

Panorama DSK Board
------------------
I have ECNed the parts list to remove the two 27C512s we are not using.
There was no Slapstic on the parts list to remove. I probably forgot
to put Slapstic on the board when I did the programmed part numbers.


DSPCOMM 
-------
Boards have been ordered.
 

DS III
------
I gave Leon inputs for the DS III Rev 2 Board. He made the changes, I checked
and approved them and we ordered 50 boards due on 5/28/91.

I have marked the DS III schematic with the parts that will be left off for
Steel Talons so we can get a releasable parts list.


Memory Expansion Board
----------------------
Ready for film & fab, Rev A;


MultiSync
---------
 After an extensive investigation Mary Burnias has discovered:

    1. TI, which told us last year they were discontinuing 64K4 DRAMs, gave 
       the masks to Hyundai, which is the last and only company in the world
       making them.
    2. There are at least 125K in inventory around the world.
    3. They are still about $3.
    4. Everybody makes 256Kx4 DRAMs.
    5. They are about $6.

Due to cost, the lack of time to make extensive mods to the board, and my
confidence in Mary's ability to get the parts, we are staying with the 
64Kx4 DRAMs.

After Joe finishes the mods, I will mark up the schematics with what is
and isn't loaded for Steel Talons.



Motor and Fan Amp
-------------------
I have given Bonnie another board. (She now has two.)

									2 of 2
Panorama
--------
The Side Displays do not receive +12V and -5V. While the DUART circuit does
not need these voltages to receive, it does need them to transmit.

During the game, the Side Displays only receive.

However, because the Side Displays cannot transmit, the DUART cannot be 
tested.


Steel Talons
------------
I have given the Eds two DS II Graphics RAM boards.

I will convert their Self-Test to do the DS III board. 

Logg complained that the audio self-test stopped working after he had the
SCOM Interrupt mods made.

The problem turned out to be that Brad changed the SA III Self-Test codes.

Logg complained that my Self-Test did not work properly when called from the
problem, athough it ran ok when started from Reset.

The problem turned out to be that they were using the wrong program call to
enter Self-Test.


Jed
_____________________________________________________________________________
{ To Ed Logg }

Your mail message on audio self-test is completely incomprehensible to me.

What is S_STAT?

What is S_YTST?

What is 'Clear to Send'? Is it related to the 'FF' that I was supposed to 
wait for in Stun Runner?  

I thought you were going to have Brad change it back to the version that
worked?

I am trying to make sure you have PC Boards for producing your game and I
don't have time for this audio self-test garbage. 

The information I received from Brad when I did Stun Runner Self-Test
was both inadequate and wrong. I had to go through the RPM source code
to find out what I needed to know to run audio self-test. I will not
do it again.

Therefore, my audio self-test screen will call your code. You write it.

DSPCOMM 
-------
Boards have arrived; Karen is stuffing some.


DS III
------
Boards have been ordered and are due 5/29/91.

I have given Karen the parts list and asked her to have parts ready when the
boards arrive.
 
I have also asked her to stuff two Rev 1 boards according to the parts list
to make sure I haven't taken off too many parts. (The Steel Talons boards
will be stuffed for Graphics only.) Also, we will probably need the boards.


MultiSync
---------
We have ordered boards, due 6/6/91.

I will mark up the schematics with what is and isn't loaded for Steel Talons.


Memory Expansion Board
----------------------
Ready for film & fab, Rev A;


Steel Talons
------------
1. It is not clear whether Brad will change the Self-Test codes back to what 
   they were. I received a mail message from Logg on the subject that is 
   completely incomprehensible. If he expects me to change Self-Test he will 
   have to be very clear what it is supposed to change to. He will also have 
   to supply me with an SA IIS board with ROMs so I can test the code.

   The alternative is to have my Self-Test call a vector to his code similar 
   to how we handle Operator Screen. Then he can write Audio Self-Test.

2. The cabinet's thermal design is very poor, the temperature rise is too 
   high, and the reliability of the hardware will suffer accordingly.
   Even with a fan the PCB ambient temperature rise is 6 deg C. (12 without
   the fan).

									2 of 2

3. I have been ordered to fix a problem with the field test unit that 
   reportedly causes it to reset. Glenn found that one of the ADSP II boards
   had a 32Kx8 RAM stuffed instead of an 8Kx8 RAM. (This was a production
   board.) I have heard that:
   	1. The problem is fixed;
	2. The problem is not fixed.

   The game in question uses the old wire-wrap DSP Link boards and runs old
   software known to have bugs. Logg has refused to update the software to
   use the DSP Link PC Boards or, in fact, to provide any software support 
   whatsoever. It seems there is no source code for this software and 
   therefore no way to have a development system trace the code.

4. The Rumper Thumper produced an impulse SPL of 120 dBa at ear level, which 
   is likely to cause permanent hearing damage to individuals playing it.

   They have added a rubber thing to the solenoid that has reduced the SPL to
   108-110 dBa. It can be argued that this is also too high. Even assuming it 
   gets documented properly, the variation in SPL due to production assembly
   methods and tolerances is unknown.


Road Riot
---------
Its Rumper Thumper produced an impulse SPL of 112 dBa at ear level, which 
I believe is unsafe.

DSPCOMM 
-------
The board seems to work; I have given four (with documentation) to the Eds 
with Race Drivin' Helpers. The DSP Link section is identical to the DSPLINK
Board so they have not had to change any Link software. They have Rev 1 boards
#2, 3, 4, and 5. They still have some DSPLINK Boards. 

They have returned one DSPLINK Board saying it doesn't receive properly. 
It passes Self-Test so the only thing I can do is to write a more extensive 
Self-Test which I will do if I have time. The problem could, of course, be 
elsewhere in their system. The problem could even be in their software.

I recommend the Helper code be changed so it will be unique to Steel Talons.

This is the system I propose to keep track of Helpers:
	Race Drivin'/Panorama/Street Driver:	Version 1.X  (1.3)
	Road Riot:				Version 2.X  (2.0)
	Steel Talons:				Version 3.X


DS III
------
Rev 2 boards have arrived. Karen had Emmette stuff six for me. They all work. 

I have given four (with documentation) to the Eds. They have Rev 2 boards #2, 
3, 4, and 5. 


Road Riot
---------
Out of the first batch of 470 parts there were 437 good ones and 33 bad ones.
for a failure rate of 7.5% . Eight parts were originally classified 'bad' 
because the RBIT did not verify. I checked these parts manually and verified
that the RBIT was working even if it did not verify.

I don't know when this batch of parts was bought, or if they are TMS parts, 
but they all (the 470) seem to have the TI logo on them. 

Out of the second batch (450 parts) so far Tram has had 240 good parts and 6
bad parts for a failure rate of 2.4%
 
Tram has noticed that when the parts come in the plastic tubes they have a
high failure rate (about 8%). When they come in the blue carriers they have
a much lower failure rate (about 2%). However, this also correlates to the
part's label. Lately, the ones that come in the blue carriers have the correct
silkscreen label; the ones that come in the tubes are incorrectly labeled
(they have TI's logo on them and the other information is incorrectly placed.)

BMX
---
I gave Bonnie new Self-Test ROMs that control the Driver Motor Amp at full
force. I have also fixed the tachometer.

I gave her two more Motor and Fan Amp Boards. She now has Rev 1 boards #2, 3, 
4, and 5.


Steel Talons
------------
Stevie showed me a piece of cardboard to represent how she is going to mount 
the Rump/Thump Board. I have not received a copy of the harness diagram
because it is not ready.  

They have designed the cabinet in such a way as to make it impossible to
effectively install a fan.

I have spent considerable time trying to fix Rev 1 boards for Bonnie. Part of
the time has been in adding Self-Test functions to troubleshoot the board.


Motor and Fan Amp Board
------------------------
I am making the changes as time permits. We need to do more work on the 
filter.


Simulators
----------
Jim Flack consulted with me about the fuse problem in the unit in Wyoming.
It turned out that the main fuse was 7A (the Race Drivin' value) instead of 
10A for Panorama. They apparently replaced it with an 8A fuse from the town's 
Radio Shack.

Since there was originally some question about the unit being susceptible
to line spikes due to lighting hits, I told him they could probably
use a PC type A/C line protector, also available at Radio Shack. 

I told Jim that the Steel Talons hardware (with the high spped Link) could
link together several 3-Monitor units with Steel Talons as a simulator
concept.

I spent time with Matt helping him designing the AT interface for the 
DSPLINK Board and answering his questions as he learned to use OrCad.

1. Spent time trying to find out why the MultiSync Boards for Steel Talons
   are not being done.

   Answer: Karen doesn't have the parts. She either can't get them from
   	   Manufacturing or she is just taking her time about it. (I gave
	   Emmette the boards last Wednesday.)

2. Spent time generating a response to Rob Bryant's questions about Steel 
   Talon prototype boards. Also, in response to Rob's questions about
   TI having problems getting working ASIC65s, arranged for a conference
   call on Thursday with their engineer.

3. Gave Leon the final inputs to take:
	 DS III from Rev 2 to Rev A;
	 DSPCOM from Rev 1 to Rev A.

4. Spent time with Glenn discussing:
	a. Logg's decision to use MultiSync Coin Cointer Outputs for Rump 
	   Thump instead of the LC1 and LC2 LED Outputs. It seems that the
	   Rump Thump has inputs that are reverse polarity from the LC1
	   outputs and Logg is apparently unable to figure out how to reverse
	   it in software.

	   This means that the Split pad connecting the Coin Counter Outputs
	   will have to be manually cut in Production. If they had told me
	   of their plans I would have replaced the split pad with a jumper 
	   plug, but I will not make the change now, 4 days before they want
	   the board released.

	   Glenn has found out that the Coin Counter Outputs on the MultiSync
	   Board don't go to the connector pins as shown on the schematic;
	   they are reversed. Score another one for Gary Popkin. I have asked
	   Leon to correct the schematic.

	b. Downend sent Glenn a memo (thru Logg) asking him to have a 
	   programmed-part series assigned to Steel Talons in order to
	   assign numbers for the Audio Board. Logg apparently forget that
	   I had a series number assigned several months ago and have assigned
	   part numbers for the MultiSync, DS III, and DSPCOM Boards.

	   I worked with Glenn in assigning programmed part numbers for the 
	   audio board.

	c. The decision to have one Rump Thump board supply Regulated +15V
	   to both games is stupid. If that side goes down, the other side 
	   will go down as well. And it will make it more difficult to fix; 
	   everything else is independent so people won't be looking for 
	   something that isn't.

	d. I have still not received a harness diagram.

5. Last night I spent about two hours working on Motor and Fan Amp Rev 2 for
   BMX.

==============================================================================
Tuesday
-------

1. I received the first MultiSync Rev B stuffed for Steel Talons. 

   I changed Self-Test to use the SLOOP (GAL6001 that McCarthy gave me); it 
   didn't work. Pat gave me another one to try; it didn't work either.

2. Joe and Leon showed me the changes they made on DSPCOM and DS III. I 
   approved and they will go ahead with the documentation. I expect to
   release both boards on or before Monday.

3. Rob Bryant came over to discuss parts lists, GALs, and ASIC65s. I told him
   about the change in the DS III parts list. 

   He is willing to wait until Monday for the released parts lists.

   I promised to release the GALs on the DS III and DSPCOM boards by the end
   of next week. It is necessary to release them so they will get on MANMAN
   so he can contract them out to be made. Otherwise I will have to burn them 
   myself.

   While he was here I salvaged eight ASIC65s for Road Riot. They were the
   parts with RBIT verify errors. I verified that the program was secure.

   	Road Riot Parts Received     Good	     Bad
	------------------------     ----	  ----------
		  920		      880	  40  (4.35%)

4. The ROM Address GAL on the DS III Board is configured so ROMs can be 
   27C512s or 27C010s. Currently, the absence of a jumper selects 27C512s;
   27C010s requires a jumper plug in header G0. Since Ed intends to use
   27C010s I am changing the GAL program so that the absence of a jumper
   plug selects 27C010s. 27C512s will be selected by a plug jumper in G0.

   I have changed the GAL program and will ask Glenn to make sure everyone is 
   properly changed.

5. I went over with Glenn the requirements for generating the AROMREL for
   Steel Talons.

6. I fixed another Memory Epansion Board for BMX. It had a bad trace that I
   repaired with a jumper. Out of ten prototype boards:
   	I have 1 working board;
	Bonnie has 7 working boards;
	One is blank;
	One has fallen and can't get up.

7. Last night I spent about 1.5 hours working on Motor and Fan Amp Rev 2 for
   BMX.
==============================================================================

Wednesday
---------

1. Tam programmed more parts for Road Riot. Out of 279 parts there were 36
   bad ones (12.9% failure). 

   	Road Riot Parts Received     Good	     Bad
	------------------------     ----	  ----------
		  920		      880	  40  (4.35%)
		 1199		     1123	  76  (6.34%)


2. We are not equipped to test VRAMs. I wasted a bunch of time trying to fix
   what Erik thought was the only MultiSync Board with VRAM sockets.

   I installed the VRAMs in a very old rev Main Board which promptly and
   totally stopped working. Erik found a MultiSync Board with VRAM sockets
   in a Compact game and installed the new VRAMs. 

   They pass Self-Test and work in the game. Erik and I checked specifically
   to may sure they do not exhibit the NEC problem.

   It would have been nice to have received a data sheet with the VRAMs.

3. Meeting to discuss future hardware: I think the time for decisive action 
   has passed and, instead, we should engage in senseless bickering.

4. I still don't have a working SLOOP from McCarthy.

5. Last night I spent about 2 hours on the PCLINK that I am helping Matt with.
   Results: The OrCad program to print schematics does not work if it is 
   printed to a file and then copied to the printer. It only works if it
   printed to the printer. 

   The Lab HP IIP Printer does not work properly. It cannot print a B size 
   drawing from OrCad. My HP IIP at home does it just fine.

============================================================================

Thursday
--------

1. I wrote this for Ed Logg.
==========================================================================
The following is the ROM Release procedure that I suggest be used for
Steel Talons. It is the procedure used for Panorama. 

Requirements:
   1. There should be a single file (AROMRELx.DOC) that contains all the 
      information needed to produce the latest Masters to build a game.
      This file is created and maintained by the Project Team.

   2. This file should not contain unnecessary information such as ROMs that
      have been superseded.

Reason:
      Previously, the parts lists maintained by the PC Group contained
all the latest programmed part numbers. When a part was raised another
Rev level the parts list was ECNed.

      With Component Engineering's new system this is no longer the case.
I believe this is related to the new numbering system. Previously the Rev 
level was built into the part number so that 136087-1001 was a Rev A part,
136087-2001 was a Rev B part, and so on. With the new system the part is
labeled with the Rev level: "136087-1001 Rev A", "136087-1001 Rev B", and
so on. The parts list is not changed as the Rev level is changed. The parts
list would continue to call out "136087-1001".

     Therefore, there must be another document that tells Manufacturing what
ROMs (and other programmed parts) to put into the game.

     Said document is the dreaded AROMRELx.DOC  .
 
     When you first release Rev A parts, the information goes in AROMREL.DOC .

Next is where my procedure might be different from the one specified by
Components Engineering:

    When you release more Rev A parts or change the Rev level of existing
parts you will create a new AROMRELx.DOC such as AROMREL2.DOC, AROMREL3.DOC,
and so on.
									5 of 6

   The latest AROMRELx.DOC will contain all the programmed parts necessary
to build the game. It will not contain parts that have been superseded.

For Steel Talons the AROMRELx.DOC files should be located in
[Logg.Aces.Release]  .

Rev A parts should be in [Logg.Aces.Release.ROMREVA] .
Rev B parts should be in [Logg.Aces.Release.ROMREVB] .

Note that a game can (and usually does) have programmed parts at several 
different Rev levels.

When you are planning to release parts try to notify Rick Owens ahead of
time, preferably a few days. To release ROMs give him a copy of the new
AROMRELx.DOC along with the masters of the parts you are releasing.

Do not give him masters of parts that have already been released.
==========================================================================
Logg acknowledged receipt of this message and corrected my mistake.
It is [Logg.Ace.Release] no plural.

2. Rick Meyette was able to get Steel Talons to pass FCC by adding 100 pF
caps to the serial lines. We played the game and it linked just fine; even so,
as soon as I get a chance I will look at the signals with a 'scope. The
advantage of the Party Line system is that all signals (including the clock)
travel the same path. 

   There are already 100 Ohm resistors in series with the serial connector; 
adding 200 pF (100 pF on each board) produces a circuit with a time constant 
of t = RxC = 100x200x10E-12 = 20 ns. There should be no problem with this.

3. Received more DSPCOM Boards from Karen. I will bring them up and send them
   on their way.

4. Tom Dempsey the TI Rep was supposed to set up a conference call today
   with a TI engineer. He didn't, so I called him.

5. Received first working SLOOP from McCarthy. MultiSync Rev B works. I have
   given one to Logg to try out in a game. The SLOOP has been replaced with
   a wired-jumper header for this test because Steel Talons' software is not 
   yet set up for a SLOOP.

6. I sent one of the MultiSync Boards back to Karen for re-grooving because
   it was missing parts.

7. Tam programmed more parts for Road Riot. Out of 93 parts there were 11
   bad ones (11.8% failure). 

   	Total Road Riot Parts Received     Good	     Bad
	------------------------------     ----	  ----------
		 1292			  1205	  87  (6.73%)

Out of the last 47 bad parts, 20 were received non-blank; i.e. filled
with zeros. Tom Dempsey suspects that these were parts that had been
subjected to the Data Retention Test where they program the part to be
all zeros, put it in an oven overnight, and then check if any bits
changed back to '1'.

									6 of 6
==============================================================================

Friday
------

1. Karen reclaimed the DSPCOM Boards and gave them to Glenn. Glenn didn't
   know what to do with them and brought them back to me. It took more time
   to deal with this situation than it would have taken me to bring up
   the boards myself.

2. I have set up the Compact boardset with the Korean VRAMs on 
   'VRAM LOOP TEST' and will have it continuously run VRAM Verify tests 
   over the weekend.

3. Spoke to Tom Dempsey (local TI Rep) and Boyd Reed (somebody in Houston,
   but not an engineer). I told them:
     a. The last batch had a 12% failure rate, half of which were parts
	received non-blank. 

	Boyd stated catagorically that there was no way they could have 
	made a mistake and shipped us parts used for the data retention test.

     b. I told him that the parts that had the wrong silkscreen were
	much more likely to fail than the ones with the correct silkscreen.
	These parts with the wrong silkscreen were also much more likely
	to come in the tubes rather than the Blue Bricks.
 
	Boyd said there was nothing wrong with the tubes.

     c. I told Boyd that if they were using 3M sockets for the burn-in test
        they sould get rid of them and change to Yamaichi sockets because the
	3M burn-in sockets are no good.

	Boyd didn't know what sockets they were using.

     d. I told Boyd that they should replace the EPROM in the part with 
        Flash EPROM.

They are supposed to arrange a conference call on Monday with an engineer.

4. Rick Meyette had a problem with a high frequency emission on the MultiSync 
   Board. I looked at it and realized that he was using an old converted Stun 
   Runner Board with the wrong oscillator module in the video section.

   I reclaimed the MultiSync Rev B from the Eds and gave it to Meyette. I
   also gave him another Rev B board. He has MultiSync Rev B #1 and #2.

   Steel Talons has passed FCC.

5. I never received a harness diagram for Steel Talons. 

6. Motor and Fan Amp Board: I am working on Rev 2 in my copious spare time. 
   We need to do more work on the filter.

Re: Status Report
Dt: 21 June 1991


Monday
------

1. The Compact Driver with the Korean VRAMs ran 2502 VRAM memory tests over 
   the weekend and had no errors. (The game had been closed up for the test.)
   I showed Rick Owens how to run the test and he will test the VRAMs in a 
   board in the oven.

2. I talked to Thom Dempsey, Boyd Reed, and Ken Kelly (product engineer) from
   TI in a conference call.

   According the Ken Kelly:

   	a. The data retention tests in Houston have been ok, they shipped
	   parts to us today.

	b. The parts we received that were filled with zeros may have been
	   the result of operator error; the operator may have inadvertantly 
	   selected an EPROM test which is fatal since OTPs cannot be erased.

   I took the opportunity to recommend to them that if any of their test
   fixtures use 3M sockets they get rid of them and use Yamaichi sockets.

   I also repeated my suggestion that they put Flash EPROM in the P15.
   They agreed it was a good idea once they get their Flash EPROMs to work!

3. There was considerable excitement when Rick Meyette did the ESD test and
   just about everything he touched reset the game. It looked like I would
   have to delay the release of my PC Boards. Rick came through, however,
   and announced the problem seemed to be in the Hitron Power Supplies.

   Therefore I have released for Steel Talons:
   	MultiSync
	DS III
	DSPCOM

   I immediately made copies of the parts lists and placed them on Rob 
   Bryant's desk.

4. We have received 16 Rev A Memory Expansion Boards for BMX. This is the
   first PCB I have seen that didn't have a square pad for pin 1 of each part.
   (The Rev 1 boards did have square pads for pin 1.) 

   The plots I received show square pads. Leon thinks the vendor screwed up
   when he made the film. The vendor logo is 'SK'.

   I will tell Melanie.

5. I finally got a Steel Talons Harness Diagram from Stevie.

									2 of 5
6. I spent about 5 hours over the weekend on the Motor and Fan Amp.
   This is what I have done so far:

   	1. Change spacing on the Fuse Holders from 1.25" to 1.35".
	   (The fuses did not fit in 1.25".)

	2. Change the Hole for the Power Connectors from 0.062 to 0.073.
	   (0.062 was too small.)

	3. Change the hole for the Power Transformer from 0.062 to 0.052.
	   (The board cannot use more than 8 different sizes. In order
	    to use 0.073 for the connectors I had to get rid of one drill
	    size. I had Erik drill a plate with 0.052 holes and the 
	    transformer fit ok.)

	4. Change the pinout for the Power Transformer.
	   (I guessed wrong the first time.)

	5. Change the Outline for the Interface Connector.

	6. Fix the Outline and pad numbers for the LEDs.

	7. Add 1000pF caps to the SEL1 and SEL2 inputs and have both signals
	   go through 74LS14s. Move the 74LS14 to be closer to the Interface 
	   Connector. [ Section 7 is the part I did over the last weekend.]

   I think the board will have to be bigger if we add the Filter 
   capacitors to it. We are currently 8.0" x 10.0" .

=============================================================================
Tuesday
-------

1. I got some information from Thom Dempsey of TI on the 34020 and 1M VRAM:
   So far it is available only in PGA (145 pin). The price should
   come down once it comes out in PQFP.

    TMS34020GBL-32			      1K        5K       10K

				1992	    $8.75     $8.65   

   He also gave me some samples of their 4M EPROM (512Kx8). It is big.

									3 of 5

2. I have made a change to the GAL on the DS III that selects the Graphics
   ROMs. The new part will select 27C010 ROMs with no jumper plug at G0.
   When a jumper plug is present at G0 the ROMs will be selected as 27C512s.

   Self-Test is able to read the state of G0 and report checksums appropriate
   to the type of ROM selected. This feature is standard for Rev 2 and Rev A
   boards; Rev 1 boards would have to be modified for the Self-Test feature 
   to work.
   
3. Glenn has reported to me that the new Switch Lamp didn't work because
   for +5V, Stevie used the +5V Reference for the 12 Bit A/D, which was not
   designed to drive an incandescent lamp.

4. I am planning on releasing GALs for Steel Talons this week.
   The GALs are on:
   		    DS III Board (2 GAL20V8-15 and 1 GAL16V8-15) 
		    DSPCOM Board (2 GAL16V8-15)

5. We received a shipment of real Production ASIC65s.
   Tam brought over 528. So far the results are:

   	175 total	172 good	3 bad (1.71%)

6. Spent some time with Moncrief figuring out the Helper for Steel Talons.

=============================================================================
Wednesday
---------

1. Spent some time with Moncrief figuring out the Helper for Steel Talons.

2. Gave Meyette the parts list for the Motor and Fan Amp Board and discussed
   the board's power transformer (there are two sources, both UL recognized).

   The fuse clips are not U.L.listed; Rick has found a molded fuse block with
   PC terminals that is listed. I will have to redo the fuse blocks again 
   which means ripping out most of the 120VAC traces and doing it over 
   (again). Also, the fuse blocks call out a 0.06 diameter hole, which I do 
   not have. The board can only have eight different drill sizes and I 
   already have eight. The closest to 0.06 is either 0.052 or 0.073. Rick 
   will get me some samples to try out.

3. Tam programmed the last of the current batch. The failure rate for these
   production parts was much improved. There were 12 failures out of 528 parts
   which is 2.3% . Also. I expect I will be able to salvage some when I have 
   time.

4. Am working on Steel Talons Self-Test.

									4 of 5
Thursday
--------
1. I explained to Dennis how to do the checksums for the ASIC65.

2. I worked most of the time getting Steel Talons Self-Test to the point
   that I could release a new version. The reasons are made clear in the memo 
   I sent to Logg.
==============================================================================
From:	KIM::MARGOLIN     20-JUN-1991 18:54:39.21
To:	LOGG,MCNAMARA,MONCRIEF,DOWNEND
CC:	MARGOLIN
Subj:	GALs

I have changed the operation of the GAL on the DS III Board at location 1A/B.

This GAL is used in selecting the Graphics ROMs; these ROMs can be either
27C512s or 27C010s depending on whether there is a pin header in G0.

	Old was: No Header = 27C512, Header = 27C010

I have changed it to:

	No Header = 27C010, Header = 27C512

On DS III boards starting with Rev 2, the 68010 can read the state of
Pin Header G0. Self-Test starting with Version 2.4 uses this so it can 
correctly compute checksums.

I would like to have all DS III Boards to have the new GAL. It is a 16V8-25
and the file is [Margolin.GALs.Release]DS3_ROM.JED. The old part has a 
checksum of 4177; the new part has a checksum of 4178.

At the same time, the games should get the latest Self-Test which is
[Margolin.Aces]STAL2_4.VLDA [Note that Self-Test is not yet finished.]


(When I release the GALs I will ask to have the files moved to 
[Logg.Ace.Release.ROMREVA].)


DS III Rev 1 boards can be modified to have this feature:

	1. On bottom of board, Cut the trace going to 6P pin 19;
	2. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 19 to 5J pin 1; 
	3. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 11 to pin header G0; 
	4. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 9 to 5D pin 6.

1. Reviewed Matt's PCLINK documentation package. I think this board will be
   very useful.

2. Got GAL documentation ready to release. Logg et. al. had disappeared

Monday
------
1. I have released the GALs for Steel Talons. This is for DS III and DSPCOM. 
   The GAL6001 on the MultiSync Board is McCarthy's.

2. I gave Karen 14 Memory Expansion Boards and asked her to have them done
   by Monday July 1. The boards are mostly sockets.

3. I spent about 4 hours over the weekend on the Motor and Fan Amp.
   I am almost done with Rev 2. I am working on the parts list.


Tuesday
-------
1. Spent time working on the Motor and Fan Amp Board. Have made final plots.
   I tried plotting the Drill Template directly to ID's Houston Instruments
   Plotter. The drill symbols came out wrong on it, too. The only correct
   Drill Templates have been made on the HP IIP. There is currently no
   way to produce a correct Drill Template in a form that can be imported
   into AutoCad.


Wednesday
---------
1. Made the GAL address decoder for the PCLINK Board.

2. Meeting: New Safety laws.

3. Spent time with Logg et. al. figuring out boards for Steel Talons.

4. Spent time with Erik and Rick evaluating the filter for the Motor and
   Fan Amp Board. Threw out final plots after Rick changed the filter.

5. Worked with Matt in starting to bring up the PCLINK Board.

Thursday
---------
1. Worked with Matt in bringing up the PCLINK Board.

2. Got Motor and Fan Amp working for Meyette. This one has the transformer
   from Signal. 

3. Added the Test for Bonnie: It does the random life testing of both the
   Motor and the Fan together.

4. Called OrCad and explained the problem: The only way to get a drill 
   template with the Drill Symbols is to Print it on the Printer. Anything
   else creates a template with holes marked by circles of the appropriate
   size and no drill symbols. Therefore there is no way to get the real Drill
   Template into AutoCad or even plotted on a real plotter.

   The Orcad guy agreed.

5. Worked on Self-Test for Steel Talons.

 
Friday
------
1. Worked with Matt in bringing up the PCLINK Board.

2. Gave Bonnie the new Self-Test that fixes the tachometer and includes a
   life test for motor and fan together.

3. Worked on Steel Talons Self-Test.

Steel Talons
------------
1. I have finished two of the new Self-Test screens for the DSPCOM Board. I
   have at least two more to do plus the Auto Self_test section. 

   Glenn gave Manufacturing ROMs before I could give him the new screens. I
   do not consider the version they got to be very useable.

2a. Ed Log wanted some cost figures on the DS III, which I gave him. I am 
    surprised he didn't already have them.

 b. Ed Rotberg wanted a memory map so he could figure out how to
    make the 6001/Slapstic work on addresses outside the the ROM
    address. This means that the 6001 will be receptive to addresses
    outside of the ROM 7 space. The first Slapstics were like that.
    No one ever got them to work in the Shell mode. The only ones
    to be made to work in that mode were the later Slapstics that 
    responded to addresses within the ROM selected space.

    I know for a fact that over the years I have deluged the Steel
    Talons team with documentation and memory maps.

1. I gave Bonnie the additional test she asked for.

2. I received the Rev A Memory Expansion Boards from Karen. I made the
   GALs and got eleven boards to work. Three of the boards have a 
   visibly defective trace. I will ask Leon to look at the artwork.


PCLINK

Matt wrote a routine that will allow us to download program code through the
interface (it was my idea). 

The PCLINK Board uses the same Boot ROM as the Steel Talons DSPCOM Board. 
This has been integrated with Peter's code; however, they are not in the 
Steel Talons games now being built.

I have added two 12 Bit DACs to the board. I will add a 12 Bit A/D if
there is room. 

The A/D I have chosen (AD7870):
	a. has a single input;
	b. has a built-in sample and Hold;
	c. does a conversion in about 10 us.
	d. connects to the 2101's serial port.
	e. costs $18 in 100s.

I didn't ask what it would be in 1000s. The AD7582 we are using has a four
input Multiplexer and costs $16.25 but takes 100 us for a conversion which is
only 10KHz.

Julie says that Margot is supposed to come back to work next week.

I am still working on the Self-Test screens. There are three major areas left:

	1. How to checksum the DSPCOM Boot ROM since there is no direct access
	   to it. My solution is to checksum each Boot Page separately after
	   it is booted. (Unfortunately, Peter did not leave any space in his
	   boot page. I think I can do it anyway.) The Program Checksum will
	   not be the same as the EPROM Checksum but it will serve to 
	   determine if the EPROM was any good.

	2. A test of the DSPLINK where the first unit sends data, the second 
	   unit echos it, and the first unit receives it and compares it to 
	   what it sent. This will establish the reliability of the link and
	   allow us to determine how long the link cable can be.
	   
	3. Put the appropriate tests in the Automatic part of Self-Test.

The games in the Common Area get plugged into one of two electrical circuits.

With Panorama plugged into one circuit and the Slugfest Pinball game plugged
into the other circuit, John Moore and I measured approximately 40VAC 
between exposed metal on the respective games. We measured it because John 
reported getting a mild electrical shock when he happened to touch both games
simultaneously. (The games are next to each other.) 

The problem turned out to be that the Ground Pin on the Extension Plugstrip
had been removed. I have removed the Plugstrip from service so you may deal 
with it as you see fit.

I am still working on the Self-Test screens. I have worked out a way to
checksum most of the Boot ROM program.

There are two major areas left:

	1. Put the appropriate tests in the Automatic part of Self-Test.

	2. A test of the DSPLINK where the first unit sends data, the second 
	   unit echos it, and the first unit receives it and compares it to 
	   what it sent. This will establish the reliability of the link and
	   allow us to determine how long the link cable can be.
	   

Dennis has delivered an EPROM containing the new ASIC65 program and approved 
the part made from it. I have shown Glenn how to use the programmer; now he
can make as many parts as they need.

The original window parts are approaching the end of their lifetimes. I have 
four that I am still able to program. (The Eds have two of them.) The Atari 
part number for the window parts is 137665-0020 . We now have an additional
six window parts.

Steel Talons Self-Test
----------------------
1. Matt has helped me find the bug in the DSPCOM program where the unit would
   not Receive until it had first sent something. I have put my latest 2105
   code with Peter's latest 2105 code and created and checksummed a new Boot 
   ROM Version 1.9/5.3 (Self-Test 1.9/Peter's code 5.3). I have given the 
   files to Peter for confirmation.
 
2. There is one major Self-Test area left:

      A test of the DSPLINK where the first unit sends data, the second unit
      echos it, and the first unit receives it and compares it to what it 
      sent. This will establish the reliability of the link and allow us to 
      evaluate link cables and determine how long the link cable can be.

3. I spent time with Andrea showing her the new parts of Self-Test.
   I have also marked up the MultiSync schematic for the manual.
   I received the preview copy of the manual on Friday, and reviewed and 
   returned it the same day. It is horrible. Not only does it contain 
   eggregious errors that Andrea would have caught if she had looked at the 
   game that is right outside her office door, it contains 'boiler plate' from
   other hardware.

4. At this point, the MultiSync board has a TimeKeeper but Logg does not
   seem interested in using it.

5. I spent time with Logg and McCarthy discussing their plans for the SLOOP.
   (I gave them more memory map information.) Logg's mode will respond to all 
   addresses not in ROM7. This is really asking for trouble. And will probably
   make it impossible to use the DS III Sound when they run out of SCUMs.

   I did the timing analysis and decided that ROM 7 could handle an extra 35ns
   delay so Pat can do his fancy SLOOP thing.

6. The first credible program release date to appear on the schedule was 
   8/23/91.

   This was then changed to 8/19/91. 

   In a mail message dated 7/24/91 Logg said he wanted it two and a half 
   weeks early, before 7/31/91. 

   This does not give me time to do the things I had planned. 

   I have given Logg the most current Self-Test. I have not tested it as 
   completely as I would like.

   As of today I do not have a SLOOP; and therefore cannot test the code that
   uses said device.

couldn't find where some signals came from. What is going on here?

Jed;

	I seem to have a hardware problem with the 8 bit ADC.  I have an 
intermitent problem with the pot reading moving without any change in the pot.
I have experienced this with the PCB on Rotberg's bench and I have recieved
reports of it occuring on field test and on my bench.

	I have a scope hooked up to the pot output and to the input on the ADC.
The value on the ADC input will change when the pot value doesn't.  The ADC will
slowly move until it snaps back to the correct reading.

	Could you give us some help here?

						Thanks

Subj:	A/D Problem

Although I have not been able to duplicate the problem I believe it is due
to the unused A/D inputs floating.

In this regard, Input 6 may be the worst because, having been used only 
internaly to read the output of the Strain Gage Brake Amplifier, it has no 
bypass capacitors whose leakage can keep the A/D's input reasonably biased.
It does, however, have a very nice resistor to ground which, unfortunately, 
was not loaded.

Plan A: Load R193 (1K, on Sheet 16)

Plan B: Load R193 (1K, on Sheet 16);
	Replace C5, C6, C7, C8, and C14 with 100K 1/8W Resistors (110027-104)


I have added R193 to Rotberg's board so we can get a headstart in deciding
which solution to use.

We are under severe time constraints because Manufacturing is scheduled to
start building the boards this week.

If we choose Plan B we will need Meyette's blessing because these capacitors
may affect FCC.

Also: I need a SLOOP to verify Self-Test (and the SLOOP).

Also: I have done the Board Test Procedure for Manufacturing. Copies are 
available upon request.

Subject: Preferred Instructions List			Date: August 8, 1991
=============================================================================
Purpose: The Preferred Instructions List (PIL) is a tool to help Software
Engineers to choose common Microprocessor Instructions. By standardizing the 
Instructions used in our products Manufacturing will be able to plan, 
purchase, and stock these microprocessors with these common instructions more 
economically. The PIL could result in fewer vendors, fewer purchase orders,
fewer instructions to keep in stock, and less obsolete inventory. All of these
savings can help to reduce the factory overhead costs.

PIL Usage: When deciding which instruction to use, the Software Engineer is
strongly encouraged to use an instruction that is on the PIL. Howvever, if
a non-PIL instruction has significant economic or functional advantages, it 
may be used. If you choose a non-PIL instruction, be prepared to justify your
choice to your supervisor.

History: Various members of Engineering and Manufacturing have generated the
PIL. The intent was to provide a single preferred instruction out of a group 
of similar instructions. Jeff Bell has put this list into the computer. Jeff
will send out a mail message in the next couple of days that will tell you
how to access the PIL file (which gets updated daily). The instructions 
listing on the AIL (Approved Instruction List) also identify instructions
on the PIL with a "PREFERRED INSTRUCTION" flag.

Additions to/ Removals from the PIL:
The Electrical Design Supervisor (Pat McCarthy) will be responsible for 
maintaining the electrical portion of the PIL. Requests for additions to the
electrical portion of the PIL should be forwarded to him. He will review the
PIL quarterly and decide if any instructions should be removed.

The Design Services Director (Pete Takaichi) will be responsible for 
maintaining the hardware and wiring portions of the PIL. Requests for 
additions to these portions of the PIL should be forwarded to him. He will 
review the PIL quarterly and decide if any instructions should be removed.

Tools for PIL: Pat McCarthy, Pete Takaichi, and Jeff Bell are working on a
method whereby you will be able to get a listing of your program that flags
preferred and non-preferred instructions. These methods will be published
as they are available.

Feel free to contact John Ray if you have any questions or suggestions for
making the PIL more useful.

Re: ADSP-2101
Dt: 16 August 1991


   On Friday, August 16, 1991, Dan Ashe of Analog Devices called to report 
that the selection critera used to select 2101s for our use have been changed 
so that the parts will no longer be selected to work when the Bus Request 
input is used with Memory Wait States other than '0'. 

   I reminded Dan that I had been told that the part was to have been fixed
by the end of the summer, and, by golly, here it was, the end of the summer.

   He said he didn't know anything about it but would have someone call me.
(Damon Chu has left so I would be called by someone else.)

   No one has called me yet.

   Dan Ashe promised to fax me the new selection list. When I received it I
compared it to the bug list we already had. 

Bug #1: We already knew about the '0' Wait State Requirement and I redesigned 
        it for '0' wait states.

Bug #2: Bug #2 is completely NEW. We have NEVER seen it before. And I have
        NO way of knowing if it affects us:

Bug #1 applies to all temperature grades of the ADSP-2101-50 and the extended
temperature range of the ADSP-2101-40. We do not use the extended temperature
range 2101 so our exposure is to the ADSP-2101-50.

We are getting the selected parts AD90461-7 so that the Bus Request works
properly at an operating temperature of 85 degrees C and an operating voltage
greater than 4.5V. 

Bug #2 applies to all 2101 material. I would guess it includes 2105s.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug #2. "When using multifunction instructions that are type 1 with external
memory, the following sequence causes anomalous operation:

   When a type 1 instruction that contains an internal instruction fetch,
   an external data memory fetch, and an internal program memory data read is
   immediately followed with a type 1 instruction with both data fetched 
   external, the latter instruction operates incorrectly. A simple work round 
   is to place the instructions in the opposite order."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									2 of 2

According to the manual, a type 1 instruction is an ALU/MAC instruction that
allows two registers to be loaded from different memories in the same cycle.

Example:	AX0 = DM(I0,M0), AY0 = PM(I4,M4);

In the 2101 the external program and data memory share the same bus. 
Therefore, there are only two ways to have a type 1 instruction operate
in one cycle:

	a. Instruction fetch from internal program ram,
	   external data memory fetch,
           internal program program memory data.

	b. Instruction fetch from internal program ram,
	   internal data memory fetch,
           external program program memory data.

The type 1 instruction where both data fetches are external cause the 2101
to fetch them in consecutive cycles since it cannot fetch them simulaneously,
unlike the 2100 which has two separate external data and program buses.

They only mention the problem with type 1 'a' instructions. It may also apply
to Type 1 'b' instructions as well. Also, the bug sheet specifically says 
these are 'read' operations. Does it work ok with 'writes'?
 
Since this applies to all 2101 material, it is probably a logic error, rather
than a bug due to a violation of IC design rules, or an error in processing
the IC. I am appalled by the negligence Analog Devices has shown by their
failure to do even the most rudimentary testing; they apparently prefer to 
have their customers discover and report bugs.
==============================================================================
I have not used any Type 1 instructions on the DSPCOM Board or on the DS III
Board. 

I looked at Peter's code in the 2105 on the DSPCOM board. I did not find any
Type 1 instructions. I think we should ask him to look, too.

I do not have access to the DS III 2101 code. It is urgent that someone
look at it.

Re: Analog Devices, The Plot Thickens
Dt: 21 August 1991
CC: Mary Burnias


I received a call from Margot today. She faxed me a copy of a memo she had
received from Lisa Quetchenbach, the Western Region Business Development
Manager, who replaced Damon Chu.

According to this letter she and someone else (which is the common meaning
of 'we' ) discussed the following with me:
 	
    1. The part Atari has been buying (90461-1) is having yield problems 
       at 125 degrees C.

    2. I participated in a discussion to establish new selection criteria
       to allow them to ship us parts that will continue to meet our needs.

Her memo is a pack of LIES.

1. To my knowledge I have never met or spoken to this Quetchenbach person,
   and certainly not in the past week. I think she was the person whom
   Dan promised would call me, and didn't.

2. When Dan Ashe called me last Friday it was to inform me that ADI had 
   changed the selection criteria for the 2101 and that he would fax me a 
   copy of the new criteria. This change only concerned the operation of the 
   Bus Request line with Memory Wait States that are not zero.

   After I got the fax I noticed that:
  
 	a. The part we have been buying was a 90461-1 not a 90461-7.

	b. The selection criteria I had agreed to already included using
	   Bus Requests only with Zero Wait States.

	c. There was an NEW anomoly, that was not part of the 90461-1
	   specification.  
	
3. Dan never said anything about a yield problem at 125 degrees C. (or any
   other temperature). 

   We buy parts rated for the Commercial temperature range of 0 to 70 
   degrees C. What's with this 125 degrees C. business?

4. He never said there was a yield problem with -1 parts and he wanted to 
   send us -7 parts. He said ADI was changing the selection criteria. Period. 
   He also misstated the change in selection criteria. He did not tell me
   there was a new, major anomoly. He did not ask me if I would approve it.

5. The memo from Ms. Quetchenbach states: " If Atari can accept the new 
   ADSP-2101 special, then we will have no difficulty in meeting Atari's
   next delivery date of August 27."

   The threat is clear: If you want parts, you will use the -7 parts.

6. It is not clear if this problem already exits in the -1 and they just 
   haven't told us.

   It is not clear if this problem exits in the 2105.

   It is not clear how long they have known about it. If they had told me
   about it five months ago I could have used a 12 MHz ADSP-2100A instead
   of the ADSP-2101. (this would have avoided all these problems.)

7. I have checked Peter's code (which runs in a 2105 which may or may not
   have this problem) and he does not use the now forbidden sequence of
   instructions.

8. I have started checking the DS III Graphics code (or what I think is the
   DS III Graphics Code) and I have identified several sections which may
   violate the new criteria. The problem is that for each section I must
   identify:
     1. Is this a type 1 instruction?
     2. Where does the code live? 
     3. Where is the data memory read from?
     4. Where is the program memory data read from?
     5. Is the next instruction also type 1 with both data fetches external?

The problem is when a type 1 instruction contains an internal instruction
fetch, an external data memory read, and an internal program memory data read,
and is immediately followed by a type 1 instruction with both data fetches 
external.

Even if it looks ok to me, it will have to be checked by a programmer. Even
if it looks ok to a programmer we will have to test it with actual -7 parts.

9. If the code does not work with the 90461-7 part, then the code can be
   be rewritten to avoid the forbidden instruction sequence. However:
   	1. The programmer is not here this week;
	2. The new code may run slower;
	3. The new code will have to be thoroughly tested;

   As a result we may not be able to ship games with 90461-7 parts until
   the middle of September.

Steel Talons Update
-------------------

1. I checked the game with the AD90461-7 parts. It was still working and had
   experienced no Resets or Timeouts during the night.

   I came back, explained the situation to Ray Sherman, and he immediately 
   put the -7 part on the AVL.

   We did not receive the parts today as Analog Devices has promised. They
   claim the guy who marks the parts was ill on Friday. (I think they already
   used the Hurricane Bob excuse last week.)


2. Jim Buchanan showed me a board with the following problem:

	Sometimes, after power-on, some of the VRAMs don't work. There
	are lines of pixels missing on the screen, and the simple VRAM
	Test shows two bad VRAMs. An attempt to run the game results in the
	famous 'GSP Timeout Error'. (Even a single 'bad' VRAM will cause the 
	GSP program to crash, generating the GSP Timeout message.)

   Resetting the game does not help. It can only be brought up by power 
   cycling it.

   What makes this game different from other games?

   We are now using Samsung VRAMs that have a slighly different power-up
   requirement than the TI and Micron VRAMs we were using.

   Samsung requires a 200 us reset time while TI and Micron require only 
   100 us. 

   I have checked my timing, and the shortest reset time I have been giving
   it is 350 uS.

   This is what I have done:

        I have made Steel Talons Self-Test ROMs with the GSP Reset time
        extended to 2 ms.

   With Logg's knowledge and approval:

        Glenn is going over to Manufacturing early Wednesday morning, bringing
        back the board I got from them. (It wouldn't screw up on my bench.)
        He will sit with Jim until they get a board that has the Problem, at
        which point Glenn will produce the new ROMs and put them in the board.
        They will then try to determine if the new ROMs have cured the 
        problem.

    Power Supply rise time could also have a bearing on the Problem.

									2 of 2
 
3. There is the Other Problem, which may, in fact, be related to the original 
   Problem. The Right Seat Game has a tendency to generate errors of some
   type or another. Not the Left Seat. Just the Right Seat.

   The Right Seat produces +15V Reg. for both boards' 12 Bit A/D. It also
   has the Rump Thump, the Fan, and the A/C Switch.


PCLINK

 We have gotten some boards from Karen and fired them up. One of the parts
 does not have Power and Ground connected.

Steel Talons

This is what I know so far. I am distributing it so others can comment on it.

The Big Sympton is the GSP Timeout Error.

This is definitely caused by the GSP program crashing.

The GSP program crashes because, after powerup, one or more of the VRAMs
do not work, and nothing can be done in software to make them work. (The
GSP Simple Memory Test identifies the miscreant VRAMs.)

If power is removed and reapplied, sometimes it will work and sometimes it
won't.

I do not know of anything that will cause a VRAM to permanently not work
in a circuit until power is removed and reapplied, except for Latch-Up.
(This is when the voltage on an input is greater than the IC's VCC. This
triggers an SCR that is part of the gate structure but is not a problem as
long as the input does not get higher than the IC's operating voltage.)

Things that have been tried:

  1. I made Steel Talons Self-Test ROMs with the GSP Reset time extended 
     to 2 ms. Made no difference.

  2. I had Jim remove the +15V and -22V from a board at his test station; 
     maybe it was causing the VRAMs to latch up. Made no difference.

  3. As per Ken Williams' memo, when the Samsung VRAMs are replaced with 
     Micron VRAMs, there does not seem to be a problem.

  4. Mary has checked around; only Samsung and Hitachi still make 64Kx4 VRAMs.

  5. Glenn brought a boardset back and we fired it up on a bench with a
     variable supply. 

     When we brought the voltage up slowly it screwed up every time. 

     We kept the supply on and switched it with just wire leads. It didn't 
     screw up. 

     We returned to bringing it up slowly. It had stopped screwing up. A short
     time later the VRAM in one particular position started screwing up every 
     time. 

     If, with the board powered, I remove the VRAM and plug it back in, it 
     will usually work.

     Replacing it with a Micron VRAM fixed it.

     Swapping the Samsung VRAM with another one from a different location 
     seems to fix it, at least temporarily.

  6. We removed the 0.1 uF bypass capacitor associated with one of the VRAMs
     and measured it. It was, indeed, 0.1 uF. We added a 1 uF tantalum 
     capacitor to the area. Made no difference.

  7. I thought that maybe there was a problem with the plated-thru holes to
     +5V and Ground. I measured the resistance between +5V on every VRAM and
     a +5V Testpoint with a low resistance Ohmmeter and they seemed ok. I did
     the same with the VRAM Grounds. I also did it with the Bypass Caps. They
     all seem solidly connected.

The VRAMs are now being put in sockets and I think this is a good idea.

  7. At this point Bonnie decided she needed some technical support because
     she had some MultiSync Boards that didn't work. I explained what the 
     Samsung symptoms were and that it didn't sound like what she was
     experiencing. She still wanted me to fix it. I told her I didn't have
     time but I suggested a few things anyway, starting with checking the +5V.

     Shortly afterwards, she sent Farrokkh to see me, with a board to fix. I
     asked him if he had checked the +5V. He said, "no."

     Someone noticed that the Strain Gage Amp had been stuffed. I suggested 
     to him that he remove the LED to disconnect the Amp from the A/D inputs.

     He left.

I would like to find out if there is still a VRAM problem when the
board is powered solely by +5V.

On Jim's test setup, either turn off the appropriate supplies or use a 
pin extractor to remove +15V and -22V from P1.

On a real game with the Problem, unplug the Rump Thump Board.

If you want to wait until I come in, that's fine.

Jim fixed the board with the sockets and tried the other brand VRAM and could
not get them to fail. If the Samsung VRAM are in they fail quite often. He 
also noticed a glitch on the reset line immediately after power-on and is 
wondering if this is ok. He gave me a power supply like the one he uses so I 
can connect it to the board in the lab and try to duplicate the problem over 
here. Also Don Wrightnour has initiated a deviation to go to sockets for the 
VRAM.

THE LATEST ON OUR END.
WE PULLED THE SAMSUNG VRAMS OUT OF A MULTISYNC WHICH WAS FAILING
SOCKETS WERE INSTALLED AND JIM LOADED MICRON TECHNOLOGY 150ns PARTS AND
THE BOARD WAS CYCLED ON AND OFF 100 TIMES AND IT WOULD NOT FAIL. THE SAM-
SUNG DEVICES WERE REINSTALLED AND THE BOARD FAILED IMMEDIATELY. IT APPEARS
THAT THE SAMSUNG ARE NOT COMPATIBLE ON SOME BOARDS. 
I SENT A MAIL MSG TO GLEN BUT LATER HEARD HE WILL NOT BE HERE TODAY. I 
HAVE 30 BOARDS IN TECH REPAIR NOW FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND WE NEED HELP 
TO FIND A FIX. OF COURSE WE ONLY HAVE THE SAMSUNG PARTS IN STOCK AND I DO 
NOT KNOW AVAILABILITY OF OTHER MANUFACTURER PARTS. BURNIAS IS CHECKING THAT.
PRESENTLY WE WILL BE INSTALLING SOCKETS IN ALL 16 VRAM LOCATIONS SO IF THE 
DECISION IS MADE TO CHANGE ALL THE PARTS IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER. 
COULD YOU PLEASE HELP US OUT IN THIS DILEMMA?

Re: Status Report
Dt: 3 September 1991

To Get to the Chase:

1. If we can get a board that never fails and one that always fails, we should
   swap the VRAMs and see if the problem travels with the VRAMs.

2. We should build 100 boards with Samsung parts and 100 boards with Micron
   parts, subject them to the same testing, and look at the results.
=============================================================================

Steel Talons 
------------
When a board fails regularly, swapping two VRAMs does not move the problem.
This would indicate a problem with the board.

But, when a board fails regularly, replacing a 'bad' Samsung VRAM with one
made by Micron does cure the problem.

There may be some kind of board problem to which the Samsung VRAM is 
susceptible but the Micron part is not.

In particular, because the symptom cannot be 'fixed' except by powering down
the board, this implies that something in the Samsung VRAM is latching up.

Things to Consider:

1. We have shipped about 200 games (400 boards) with Samsung VRAMs soldered in.

     a. Were the tests that were done on the games sufficient to insure that 
        these games will be ok?

     b. If not, what do we do?
     	  1. Have them send the boards back for Atari to replace the VRAMs?
	     Can the VRAMs be removed without damaging the board?

	  2. Make a board that allows the game software to turn off its own
	     power to 'try again' if the VRAMs don't come up properly?

	  3. Can the problem be fixed by replacing the power supply with one
	     that has a faster rise time? Can we use the old ones in other 
	     games?

     c. Who will pay? Will Samsung admit their VRAMs are defective? Will the
        PCB vendor admit that their boards are defective? Do we sue them?

2. Should I design and build a device to test that the VRAMs come up properly?
   This would probably be a modified Motor and Fan Amp board that would be
   used to power cycle the +5V power supply a few dozen times. Would that
   even be enough? Assuming it was tested in the game would it shorten the 
   life of the power supply?
									2 of 2

3. What are the implications for the Street Driver?
    a. Can we find enough Micron parts?

    b. Should we change to 128Kx8 VRAMs? 
       1. TI's are not available yet in production quantities.
       2. TI's are in the Small Outline J package. (DIP with J leads with 
	  50 Mil lead spacing, normally surface mounted. Are sockets 
	  available?)  

    c. The most popular VRAM seems to be the 256Kx4, which is available in a
       ZIP package. This uses standard thru-hole technology and sockets 
       are available. The MultiSync with 34010 could not be converted easily;
       perhaps it cannot be converted at all because of the dynamic bus
       configuration. 

    d. Should the MultiSync be redesigned with a 34020? Can it be done on
       a four layer board? Should it use a Pallette IC instead of the current 
       scheme to save $14? Should it use 1M EPROMs instead of 27512s? Should
       it use a 68EC020 instead of the 68010? Where does it end? Who will 
       design it?

    e. Can the Street Driver use Sam's growth motion object board?

Wednesday

1. Joan gave me 16 Hitachi 120 ns VRAMs which I installed and tested with at 
   least 12 power-up cycles. They worked just fine. The parts Joan has been 
   able to locate are 150 ns which should work with no problem but I asked to
   to test some anyway.

2. Chris Drobny came to see me about a Motor and Fan Amp board for Motomania.

   a. I gave him a blank board and a transformer and recommended he ask Karen 
      to build him a board. 
 
   b. I suggested he get a schematic from Erik.

   c. I went over the schematic with Chris and explained how the circuit 
      worked.

   d. I strongly recommended that his programmer implement the Self-Test for
      the board that I did for Bonnie.

   e. I told him that after having spent most of my time since last December
      working on other people's projects I would no longer support other
      people's projects. Like his. Especially when I found out that Dennis had
      decided to use a Leta even though I told him (through Chris) that it 
      wouldn't work in a feedback system because it loses counts.

   f. I offered to give him the OrCad files so he could take over the board.

   g. I told him he shouldn't use the Motor and Fan Amp board because there
      was a better way to do it.

  Shortly afterwards, Rich Moore came to see me to thank me for the work I
  was doing on the Steel Talons VRAM problem and to ask me to provide full
  information to Chris Drobny since I had decided not to support his project.

  Drobny sure didn't waste any time. He must have gone directly from my office
  to Rich's.


3. Glenn and I have tried some pullup resistors to improve the RAS/CAS power-
   up characteristics. Glenn will have Jim Buchanan try it on a few bad 
   boards.

Thursday
--------
1. Glenn had Jim Buchanan take one of his bad boards and remove the 10pF caps
   on the Serial Clock Lines. (I promised Samsung I would try it.) It did
   not fix it.

2. Glenn had Jim add the four 10K pullup resistors to a bad board. The board
   worked. They removed the resistors. The board still worked.

3. Jim modified another board. It worked. He removed the resistors. It didn't 
   work. He put the resistors back on. It worked.

4. I have asked Glenn to have Jim modify the remainder of his 30 bad boards
   so we can get a better idea of how effective it is.


Warning: 
   The information that Samsung has provided me on this bug came from Ron
   Shick (Shuck?) whom I believe is their field applications engineer. The
   information was that if RAS and CAS are not brought up together during
   power-up the part might lock-up. I do not have specifics like how close 
   together they must be. Is it 1V, 0.1V, 0.01V, or 1 ms, 1 us, or 1 ns?

   These pullup resistors improve the way RAS and CAS come up but do not make
   them come up perfectly together. 

   All of the games that we have shipped with Samsung VRAMs have the potential
   to have this problem. They should have the pullup resistors added.

   All new games should be built with Hitachi VRAMs as much as is possible.

     1. I do not know how good a fix the resistors are.

     2. I do not have a lot of confidence in Samsung. What else haven't they
	told us about?

   Continuing to use Samsung VRAMs entails two risks:

     1. The Samsung VRAMs may have another undocumented way to screw up games;

     2. Manufacturing would request that the MultiSync board be changed so it 
        would contain the mods. Making changes to a board this size that is 
        already in production and for which there will be no prototypes is 
        very risky. Do we still have the original SciCards system or would 
        the board be done from data converted to the new system?

Jim,

   These are the mods for MultiSync Boards with Samsung VRAMs:

	1. Connect a 10K 1/8W Resistor from 120_U pin 18 to +5V.
	2. Connect a 10K 1/8W Resistor from 120_U pin 16 to +5V.
	3. Connect a 10K 1/8W Resistor from 120_U pin 14 to +5V.
	4. Connect a 10K 1/8W Resistor from 160_U pin  8 to +5V.

	5. Cut and lift 120_U pin 1
	6. Connect a wire jumper from 120_U pin 1 to 120_K pin 2.


   Let Rick know how mods 5 and 6 work out.


Thanks,


Jed

Re: This Weekend's Tests
Dt: 22 September 1991


I did more VRAM tests. They did not show any errors.

I checked to make sure the 34010 is producing Refresh Cycles. It is.

I removed the 34010 Oscillator module and installed pins so I could try
different modules.

There seemed to be fewer errors at 40 MHz, but there were still errors.

There seemed to be the same errors at 48 MHz and 50 MHz.

There seemed to be more errors at 60 MHz. but it still ran ok. The amazing 
thing is that it worked at all. 

For a time it seemed to run better at 48 MHz with an NDK oscillator instead
of the Fox module that it came with.

If you think we should pursue this I think we have a function generator
that can be programmed for frequency and duty cycle. We would also need
a fast oscilloscope.

Otherwise, the following are the only other things I can think of right now:

   1. Try to figure out some more memory patterns to test for.

   2. Have a programmer set things up so we can have the GSP put up one thing
      at a time and then stop. That way we can determine what operation is
      making the VRAMs screw up. This would have to be interactive. The 
      previous approach took four hours to try one thing.

   3. Is there a correlation between the good and bad boards with the
      manufacturer of the oscillator module at XOSC2?

   4. Give up.


It would be nice to figure this thing out because it might have implications
for a board with 128Kx8 VRAMs.

Re: Hitachi VRAM Problem
Dt: 23 September 1991


There is a problem that occurs when Steel Talons boards use Hitachi VRAMs.

Memory locations change when they are not supposed to.

When this happens in the display buffer the result is bad pixels on the 
screen.

When this happens in the area that contains the GSP program the result is that
the GSP program crashes.

1. This problem does not happen when Samsung or Micron VRAMs are used.

2. There is no common factor between good boards and bad boards other than
   the VRAM manufacturer.

3. The VRAMs pass the standard memory tests but still screw up in the game
   depending on what is on the screen.

4. On the bad board I have been examining I have checked evrything I can think
   of checking.

5. There does not seem to be anything that consistently affects the way things
   screw up except:

   	a. There are fewer errors when VCC is 4.75V or 5.25V than when it 
           is 5.00V.

	b. Changing the GSP clock from 48 MHz to 40 MHz seems to reduce the 
	   rate at which the errors occur. Changing it to 60 MHz accelerates
	   the rate at which errors occur.

   If there were a system timing error, changing the clock from 48 MHz to 
   60 MHz should have made it crash right away. It didn't. And it simply 
   accelerated the VRAM errors; it did not change the type of error.

6. There is insufficient programming support to do an extensive investigation
   of the GSP code. 


Recommendations:
	1. Get rid of all Hitachi VRAMs.
	2. Remove Hitachi VRAMs from the AVL.

Re: MultiSync II
Dt: 24 September 1991


I propose to make the following changes to the MultiSync Board to create
MultiSync II.

1. Replace the sixteen 64Kx8 VRAMs with eight 128Kx8 VRAMs. 

   Polygon fill time will remain the same but we will have 1 MB of VRAM 
   instead of 512K. This is the same as in the original Driver Main Board but 
   it will not have the same peak polygon fill rate due to the memory 
   orgination.  

   MultiSync II can be configured to produce the Medium Res format (512x384).

2. Change the sixteen 27512 program ROM sockets to accept 512K EPROMs, 
   1M EPROMs, 1M Flash EPROMs, or 1M Static RAMs.

   The configuration will be as follows:

     ROM0 is always EPROM. (The program has to be able to start.)

     ROM1 and ROM2 are EPROM, Flash EPROM, or RAM depending on jumpers
     1.P0 and 1.P1 .

     ROM3 and ROM4 are EPROM, Flash EPROM, or RAM depending on jumpers
     2.P0 and 2.P1 .	

     ROM5 and ROM6 are EPROM, Flash EPROM, or RAM depending on jumpers
     3.P0 and 3.P1 .

     ROM7 is EPROM, Flash EPROM, or RAM depending on jumpers 4.P0 and 4.P1 .
     ( ROM7 is connected to SLOOP)

     All sections must select 512K EPROM if any one does. In 1M modes the
     sections may be mixed and matched. (27512s may still be used in sections
     selected as 1M EPROM as long as the programmer is aware of the address
     gap.)

3. With my luck the 8Kx8 SRAMs will become history. I propose to replace the
   two pair of 8Kx8s with one pair of 32Kx8s. This will also give twice as 
   much program RAM.

 
There are two consequences of these changes.

1. To accomodate the extra Program RAM I will have to move the address of
   the ZeroPower RAMs and the DUART. Therefore the board will not be able
   to use existing EPROMs. The program would have to be recompiled.

2. In order to free up board space to accomodate the GALs needed to do the 
   EPROM thing, I will have to remove the SCUM circuitry.

Re: Status

I was planning on working on the MultiSync II Board with 128Kx8 VRAMs.

If you want me to keep working on the Hitachi VRAM problem instead of
MultiSync II, then fine.

If you want me to work on MultiSync II then go to the section on MultiSync II.


Pursuing the Hitachi VRAM problem:

1. What are the results of running the board from a linear supply?

2. I will compare each Hitachi VRAM timing spec with TI's. This will take a 
   day or two.

3. I would like to run Race Drivin' (with ADSP II and not DS III) on a board 
   with Hitachi VRAMs. 

4. Was the GSP Code changed from Race Drivin' to Steel Talons?

5. I am rewriting the VRAM memory tests in 34010 assembly and adding more
   tests. I do not have the source code for Max's tests but I suspect they
   are in C.
 
6. If none of the above produces results the only thing left is to set up
   a system where we can go to the screen that shows the problem, and
   selectively enable pieces of code in hopes of being able to associate
   the problem with specific VRAM operations.

   This requires someone familiar with the GSP Code. 

   My previous experience with getting GSP CODE changed indicates that there
   is no person in this company who knows anything about the GSP CODE or who
   cares; especially the Steel Talons programmers.

MultiSync II
------------

     The 34010 will only produce /RAS-only refresh cycles for VRAMs with RAS 
and CAS separated by 8 bits or fewer. The 48C121 has 9 bits of RAS address, 
therefore requiring that /CAS-before-/RAS Refresh mode be used. (/CAS-before-
/RAS Refresh mode uses a refresh counter that is internal to the VRAM.)

     The 34010 can be programmed to produce /RAS-before-/CAS Refresh but the
MultiSync hardware was not designed for it. That is the reason for the
circuit change.

     In order to verify that it works I would like to modify a MultiSync
board in a Steel Talons board set, since Steel Talons seems to be 
particularly hard on the hardware.

     Even though the new circuit will still work with RAS-only Refresh cycles
the object of the exercise is to test the /CAS-before-/RAS Refresh mode.
The current 64Kx8 VRAMs also support this mode so they can be used for this
test even though it would be nice to test the 48C121s as well.

     The GSP Initialization code MUST BE CHANGED TO SELECT /RAS-Before-/CAS
REFRESH MODE. In Self-Test this initialization is done by the 68010 and I will
take care of it.

     Someone has to change the Routine in the GAME. This initialization might 
also be performed in GSP CODE; therefore the GSP CODE would have to be 
changed.

     I will not take responsibility for changing GAME CODE. 

     I will not take responsibility for changing GSP CODE. 

     My previous experience with getting GSP CODE changed indicates that there
is no person in this company who knows anything about the GSP CODE or who
cares; especially the Steel Talons programmers.
 
     If there is no programmer willing to take responsibility for making these
changes, then any further work on this board is a waste of my time.

Road Riot
---------
I spent time with Farrokh so he could release the EPROM and the GAL on the
DSP COMLINK Board which is what they called the DSP LINK Board after they
moved the connector and added some other things.

The Boot EPROM appeared to be unchanged from Steel Talons (since it reported
the same Self-Test and Program Version Numbers and had the same checksums as
the Steel Talons part) so I gave Farrokh the Steel Talons Programmed Part
Number.

The GAL is used to decode addresses and is the same one that I gave them
with the DSP LINK Board. I made a new file and changed the documentation to
say 'Road Riot' and changed the User Signature to the part number Farrokh
is going to use.

Total time was about 30 minutes.

Steel Talons RFI Problem
------------------------
Thursday (1 hour):

   Rick Meyette informed me that the Steel Talons unit sent to Japan failed
   the MITI RFI test.

   He determined that the problem is a 43 MHz spike coming from the board set 
   on the Left Side but he could not find what was causing it.

   I recommended that he swap the left and right board sets. Ricks Owens did 
   so and reported the problem was still on the Left Side.

Friday (4 hours):

   Both Boardsets are clean; they are not producing the problem. The video
   cable in the game harness is very long and is cabled with every other
   cable in the game. Connecting the video to the monitor by a separate cable
   instead of the video cable in the harness improved the situation a great
   deal but did not fix it completely.

   I asked Rick to connect his Video Test Generator. He did. It still did it.
   The problem is in the monitor. This one was a Hantarex. 

   The monitor in Japan is a Wells Gardner. So we have to do this thing over
   again. We do, however, already know that emissons can be reduced by 
   modifying the video harness. We also know that we could increase the 
   capacitors on the video outputs if necessary, without degrading the 
   picture. (The filter time constant is currently 4.7 ns.)

-----
Mary Burnias has informed me that she has been ordered to not give parts
to me ever again. All parts are to go through Components. This is 
unacceptable. This places the timely development of MultiSync II at risk. 

Rick Meyette didn't know anything about it.

I have not done anything else about it because I am waiting for you to come 
back first.

Steel Talons RFI Problem
------------------------
I have spent several hours with Rick Meyette on this.

What it has come down to is:

   1. The problem RF is related to GSP activity.

   2. Changing the VRAMs from Samsung (120ns) to TI (150ns) reduced
      the 48 MHz component considerably but increased the one at 32 MHz.

   3. The game passes FCC but not MITI.

   4. The problem is made worse because the game boards are mounted on
      the back door. This increases the harness length considerably which
      makes it a better antenna for RF. Meyette also would have liked the
      board sets mounted differently. They should have listened to him.

Rick Meyette and I have run out of ideas, so he is going to try a shield.


Hitachi VRAMs
-------------
I have written more VRAM Tests. Unfortunately, Alan took my one and only
MultiSync board for testing Hitachi VRAMs.

He did manage to find it. It was returned without the Steel Talons EPROMs
which included the special pair that disabled screen Erase.

The new tests did not find any VRAM errors.

This board had the Hitachi VRAMs that I received from Joan for testing.
I put Steel Talons ROMs in the board and let it warm up. Pixel errors do
appear on the Blue attract screen but are almost unnoticeable without
Erase disabled.
 
I installed the original Hitachi VRAMs that I had sent to Hitachi for 
testing. (Hitachi could find noting wrong with them.)

After warmup the pixel errors were very noticeable, but the memory tests
could not detect any errors.

I have compared 20 timing specifications of TI and Hitachi VRAMs and found
nothing to suggest there would be a problem. (There are about 50 more check.)

I am informed that we have disposed of the Hitachi VRAMs and that there is no
need to continue the investigation. Good.

Regarding the 64Kx4 DRAMs used with the MSP. The most elegant solution is to

These are the current possibilities for MSP memory:

     1. Keep the 64Kx4 DRAMs and hope we will be able to get them if we need

Road Riot
---------
Rick Meyette has been having some problems getting Road Riot to pass FCC.
He is having capacitors added to the Road Riot DSPCOMLINK Board. Somehow
it got made without them. (The Steel Talons DSPCOM Board has the caps
because he was able to determine that they were needed before they were
ordered.) He will try to have the boards held up if they haven't been made
yet.


Hitachi VRAMs

The new tests have failed to provide a clue as to why the Hitachi VRAMs won't

Since we have now disposed of the Hitachi VRAMs there is no need to continue

But I am going to somehow determine if Steel Talons is turning off the

I have asked Logg to supply me with EPROMs to make Steel Talons work with
CAS-before-RAS Refresh as a final test.

The following companies are alleged to make 128Kx8 VRAMs:

   Texas Instruments:	TMS48C121-80, -10, -12   (80 ns, 100 ns, 120 ns)

     2. The original Applied Research share of Steel Talons was too low.

     3. On an absolute basis the amount I am slated to receive from

Fr: Jed Margolin
Re: MultiSync II
Dt: 6 November 1991


In MultiSync II the 64Kx8 VRAMs will be changed to 128Kx8 VRAMs. 

Because the 34010 produces VRAM RAS-only refresh for 8 bits and the 128Kx8 
requires 9 bits of refresh it is necessary to change the refresh mode to 
CAS-before-RAS Refresh. (This mode utilizes the VRAM's internal 9 bit refresh 
counter.) 

This will require both a hardware and a software change.

I have had a Steel Talons MultiSync board modified with the new refresh
circuitry and have changed the Self-Test software to have the GSP produce
CAS-before-RAS Refresh. It seems to work. (The 64Kx4 VRAMs also have the
capability to do CAS-before-RAS Refresh.)

However, before I can proceed with the MultiSync II board I need to verify 
that Steel Talons will work with this change. I would like a set of EPROMs
(checksummed) with the changes. It may only be one pair.

The change consists of initializing the GSP's CONTROL register with RM=$1
instead of RM=$0.

Max thinks that you are probably using his initialization code (which he
got from me) in a 68010 routine called GSPINIT. The registers are
initialized from a table. You need to change the table and make sure there
is no other code that changes the refresh mode. 

It is possible that there is GSP code that changes the CONTROL register, so 
the GSP code must be examined to make sure it does not change the refresh 
mode.

If I change the MSP DRAMs from 64Kx4 to 128Kx8 you will need to make a similar
change in the MSP initialization code.

I would like to have these EPROMs this week to avoid delaying MultiSync II.

If you decide to not make these changes for me at this time, I will not be 
able to warranty that Steel Talons will work on MultiSync II.

Note that CAS-before-RAS Refresh will not work on unmodified hardware.

MultiSync II
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
I have received EPROMs from Logg that have the GSP produce CAS-Before-RAS
Refresh. It turns out that all of the Game Code we have released has the 
GSP generate a refresh cycle every 5 us. It only needs to to produce one 
every 10 us. (Self-Test has it generate refresh every 10 us.)

The game runs but produces pixel errors on some screens. The error count
on a game run overnight was Zero in all categories. 

I have measured the signals coming from the GAL and they look very good.
I have tried a bipolar PAL but there was no difference.

Freezing the 68010 makes the pixel errors disappear. Since the 68010 tells the
GSP when to change buffers we may be looking at buffers that are out of sync.

This board, with the GAL, when loaded with the original program, runs 
perfectly with no pixel errors.

Theory: The pixel errors may be due to an error introduced when the Eds were
        changing GSP code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
On Tuesday Mary Burnias called me to say that Tom Dempsey from TI was
here and could we meet. Naturally, I said ok.

Imagine my joy when I saw Tom Smith at the meeting. The reason for his
presence was not explained.

In the course of the meeting Tom Smith wanted to know why I wasn't putting
2M Byte EPROMs on MultiSync II. I expect he will bring it up at the staff 
meeting so here are the reasons:

   1. I divided the Program Memory space into four sections:

      a. ROM 0 can be 512K EPROMs or 1M EPROMs.
      b. ROM1, ROM2, ROM3 can be 512K EPROMs, 1M EPROMs, 1M Flash EPROMs, 
         or 1M SRAMs.
      c. ROM4, ROM5, ROM6 can be 512K EPROMs, 1M EPROMs, 1M Flash EPROMs, 
         or 1M SRAMs.
      d. ROM7 (which is connected to SLOOP) 512K EPROMs, 1M EPROMs, 
         1M Flash EPROMs, or 1M SRAMs.

      Adding another mode would require giving up an existing mode and/or 
      increasing the complexity of the decoding scheme and increasing the
      number of GALs to implement it. I do not have space for more GALs.

   2. Increasing the Program memory space from 2M Bytes (16 x 1M EPROMs) to
      4M Bytes (16 x 2M EPROMs) would require extensive changes to the
      board's memory map. Going to 2M EPROMs without increasing the Program
      Memory space would mean limiting the number of 2M EPROMs to eight, two
      of which would be connected to SLOOP. Program and data residing in
      SLOOPed EPOMs is very inconvenient to access. There would now be twice
      the amount accessed by SLOOP.
									2 of 2

   3. I envision programmers using the mix and match capabilty of 1M EPROMs 
      and 1M SRAMs during development to work on portions of the program in
      SRAM and then make EPROMs. Mixing 1M SRAMs and 2M EPROMs would require
      the programmers to compile code at different addresses depending which
      part of the code they were working on.

      Of course, they could do all the development using 1M SRAMs and 
      1M EPROMs and wait for the Day of Production to try their program
      in 2M EPROMs.

      Either way, they would blame me for making their life difficult.

   4. Redoing the memory would take time and its complexity would increase the
      chance of an error. I am already running out time to do this board.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The choices for MSP Memory:

	1. 128K x 8 DRAMs	[2 x 4.95 = $9.90]
	2. 256K x 8 DRAMs	[4 x 3.75 = $15.00]
	3. 128K x 8 VRAMs	[ 2 x $8.50 = $17.00]

The 128K x 8 DRAMs are sole sourced by TI. Lead times are 2 - 14 weeks.

They have 30K - 40K in inventory. If they are still in inventory when we
need them, the lead time is 2 weeks.

If they have to make more, the lead time is 14 weeks.

The die is the same as the 256K x 4 DRAM except for the metalization.

The 256K x 4 DRAMs are made by lots of people. Using them in the MSP
will not, however, produce more useable memory than the 128K x 8s because
of the 34010's Bus multiplexer. It only supports an 8 bit offset between
RAS and CAS; the 256K x 4 DRAM has a 9 bit offset; so half of the memory is 
wasted.

So......

   If I use 128K x 8 DRAMs I will be a Bum if the parts delay production

   				or

   If I use 256K x 4 DRAMs I will be a Bum for increasing the cost of the
   game unnecessarily.

Re: Pots for Street Driver
Dt: 18 November 1991


I talked to Ray Sherman who is an old hand at pots. A few years ago he was 
asked to find an off-the-shelf pot, and did, but it was never used.

I asked him to find a pot with the following characteristics:
	Single Section;
	10K Audio Taper;
	3/8" threaded bushing panel mount
	Solder Terminals

He already has one except it has pc terminals. He expects to be able to find
one off-the-shelf with solder terminals.
	
I had Dennis MTO a few 119022-103 pots to get a look at it. According to
MANMAN they are cheap and we have 2534 in inventory. Unfortunatey they 
are PC-mount only and cannot be panel mounted.

I created a list of all "119" part numbers and looked them up in MANMAN.
I then eliminated all parts that were not potentiometers or which had
zero quantity in stock.


This leaves us with:

PART NUMBER: 119006-103                  	Has 3/8 Bushing, can be used
DESCRIPTION: POTENTIOMETER,DUAL,10K_OHMS 	until we get the real ones.
TOTAL UNIT COST:                 2.622
QUANTITY ON HAND:                 557.   

PART NUMBER: 119008-1001                         Linear Taper. And too 
DESCRIPTION: POTENTIOMETER,LONG_LIFE,5KOHM       expensive. 
TOTAL UNIT COST:                 3.290
QUANTITY ON HAND:               17746.   

PART NUMBER: 119016-500  			Arg.
DESCRIPTION: RHEOSTAT,WW,50_OHM,12.5W
TOTAL UNIT COST:                 4.100
QUANTITY ON HAND:                3114. 

PART NUMBER: 119022-103
DESCRIPTION: POT,10K_OHM,.25W,AUDIO_TAPER	Not panel mount.
TOTAL UNIT COST:                 1.023
QUANTITY ON HAND:                2534.

I recommend we design the panel for the pot I asked Ray to find (3/8" threaded
bushing) and in the meantime use up the 119006-103 .                 

This means that we need to verify that there actually are a few hundred 
119006-103 parts in inventory. We also need to make sure Tom Smith doesn't
scrap them before we can release a parts list with it on it.

Monday
------
I came in to find:

   1. Joe had been pulled off MultiSync II to finish Leon's work on the Sound 
      Board for Relief Pitcher because Leon was on vacation. 

      It seems that McCarthy did this on his own authority. It also seems that
      on one or more days last week Joe was taken off MultiSync II during the 
      morning. It explains why progress on MultiSync II has been so slow. 

      I cannot work like this.  

      I recommend that you have all your future board work done by an outside 
      service bureau because Art's group cannot be trusted.

   2. The VAX lines to my both my PC and my AMS were down due to a Server
      Serial Board burning up. Service was restored to my PC late in the
      day. Service to the AMS was not restored until Tuesday.

I spent most of the day working on the 2105 code for DS III Sound. I also
starting bringing up the Street Drivin' DS III boards. This required
burning EPROMs because I could not download from the VAX. If I ever have
time I will convert to PC-based Tools.


Tuesday and Wednesday
---------------------
I did my part to support the push to get the Street Drivin' field test units 
out.

I continued to work on Street Drivin' Self-Test.

Street Driver Documentation
---------------------------
Matt and I generated an AROMREL1.DOC file for all of the software used in the 
Field Test Unit and created the directory [Driver.Street] . The object code
for the Field test Unit is in [Driver.Street.ROMREV1] .


DS III
------
I worked with Matt in integrating the Sound Program with Sound Self-Test.

I continued with the 68010 part of DS III Sound Self-test.

I have brought up additional DS III Boards.


DSK Board Addressing
--------------------
I persuaded the guys to use a DS II Graphics board for program RAM (512KB)
instead of the Program RAM Board (1MB). The Program RAM Board would have 
required changing the GALs to relocate the DSK addresses. Program updates
would have to be coordinated with GAL changes. On Field Test units, too.
Then they would have to be changed back when the MultiSync II Board becomes 
real because the only place to put the DSK memory was where the DS II Graphics
RAM lives.

I moved the Self-Test addresses for the DSPLINK Board only to find out that
it uses Peter's code and for some inexplicable reason he took Self-Test out
of the Boot ROM.

Therefore the DSPLINK cannot be tested except by removing Peter's ROM and
installing mine. This is stupid.
 

DS III Filters
--------------
I have not had the filters changed yet because I need to be able to play 
sounds on it first. It was more important to integrate Self-Test with the
Sound Program first. I have not gotten Self-Test to the point where it can 
play sounds.(The new filters have a higher frequency than the old filters.)

MultiSync II
------------
Plots were delivered on Thursday. I am taking Friday and the weekend to check
them.

I have submitted a CER for the VRAMs (TI and Micron) and requested Restricted
Approval until I test the parts in a MultiSync II board.

I have marked up the MultiSync II schematics and asked Joe to work on it right
away and generate a parts list so Karen can get the parts from Manufacturing
before they close.

 
Getting it made
---------------
I don't expect it will be possible to receive boards until January. 

Assuming boards are received on January 2 they must first have the VRAMs 
mounted (they are SMD). Tom Smith's approval is required to have Purchasing 
issue a work order with Fine Pitch Technology. (You get to arrange it with
Tom Smith.) 

Then, assuming that Karen was able to get the parts before Manufacturing
closed on Dec 20, she will stuff the boards. I want the boards wave soldered, 
I do not want the boards hand soldered. Don Wrightnour is willing to come in 
during the first week of January to fire up the wave solder and do the boards 
if you will arrange it with Bob Stewart.


Pots
----
Ray Sherman has found some nice cheap volume control pots. 

The best one is by Bourns: 10K, Audio Taper, panel mount, 3/8" bushing, comes 
with mounting hardware, shaft is 1/4" diameter and 3/4" long.

Quote:	100	$1.81
	500	$1.05
	1K	$0.85
	5K	$0.76

Atari p/n is 119028-103

Lead Time: 8 weeks

I thought this was going to be an off-the-shelf item but it apparently didn't
work out that way.

   1. Is the 3/4" long shaft ok?

   2. We should either order 100 for prototypes ($181.00)
			or
      Manufacturing should order 1000 for the Street Driver run ($850.00)

Ray expects samples in 3 weeks. We can't wait that long to order them.

MultiSync II
------------
I checked the MultiSync II plots last weekend and found:
	1. The footprint for the 32Kx8 SRAMs had not been done for dual 
           (0.3/0.6) packages.
	2. There were several voids (in the form of slots) in both the Ground 
           and +5V layers.

I marked the plots and placed them on Joe's desk Sunday so they would be there
when he got in.

When I came in on Monday  he explained that the slots had something to do with
heat transfer during wave solder. They had done it on the Road Riot FSG board
and apparently thought they were supposed to do it on every board. Joe didn't 
know who had made this decision. 

I told him that these rectangular slots disturbed the distribution of currents
in the Ground and +5V planes and were, in fact, antennas. I asked him to take
them off, and he did. 

Late Monday he sent out for Film.

I spent the rest of Monday in a department meeting.


The film arrived on Tuesday. I spent most of Tuesday trying to get the boards 
ordered. 

I also corrected Joe's initial parts list. The idea is to have Karen get parts
from Manufacturing before they close. Karen is out with a back injury and
Emmette does not know when she will be back.

So far we have ordered:
	(26) MultiSync PC Boards
	(100) 1MB SRAMs (for development)
	(100) 128Kx8 VRAMs
	(100) GAL16V8-15
	(100) 10K Audio Pots (8 weeks) 
	(100) 74BCT29843 9-bit transparent latches

We should have enough of these parts to build 17 boards

The remainder of the parts were used on Steel Talons and we presumably have
them in inventory.


DS III
------
I am continuing to make slow but steady progress on Self-Test.

MultiSync II
------------
The boards are due in on January 2 (Thursday).

Rob Bryant very kindly volunteered to pull kits for the boards. We will
do it for the 25 boards. Since I didn't order enough VRAMs for all 25
boards Rob will order the remainder and charge it to John Ray's account
(with his permission, of course).

Rob Bryant has also set up the deal to have have Fine Pitch attach the
VRAMs (which are 40 pin SOJ) on January 6 (Monday). Fine Pitch wants a
Solder Paste Mask and I have informed PC of this.

After the VRAMs are attached Karen or Emmette will presumably stuff a few 
boards and have them wave soldered by Don Wrightnour.

MultiSync II
------------
The boards are due in on January 2 (Thursday). I have sent Melanie a Mail 
Message asking her to have the boards delivered to our building. If they are 
sent to Receiving we won't get them.

We are scheduled to deliver the boards to Fine Pitch on January 6 (Monday)
and receive them with the VRAMs attached on January 10 (Friday). Rob Bryant 
has set up the deal with Fine Pitch. Fine Pitch wanted a Solder Paste Mask 
so Joe did one and gave it to Rob.

I don't know who is going to stuff them, or if Don Wrightnour will be
available to run them through Wave Solder.

Rob Bryant very kindly volunteered to pull kits for the boards. We will
do it for the 25 boards. Since I didn't order enough VRAMs for all 25
boards Rob will order the remainder and charge it to John Ray's account

Dennis filled out purchase reqs to get the parts that were not in stock.


DS III
------
I am continuing to make slow but steady progress on Self-Test.

Most of the menu tests for DS III Sound are almost done. There is a problem
with the DAC circuits that cause a 2.5 MHz oscillation. I have used this
circuit in Driver Sound and DS II and not had this problem. The boards that
oscillate use a PMI DAC. The boards that do not oscillate use an AMD DAC.
I will investigate further.

DS III Sound presents a special problem because Matt did not integrate it
with Self-Test. He changed his software so it would work with Self-Test
and also so it would fit in a 2105. I have all the software but it will 
require changes of an unspecified nature in the 68010 code. We also need
to install Play Sounds.

I still need to do the Automatic part of Self-Test.

After reviewing the Patent Application "DRIVER TRAINING SYSTEM WITH MULTIPLE
DRIVER COMPETITION" I signed the Patent Application and Assignment.
