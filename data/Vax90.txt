Users on MIKE may now submit Component Evaluation Requests on-line by typing
'CER' at the VAX system prompt ($).  The program will prompt for information
about the component, and forward the request to Component Engineering for
processing.  The user should be prepared to answer specific questions such
as Atari part number, vendor part number, vendor contact and phone numbers.
The program allows for several comment lines, in which the user may include
whatever information may be appropriate.  If additional information and/or
samples are required, the Component Engineer assigned to each request
will contact the requester if needed.  The user will be notified when the
CER has been completed, and the results of the evaluation. 

Users on BERT or ERNIE may also:

Subj:	Brainstorming -- Thursday -- 12:00 -- RSVP!


         This week's brainstorming session is the one you have all
         been waiting for!!! It is your chance to offer advice on how
         to:

              Improve the game development process
              Increase productivity
              Maximize creativity
              Make the work place more fun!

         Many of your ideas, generated during the '88 brainstorming
         season have been implemented:

              You asked to have the opportunity to see what other
              people are working on and to get feedback on what you
              are working on: Walkabout Friday.

              You felt like sometimes you put a lot of work into the
              Game Initiation packet, only to find that management did
              not agree with the direction you chose: Concept
              Approval prior to Initiation.

              You wanted to be able to dedicate someone to playing
              your game to look for bugs: Tengen and outside play-
              testers.

              You wanted more productive game reviews: Game playable
              in advance, review agendas.

              You wanted Marketing to be more involved throughout the
              whole project instead of just near the end: Weekly
              project meetings with Product Manager.

              You wanted RAM to simulate the graphics ROM for
              development: G1 has this feature.

              You wanted higher salaries, more vacation, and free
              lunches: Well, you can't have everything!!

         So RSVP to this VAX address by 9:00a.m. Wednesday (1/10) to
         sign up for this once-a-year opportunity!

         As usual, lunch will be provided in the luxurious Central
         Conference Room promptly at 12:00 noon, Thursday, 1/11/90.

         Thanks!!

Subj:	".ROM" files and MIXIT


  I am working with Dave Shepperd on some code which will eventually become a
portable mixit-style program (to run on VAX, UNIX, PCs, Ariums, or whatever).
In looking over the various flavors of files supported by mixit and the PROM
programmer utilities, the .ROM format stands out as a particularly arcane and
difficult to implement file type.  So I would like to know who is using .ROM
format, for what purpose, and which features of the format are being used.
Depending on the response, we may not implement .ROM format in the new program,
or we may only implement a subset of .ROM format functionality (DON'T PANIC:
the current VAX version of mixit would still be available for .ROM files).

  Please reply via VAXmail.  Your silence will be interpreted as "don't-care
bit" indicators.

	We are looking for a new name to be used for the updated version
of Hard Drivin'.  Currently we are using Hard Drivin' 90 but are looking for
something that does not date the game.

Some suggestions so far:
				Harder Drivin'
				20% Harder Drivin'
				Teen-aged Mutant Ninja Drivin'

You get the idea.

Also, we are looking for a logo or name for describing the link capability.

	Such as : 	
			Simu-link
			Linx
			

What ever.

Send any ideas to this address.

Subj:	Bug Enhancement Report (the first of many)


	With the recent upgrade of VMS, we got new features in almost
every utility that VMS has.  Some of you know about them from complaints
about out-of-date command tables (we're working on a better solution for
that).  At any rate, MAIL is no exception; it has new stuff (bugs or
features, you guess) too.

	Mail changed it's database quite a bit.  It now keeps track of
which printer you want (SET QUE TTxx, see the door of the printer room
for details), and you can choose your editor, and you may opt to be asked
for CC names or not.  All of this stuff gets saved when you exit mail
for the next time.  Except for Wordmarc users, you don't have to wrap
a command file around mail (MAIL$EDIT or MAIL$PRINT) in order to get it
to do what you want.  Go into mail and do a SHOW ALL to find out your
environment.  SET what you want different.

	Of course, it has a price.  In the process, it lost track of the
current message count for most accounts.  Read all your messages, and then
do a READ/NEW to A)display an error message and B)set the count to zero.

	Some time soon, we hope to let you know about some of the more
helpful changes.  Soon as we figure out if any are helpful...

	Watch this space for further details.

Re: Hard Drivin' (the Saturday Morning Cartoon Show)
Dt: 11 January 1990


Main Characters:

	John:  Race Car Driver in his late twenties;
	Terry: 	Teenage Boy, on the pit crew
	Jennifer: Teenage Girl, on the pit crew

The series takes place during summer vacation which is why the
teenagers are not in school.

The Hard Drivin' team goes around the country competing in auto races.

The auto races are not the focus of the show, but merely the backdrop
because the team has adventures and battle bad guys. Like drug dealers.
	
When things get really desperate John makes his way to an arcade with
a Hard Drivin' Cockpit Game. He gets in it, starts it up, and recites a 
magic phrase. 

The Hard Drivin' Game is transformed into a real, jet powered car which
John drives out through a wall of the arcade that has opened for him.

Every show is resolved this way. There are lots of arcades, so there can be
lots of ways for the Hard Drivin' car to make its exit.

Most of the time John will be the hero but sometimes Terry or Jennifer will
be the one. (It is especially important that Jennifer gets to do it, too.)

Subj:	Driver Sound Programmed Parts


I am have been meaning to ask you about it but I got caught in a time
crunch.

We are building more Drivers in March, so, because Production has a lot
of 27256s I changed the Driver Sound Board so it divides the Sound Wave Roms
in two banks which can be independently selected to be 27512s or 27256s. 

Bank 1 contains eight sockets and Bank 2 contains four sockets. This is
because the existing sound data takes four 27512s which will be replaced with 
eight 27256s. The Hard Drivin' upgrade kit will include additional ROMs

Subj:	RE: Driver Sound Programmed Parts


If we are to make a 256 version of the sound roms, then we will need to do
a formal release of these parts. I assume you have already selected the 
program part numbers for these new codes, (which is ok), what I need now is 
formal documentation and memory masters to complete the release. As an option
you can submit a CER just to add the part numbers to the AVL, for the parts
planners over in MFG and complete the release with memory masters at a later 
date. Let me know what you want to do.


                                                                 RLO

the field as well as the new boards.

The 27256s contain the same data as the 27512s in the last Rev only split
up. I have prepared documentation which I will give you tomorrow (Friday)

The other two parts are programmed GALs. I have a lot of questions about
how programmed GALS are released and bought (because we buy them programmed).

	Do we provide them with a programmed part or a computer file?

	What if we want the security fuse blown?

	Do they test the devices with our test vectors or do they generate
	their own? (Do they test them with anybody's test vectors?)

By the way, I have programmed the part's pn in the User Signature bits.
Unfortunately the Data I/O cannot read them except as fuses in ones and
zeros.

Subj:	Productivity


About your brainstorming memo.

The single largest factor in determining productivity is the
availability of tools.

I am talking VAXes and PCs.

Every second wasted waiting for the VAX to respond is irretrievably
lost, not to mention unproductive. The VAXs have been steadily getting 
slower until last week when they went down a whole notch. Even so,
there are still people running Makes and other processes on KIM that
could be run on one of the Batch VAXes. Running these processes on
KIM brings the system to its knees, so that even ordinary EDTs are impossible.

Until the issues of computers is addressed, the issues of creativity
are pretty much immaterial.

This is not a request to attend the meeting.

Thanks,

	If you are one of those who works with command files, including
your own login command file, you need to read DOK:UTL$.DOC .  This applies
particularly if you are the local guru (the one everybody asks "How come my
computer ...")  If you are one of those who asks the local guru, nevermind.

	If you don't know how to read the file, you don't need to, and won't
want to.  Its full of system stuff, and your guru will take care of you.

Subj:	Excuse me, did you say you needed tail?


Looking for tail? Seems like there's always a need for tail and the threshold
of pain has been getting lower for those of us who want it but can't get it,
so I did something about it.

If you are thinking what I think you are thinking, then think again.
I'm talking about the tail of a file. It's sometimes handy to look at the tail
end of a file, especially a .LOG file from a batch job in progress. Unix has
a nifty program called TAIL which does just that so I wrote a version for
VMS.

It copies the last n RECORDS of the specified input file to the specified output
file (defaulting to SYS$OUTPUT) making the output file attributes EXACTLY the
same as those of the input. Currently it only supports standard sequential
files, not indexed or relative (hardly anybody uses relative or indexed
files). All the record formats are supported except UDF (undefined).
The output file inherits the record attributes of the input file but they are
otherwise ignored. It can read a .LOG file while it is being created during
a batch job.

Login or RESTART to get the symbol, then type:

$ TAIL [/number] input_file [output_file]

where [] denotes optional data. The [/number] defaults to /23 so you can
get 1 screen's worth. The input_file is required and there are no defaults.
The output file defaults to SYS$OUTPUT (your terminal). Some examples:

	$ TAIL BATCH.LOG	!shows the last 23 lines of the .LOG file
	$ TAIL /100 BATCH.LOG	!shows the last 100 lines
	$ TAIL /1 FRED.EXE FOO.EXE !copies the last block of fred to foo

+12V at 6A

-5V at 0.5A

-12V at 0.5A


It would be useful to compare the cost for the above supply with the supply we

As you all know by now I'm leaving to have my baby, today is my last day.
Liane will be replacing me while I'm out.  Please be helpful by letting her
know who you are when you're answering a page, when you want her to page
someone for you make sure you give her the extension you're at.  I've noticed
that some of you aren't checking your dial tone for message waiting and your
messages are sitting up her for a long time.  Please remember if you've left
your office for any length of time to listen to your dial tone when you return,
I know it,s aggravating to check your phone everytime and never have a message,
but that's the way the new system works.
It would be helpful if you introduced yourself to Liane when you're passing
through the lobby. She's a pretty girl so I know some of you single guys will
be tempted to STAND AROUND and SMALL talk her ear off, (you know who you are)
but please don't.  We want her to have a comfortable stay here at Atari,
besides answering the phones will keep her busy enough.  (said with a smile!)
Thanks for your help and understanding see you in a couple of months.

like a combo of the Aliens and Gremlins movies.  She says it's not
a bad game but supposedly they will be pulling it after the weekend.

FINAL FIGHT:  New Capcom game, is also there and earning fairly well.
$329 this week placing it right behind the top 3 (Mutant Turtles,
Cyberball, Hard Drivin').  This game is supposedly doing well right

Subj:	Terminology survey


	Well, I'm confused, so I decided to turn to the august
community of erstwhile scholars we know as sys$mail:ee to answer
a question (or set of them). First a little background. When I
started working on ASAP, I needed names for data items of 8, 16,
and 32 bits. The first and last were relatively easy, 8 bits
was the minimum addressable unit, so it was a byte. 32 bits was
the size of all registers and the data bus so it was a word.
That means 16 bits would be a halfword. This was simple, self-
explanatory, and had historical precedent (IBM 360, PDP-10, etc).
I toyed with the idea of calling them char, short, and int, but
someone (I forget who) flamed me severely so I abandoned that
approach. So loading 16 bits was done with a LDH (sign extend)
or LDUH (zero-fill) while loading a whole machine word was LD.

	So far, so good. The fly in the ointment was that I was
assembling with a set of macros for MAC65, and .word generated
16-bit data while .long generated 32-bit data. I cobbled up a
version of MACAS to use .hword and .word respectively, but I
have never been _real_ happy with this and am getting less so.
When I ran the idea of reverting to the old definitions past
the two Eds, they agreed, but went on to say I should _also_
re-name the instructions. Under the proposed scheme we would have:

old		new		means
LD		LDL		load a 32-bit machine word
ST		STL		store a 32-bit machine word
LEA		LEAL		load the effective address of a 32-bit word
LDH		LDW		load a 16-bit halfword with sign extension
LDUH		LDUW		load a 16-bit halfword with zero-fill
STH		STW		store a 16-bit halfword
LEAH		LEAW		load the effective address of a 16-bit halfword
LDB		LDB		load an 8-bit byte with sign extension
LDUB		LDUB		load an 8-bit byte with zero-fill
STB		STB		store an 8-bit byte

	This leaves open the question of just what we should call the 32-bit
entity in comments, circuit diagrams, etc. It _is_ a word, but we have
pre-empted that (pardon the expression) word to mean something else. "long"
means something to C programmers, but not neccesarily to everyone. Also
there is the not-inconsiderable problem that my daughter's initials (LEA)
would no longer be a valid mnemonic :-). Other than then over-40 references
to words in the spec (and who knows how many in various programs) the proposed
scheme has merit, but I am still bothered. So I'd like each of you who cares

Subj:	GAME AWARDS


Atari Games has recently been recognized for the outstanding quality 
of games produced in the past year.  During the London ATE show, 
HARD DRIVIN' received the "Game of the Year" award from the British
trade association and Atari Games was given an engraved crystal bowl 
which will be presented to the Hard Drivin' design team.  

Then, at the German IMA show, the association nominated both HARD DRIVIN'
and TETRIS as "Best Video Game for 1989".  This was the first time two
games from the same company have ever shared this honor.  Our German
distributor, Nova, is often our #1 distributor in the world, and it is
quite rare that a manufacturer is congratulated to this degree.

On another front, one of the leading consumer video magazines, "Video Games
and Computer Entertainment" awarded four of our games for Best of 1989:

Hard Drivin'  - Best simulator 
Cyberball 2072 -  Best sports
Escape  - Most innovative
Stunrunner - Best arcade game

These awards will be published in the February issue, which has now 
been issued.  Our games were selected based on a poll of the editorial
staff at the magazine.  I received individual wall plaques for these
awards today and will arrange to have them prominently displayed in 
our lobby.  

Congratulations to all those who helped earned these terrific awards.  

Mary

Subj:	Oh no, more stuff for sale!!


	A number of people have asked me about a second phone line at their
house, some for computers, some for a business, and some for their kids.

	You'll need to decide if it applies to you, but I just got a Radio
Shack flyer that offers a two-line desk telephone for $40 (usually $60,
when they stock them).  You plug in one jack and buttons on the faceplate
let you select line 1 or line 2, and there is a HOLD feature.  It has last-
number-redial, and can be set for rotary or touch-tone dialing. In appearance,
it looks like our brown phones with extra buttons above the flash button.
Unlike ours, they will work on the public network (at your house).
They do not have the flash button, for those who buy those special services
(message waiting and the like).

	Yes, this is Radio Shack.  It is good enough to last out the warranty,
but then it is guaranteed to break.  On the other hand, a "good" one that
WILL last a long time runs around $150, and doesn't have as many features.
And yes, I'm thinking of getting one myself.

Subj:	ZMODEM, the second generation


Here's the latest scoop on ZMODEM transfers.  

1)	I changed the program to use 1024 instead of 64 byte blocks to
	transfer.  This should speed things up a bit.

2)	The problem with some files not transferring seems to stem from 
	the method used to upload the file to the VAX in the first place.
	I'm talking about .RAD files we tried as tests here.  If the file
	is uploaded using NFT COPY on the PC, the PC looks at the first 512
	bytes of the file, and if a carriage return is found, decides the
	file is a text file, and proceeds to transfer the file as text,
	creating a STREAM file on the VAX, which will cause ZMODEM to barf
	when trying to tranfer it.  If no CR is found, the file is
	created with fixed length records.  The sneaky thing here is that
	this error may or may not show up depending on the contents of the
	file.

	The way around this is to ALWAYS transfer BINARY files (like .RAD)
	to and from your PC using NFT COPY/BLOCK.  This forces the file into
	the correct form on the VAX.  Text files are OK to transfer without
	the /BLOCK option.

	If you have a file that won't transfer, a quick fix is to transfer
	it down to the PC via NFT COPY/BLOCK, then NFT COPY/BLOCK it back.
	This should fix the file so ZMODEM will work OK on it.


Let me know if you run into any other problems using SZ or RZ.

	PLEASE!

	DO NOT take your printouts from the middle of the pile without
taking care of the pile.  The baskets will only start to stack printouts
if they are empty.  They will continue to stack if you leave them alone
(and luck is with them) but you, yes you, personally guarantee that every
printout after the one you dig for will be mangled if you don't take
care of the whole pile.

	This still applies if yours is the last job.  If you can take the
time to find your job, then you have time to empty the basket.  If you
don't, it still dumps the following listings on the floor.

	I find it interesting to note that every time this happens, ALL
banner pages are removed which identify the culprit.  I have had it with
cleaning up the room after others;  since I can tell who the culprit is
by other means, I'll send them this annoying message for a few times, and
if that doesn't work, I'll let the public know.  None of this is new.

Subj:	NEC Spinwriter


I am guilty. Yesterday, I removed a listing from the Spinwriter and did not
remove, separate, and stack the couple of listings in the basket.

One reason for this is because I am frequently unsuccessful in separating the
paper without it tearing. I assume that people use the Spinwriter because
they are going to use the printout for something reasonably important. 

I am surprised to learn that the output from the Spinwriter is so volumious
that it spills out onto the floor.

I am puzzled by your reference to the header sheets being missing, thereby 
making it difficult for you to trace the culprit. I have never seen the
Spinwriter produce a header sheet. Are we both talking about the Spinwriter
in the Printer Room or have I been missing something?

I do observe proper printer etiquette regarding the Printronix printers.

As long as we are on the subject of the Printer Room, it would be nice to have 
a working terminal in the Printer Room or its vicinity, for those times when
something gets screwed up and I need to log on to get a listing. (My office is a
long way from the Printer Room.)

It would also be nice to add an additional terminal to the DIO Room so that both
the 288 and the 29 can be used at the same time.


Regards,

  Jed

Subj:	RE: NEC Spinwriter


	With reference to the header sheets, it is a stock message.
As you correctly infer, the problem applies more often to the Printronix
printers than it does to the spinwriter.  However, as you also point out,
anyone wanting printouts worthy of retention uses the spinwriter; unfortunately,
this includes printouts of online documentation, and quite a few people use
it for printing mail message, status reports, and general memos.  It does
indeed spill out onto the floor.

	It would cure the stacking problem if you would simply remove the
detritus from the basket and put it on the shelves.  It is assumed that
when people pick up their listings, they check for a complete listing.
Finding an appendix, it would only be reasonable to assume they would remove
the others' listings from their own, and leave them for the others involved.

	The reason I sent the message (the reason I send it every time I do so)
is because there were enough printouts following the missing one to cause
problems.  Admittedly, this is contrary to general supposition (nobody thinks
we use that printer, but we go through more supplies for that one than
both printronix combined.

	With regards to a terminal in the printer room, there is one.  It is
usually powered off because it has a problem with overheating.  It is across
from the Spinwriter.

	With regards to another terminal in the Data I/O room, there are already
two in place.  We have eight ports tied up with the current configuration, 
because we have to provide DIO support when either Kim or Charm is down; four
ports are present for each system.  In order to add a terminal to control the
other DIO at the same time would require the addition of four more ports (a
terminal and a device port on each of two systems).  We don't have the wiring,
the free ports, or any working terminals to support this, and we also lack
the space to put the equipment if we did.  Lastly, the usage is highly sporadic.
The 29 can go for a week without any usage, and then the biggest obstacle to
getting it is other people using it, not the 288.  If you find a problem using 
the 29 because of 288 users, you might point out to them that there is another
288 near Ed Logg's lab, with an associated terminal.

Since you want me to handle Spinwriter listings already in the basket on
those few times I use the Spinwriter, then fine, I will be happy to.

Since you don't want to put in a separate terminal in the DIO Room for the
29, then fine, I will handle being frustrated when I come to use it and
find it the 288 occupied by somebody whose ROMs are done but they are nowhere
to be found. 

BUT, don't tell me the terminal in the Printer Room is functional, because it
is NOT. Yesterday, I tried to use it; the screen is too dim. And even when it
was working, it didn't work properly.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plus you have to add to and change a couple of things in your TMS320.MAC file:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
         New		         |         Old
-------------------------------- 80 -----------------------------------------
        .psect TICODE            |          .=0                              
	.globl TMSCODE           |
TMSBEGIN:                        |                                           
-------------------------------- 88 -----------------------------------------
        .=TMSBEGIN+10            |          .=10                             
-------------------------------- 94 -----------------------------------------
        .=TMSBEGIN+30            |          .=30                             
-------------------------------- 1168 ---------------------------------------
TMSEND == .-TMSBEGIN             |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then you can LLF the TMS320.OB file with your 68000 code directly BUT you
will need to include it in an options file:

TMS320.OPT:
	FILE (TMS320.OB additional_68k_files_to_link ...)
	LOCATE (TICODE_ : 0x0000 TO 0x3FFF OUTPUT 0x????)
	DECLARE (TMSCODE 0x????)

where the ???? is the address in 68k address space where you want the
TMS320 code to reside. (NOTE that the section name is TICODE_ with
a trailing underscore, even though the .psect name in the .MAC file
doesn't have a trailing underscore). The global symbol TMSCODE is
set in the options file by the DECLARE directive and TMSEND is set
by the assembler.

.END is only advisory (it's a comment as far as the assembler is concerned)
except if there's a label on it in which case the label is read to be the

0x is another way of specifying hex (it's the C syntax for hexidecimal).
The 0 to 3FFF is to locate the TMS320 program in TMS320 address space (0-3FFF
or whatever) and the OUTPUT is to locate that block of code into the
68000's address space. LLF won't do what you want directly, I'll have to
figure something out. In the meantime, you can put the TMS320 code somewhere
in the 68000's address space that doesn't conflict with the 68000's program.

You might make your option file (DSOUND.LC) look like:

	FILE (DSOUND STUB TMS320.OB)
	locate(PROGRAM : #1000 TO 7FFF);
	locate(VECTORS : #0000);
	locate($$seg14 : #0FFC000 TO #0FFCFFF );
	LOCATE (TICODE_ : 0x0000 TO 0x3FFF OUTPUT 0x8000)
	DECLARE (TMSCODE 0x8000)

Change the 7FFF and 8000 to whatever is appropriate (wherever there is
room for the TMS code). Then you link it with:

$ LLF dsound.lc/opt/sym/map
$ EXIT

To fix this (or at least make LLF shut up about it), you'll need to make
a small change to TMS320.MAC:

Subj:	GreenHills Structure padding


	In the process of defining some offsets in an assembly
program to reference a structure in 'C', I did a little experiment
and was (a bit) surprised. You may be aware of the padding needed
when a structure contains elements larger than a byte. What you
may not be aware of is that GreenHills (by default) applies that
padding even to structures that do _not_ contain any elements
larger than a byte. That is, the following C:

struct three_byte {
	char a;
	char b;
	char c;
} foo[2] = { {1,2,3},{4,5,6} };

will normally produce the following assembly:

foo:	DC.B	1
	DC.B	2
	DC.B	3
	DCB.B	1,0		; <- note bogus padding byte
	DC.B	4
	DC.B	5
	DC.B	6
	DCB.B	1,0		; <- Yep, another one

This has the dual disadvantage of complicating structure passing to
GNU CC (which only pads if it should), and increasing the size of your
data tables for no good reason.

	Fortunately, I have since discovered that -x132 will tell the
compiler not to do that. Now all I need to do is change my definition of
ncc and re-compile all my sources that reference structures with only char
elements.  Oh well, the devil finds work for idle hands. In case you are
interested, I do not (offhand) know of any "US" routines that would be
broken by this.

Subj:	RE: It broke


The .TEST is an assembler directive that instructs LLF to check the value
of an expression and print the accompanying error message if the test is
true.

The TMS320.INC file has a .TEST directive in the OOP (One Operand Instruction)
primative which checks that the value of the one operand is less than 128.
The assembler doesn't flag the error because I had you put the ram variables
in a relocatable .PSECT so you wouldn't get the LLF warning about overlapping
sections and therefore it doesn't know what the value of the variables are
until link time. Until I can figure out a way around this, you'll either have
to live with an LLF warning or not finding out about ram "out of range" until
link time.

There is another bug, however, since LLF is also supposed to give you the
line number in the source file where the .TEST directive was given. Damn.

Subj:	Possible EEPROM problem


SOFTWARE TYPES:
There is a race condition involving the EEPROM unlock circuit. This can be
cured with a very simple software change. See your hardware guy to see if this
is a problem with your hardware. 

HARDWARE TYPES:
A typical EEPROM lock circuit is shown below:

      /UNLOCK ____                                    
                 |                                
             +---o---+                           
             |   S   |                             
       GND --|D     Q|---- /OE                               
             |       |                             
             |       |                             
       /WL --|>      |                               
             |       |                             
             +-------+                           

The problem is that /UNLOCK and /WL occur at the same time, plus or minus a
gate delay or two. If the path for /WL is slightly slower, the EEPROM will not
get unlocked. The solution is to do the unlock with a byte write to the high
byte only. This suppresses /WL and the problem goes away.

The supply we need must be in an AT compatible case and have the following

+5V at 18A

+12V at 6A

-5V at 0.5A	(I told Rick Meyette that 0.3A is ok)

-12V at 0.5A	(I told Rick Meyette that 0.3A is ok)


It would be useful to compare the cost for the above supply with the supply we 
are using in our prototype which has:

+5V at 22A

+12V at 8A

-5V at 0.5A

-12V at 0.5A

A dentist friend of mine contacted me and says he's interested in using
computers to teach young children about good dental habits.  He wants to
design a game that is fun to play, but also would instruct the kids how
to brush correctly (don't forget to floss!).  He said he heard of an old
game written by someone at Atari called "Plaque Wars" or "Plak Wars" or
something just as original.  I seem to recall hearing about this, but I
just can't place it.  It was probably written for the old 800 computer.
If you know ANYTHING about this program, I would appreciate the information,
and it's for a good cause!

Channel 44 - 8 pm:"At Close Range" with Christopher Walken and Sean Penn.
                   The elder of the two plays a crazed criminal that
                   his boys to follow him into his line of work. The film

It's going to be a cold rainy yuchy evening. Maybe the best thing to do 
is just put on your fez and slippers, hop on the sofa, and follow
this line-up:

1. First, check out the photo on page 1 of the San Jose Merc; George
   Bush doing his Jimmy Swaggert impersonation.

2. Watch the tape of the movie that you didn't watch last night.

3. Invite all your campy friends over, gather up all your unused
   coathangers, and watch "Mommie Dearest" on channel 44 @ 8 pm.

4. Then quickly switch channels to channel 9 and watch Sidney Poitier
   and Shelley Winters in "A Patch of Blue". Shelley Winters plays
   mommie dearest to a blind girl, who in 1965, can't see that
   Sidney is black and that anything is wrong with him befriending
   her. It is a heartwarming tale and Shelley Winters is meaner than
   Joan Crawford could ever be. Sidney Poitier is great, as always.
   The movie starts at 10:30.

Tom,

	We just received a copy of the bug list for the F32 and F33 versions.
In the process of fixing the bugs in the F32 they introduced new bugs in
the F33. We can live with the bugs in the F32. We cannot live with the bugs
in the F33. 

	The entry in the AVL is for the F33. Please change it to call out
the F32.

Subj:	printer problems, and temporary solution


	The printer known as MKT$PRINT (near James O'Hara's office) is
broken.  I've arranged for most stuff that would go there to go to
RAINS$PRINT (in the old PPS equipment room, across from the animators),
which is a similar type of printer.  If you need help finding it,
Dennis Nale is posting a map on the old printer.  When it is fixed,
things will quietly revert to the way they were before.  If you have
problems sending stuff (it doesn't come out at all), see me, and
we'll come up with a workaround for that application.

Subj:	What now?


Well, they've left...  

We feel either sad because they are gone, or guilty for staying behind and not
volunteering instead.  I'm sure most of them will do just fine (or perhaps
better) out there in the 'real world'.

But now we should start thinking of the future and how to turn this company
around.  I'm not much for sending out messages but I am one for asking for ideas
and contributions from people.  I personally feel that the ones receiving this
message are the salvation of this company.  We need to start planning for the
future and this forum seems to be a good place to start.

I suppose it would do no good to complain about the past and the lack of
cooperation from upper management (complaining has never worked in the past). 
But, I'm going to jump on my soapbox for the remainder of this paragraph:
Through the years I've heard at almost every 'large' meeting complaints about
the lack of communication from management to the masses.   Complaints about the
absence of an explanation of what our company's strategic plan is (or if there
really is one!).  I've never heard an explanation, and I bet that when we meet
again we still won't hear one.
How can we work for the common good if we don't know what the common good is?

I admit that they have a VERY tough job.  And, we are somewhat at the mercy of
the volatile industry we're in.  And, I also admit that engineering management
has made great strides in developing good constructive methods to help in the
creation of products (we've seen better brainstorming meetings,  the start of
concept approval meetings, pitch sessions -- I think that Rich Moore, Chris
Downend and John Ray really care about us and the company).  These changes have
made projects run smoother and we really produce a better product.
I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of general direction and explanation
of our stragetic plans.

[stepping off of soapbox]


Yeah, I guess I'm sticking my neck out a bit since I'm one of the managers
(but lower management... LOWER!).  It would seem that I should keep my mouth
shut and go with the flow.  But, I can't.  I feel that we all should be heard.
We all should have a say in where OUR company is going.  

So, I'm soliciting ideas, comments and anything that you feel would contribute
to help our situation.  Several ideas have been talked about in the past but
never really considered by management (trying out other markets, creating new
ones, there's more but I won't list them here -- we have a lot of creative 
people in this company!).  We can revisit those ideas and/or any other topic you
wish to discuss.  All I ask is that you stay lite on complaints and heavy on
suggestions AND that you send your messages to '@sys$mail:ee'  and not to me. 
Remember: be constructive.  I tend to agree that complaining about an issue is
of no use unless it's done in a constructive manner (for instance, if you
complain about an item, let's hear your ideas for improvement).

Lastly I'll leave you with this long quote from Charles Swindoll's "Growing 
Strong in the Seasons of Life":

"
	Edward Roy had a problem.  Earthy, but not earth-shattering.  Not very
enjoable to talk about at dinner either, but big enough to make the man 
struggle through a few sleepless nights.

	He ran a lowly business - JIFFY JOHN of Pompano Beach, Florida.  Five
hundred portable toilets for rent.  Band concerts, construction sites, church
picnics, outdoor gatherings of any size could rent his product.  But that
wasn't Ed's problem.  As expected, when he started his business in 1982, lots 
of folks in Florida needed a place to be alone when they were caught out in 
the open.  Rentals were up.  That was good and bad.

	Now he had to figure out what to do with all the sewage... that was
the problem.  Many a man would've thrown his hands in the air in exasperation
and spent half his profit to have somebody haul off his product's product.
Not Ed.  There had to be a better way.

	In his search for a solution, he found a solar-heating process that
turned sewage into fertilizer.  Then came a masterstroke of marketing: 
instead of trying to sell the technology directly to local Florida communities,
his company expanded and began to operate three $3 million plants itself.
Under this new arrangement, the company would treat sewage for a fee and
convert it into fertilizer, which was, in turn, sold for a substantial
profit.  A limited partnership soon produced the cash - the JIFFY INDUSTRIES,
INC. provided a good tax shelter.  I suppose we could say Edward Roy literally
turned his problem into a project.

	And what a project!  Jiffy stock turned in the year's best 
performance on any American exchange, rising from 92 cents a share to a
whopping $16.50 - a spectacular 1,693 percent gain.  Newsweek magazine 
recently reported that "with dozens of states suffering from a surfeit of
sewage... Jiffy's 'Anaerobic Digester' is catching on everywhere."  ....

	Gross though it may seem, I doubt that I'll ever forget the problem
Edward Roy had with his johns.  He simply refused to let all that stuff get
the best of him.  What a lesson for all of us!

	Life is difficult... really very little more than an endless series of
problems.  Do we want to moan and groan about them or face them?  Do we want
to teach the next generation the disciplines involved in accepting and
solving them or encourage them to run and hide from them?

	I appreciate and agree with Scott Peck, M.D., who wrote:

	... it is in this whole process of meeting and solving
	problems that life has meaning.  Problems are the cutting
	edge that distinguishes between success and failure.
	Problems call forth our courage and our wisdom.  It is only
	because of problems that we grow mentally and spiritually....
	It is through the pain of confronting and resolving problems
	that we learn.  As Benjamin Franklin said,

	"Those things that hurt, instruct."

Subj:	DUPLICATE PLCC PART NUMBERS


We are presently carrying three part numbers for PLCC sockets. they are 
P/N 179252-XXX, 179250-XXX and 179237-XXX. Only, part number 179237-XXX shows
any WHERE-USED, while, part numbers 179237-XXX and 179252-XXX shows any stock.

I would like to inactivate for new designs part numbers 179250-XXX and 179252
-XXX. This would require that the stock for part number 179252-084 be sold off
or exchanged for credit. this stock is from 3M/TEXTOOL and needs a special tool
to remove the PLCC from the socket (Note: the sources for part number 179237 all
use the same tool and 3M/TEXTOOL is changing over to the same style socket). We
presently have 1250 pieces in stock of the 84 pin socket. If we want to use them
we can, but remember they need a special tool.

On part number 179252; I believe that this was established for SHOWVIEW and only
called out the AMP sockets. After Geoff Barker and I ran shock tests for Morgan,
it was determined that other manufactures could be used in his application. I
would add AMP to part number 179237-XXX.

If everyone is in agreement, I would like to do this, this week. Any questions,
please feel free to contact me.

Subj:	A PROPOSAL FOR AN "ATARI EQUIPMENT ADVANTAGE PLAN"


This is just off the top of my head (what a mess) but just to 
stimulate some discussion here goes. What if the company gave every 
engineer/programmer/animator an official capital equipment
budget of say 5% of their base salary. This money could be 
spent on any equipment (within reason) that the person felt
would aid them in achieving the goal of 25% more efficiency.
The amount of paperwork to justify/wheadle/cajole this would
be kept to an absolute minimum.
	people would be allowed to combine their allocations
to make bigger group purchases. They would be allowed to carry
over some percentage of the unused money into subsequent
years. 
	To assuage management fears of frivolous purchases
perhaps people could be allowed to trade in their allocations
for 20 cents on the dollar if they chose at the end of the 
fiscal year, reducing the incentive to squander.
	Finally, I bet some programmers and engineers would
avail themselves of a feature where the company would match
employee contriutions to the "plan" at a 3 to 1 rate for those
"extra needs".
	
	I know that a vast majority of the people seeing
this message would spend their allocation wisely and to
the immense benefit of the company. I also feel that additional
benefits such as employee admiration for managements 
enlightened attitude and the sense of being trusted and
treated as professionals would accrue.
	
	
	SO THERE. WHAT DO UUUU THINK?

The plan sounds very enticing, but I think we need some set of metrics
which can be used to determine whether or not we are working 25% more
efficiently as a result.  How do we tell if it worked?

For alternate sources to the TI TMS27C010-170 I suggest you start with parts
that have the same pinout. 

There are three different style pinouts and I have chosen the one embodied by 
the 27C010 because it is compatible with 27C512s with minor addressing changes.

I CHAECKED A THIRD TIME AND ALL OF THESE VENDORS ARE PIN COMPATIBLE WITH
TI'S PART. ALSO, THEY HAVE SPEEDS OF 170NS OR FASTER.

I WILL DOUBLE CHECK ON THE COMPATIBLITY TO THE 512'S, BUT IT IS MY BELIEF THAT
THEY ARE, BUT HAVE ONLY THE MINOR ADDRESSING CHANGES NEEDED TO MAKE IT A 1MEG.

Subj:	Atari Advantage program


While we are dreamin' (I mean really dreamin here), I think that the
equipment budget should be by department, with the manager/supervisor
making the decision on where to spend the money for the group based on
input from individuals. This protects sensitive information, gives
mid-level managers some clout, and allows easier pooling for large 
purchases.

5% is way to low. Starting with a $40K annual salary (some make more, some make
less), 5% yields  $2k per year per person. For my group, I need to buy an
Arium for each programmer at about $15k each (Ariums have quick downloads and
offer source-level de-bugging; both improve productivity considerably). I need
to buy 2-3 Mac's at about $6k each, and I need some new scopes (2-3K each) and
a good logic analyzer for the 68000 at maybe $20k. So about $150K in round
numbers would do it. Spreading that over 3 years, for $50k per year means I
need more like 10% of the salaries for my group. 

Now we can all dream more accurately.

Subj:	ATARI $$$ $ expenditures


  While alot of you are trying to come up with an equipment advantage 
plan, and call it "DREEM'N "  or just pushing to become more ( %25 )
efficient,  I'm wondering about why $150 k is considered to be TOO 
LARGE an amount for finance to cough-up to fund our equipment needs.!??? 

  Also, something else that's been bothering me for some time now is how
ATARI and TENGEN can afford to provide our EXECs with luxury ( 560 SLs )
automobiles while they have a difficult time funding our essential 
equipment needs.  I may be out of line on this one since I don't know for
a fact that who pays for their Mercedeses and BMWs, but one would wonder
about such lucrative accomodations.

  During early 80s, when CHRYSLER corporation was going through hard times 
LEE IOCOCA made a promise to the american public that he would turn things
around and pay back the money we loaned his company.  He did all that for
an anual salary of $1 .

Some of the parts on the sheets you gave me were not compatible with the 27C010.

Also, I don't understand why you think you have to check into the compatability
with 27512s.

The 27C010 has a particular pinout. Don't lump the part in with any other
part with a different pinout.

If you do, and we buy them, they won't work on my board, which I designed for
27C010s.

Subj:	RADMOD has moved


I have moved RADMOD.EXE to utl$exe:.  You may have to change your login.com
to deal with this.  The line from your login.com should now look similar to
this:

	$ RADMOD :== $ UTL$EXE:RADMOD.EXE

Instead of something like this:

	$ RADMOD :== $ EE$USERDISK:[THEURER.PPS]RADMOD.EXE

If you have a special version of RADMOD that you've been using, let me know
so I can restore it where you can find it.  I noticed ones called RADMODBLOOD,
RADMOD2, RADMOD3 and a few other versions, but don't know if they are current
or experimental versions.

Ed Logg asked me about the other Theurer programs, such as TEK, VPIF,
PBROTATE, PBREPLICATE.  


	TEK is now in UTL$EXE:
	VPIF is now in UTL$EXE:

	PBROTATE   	-- correct me if I'm wrong, but these are obsolete
	PBREPLICATE

I found PBREPLICATE in [theurer.pps.OBS] and couldn't even find PBROTATE.

If these are truly not obsolete, let me know and I will move them to utl$PPS:

Also, any other tools Dave has that you use should be moved out of his 
directory and into the UTL directories.  He has a huge collection of .EXE files
that I'm not even going to guess what they're for, so if you have some you use
tell me and I'll save them from eventual disappearance from the VAX.

Subj:	DS II PCBs


Rick;

	I would like to make a request to get 2 DSII PCBs installed on my
development stations before April 7.  I would also like to get two RAM PCBs
to go with them.  I am expecting a considerable amount of graphics soon and
I want to download them rather than burn EPROMs.  I am willing to live with 
no audio for several months.  When can I get these?

	I have asked Max to install the fast background which has never been
installed on Stun Hardware with 288 lines.  At the same time he was to install
the new No-Lag code.  I hope this does not cause any delays in his schedule.

	I have also asked Eric to correct one of the feedback joystick PCBs.
It drifts to the left.

	Do you know any experienced helicopter pilots or instructors?  Rob Rowe
knows a test pilot at NASA but I would like a local second source to ask
questions on handling and especially the feedback aspects.

						Thanks

Subj:	COMPETITOR INFO


The latest issue of RePlay reveals even more new product info for ACME.
(Anne Hayes distributed a recap of other known competitor products
which was circulated to all ACME attendees this week.)

-Fabtek has "Sports Match" which is Tetris, but the tiles are sports-
 related.  ????

-Leland has a 3-player game called Pig Out which gives some indication
 of game play...

-Grand Products will debut a new tavern piece called Slick Shot which
 combines a mini pool table with video game play.

-Meltec has a new redemption called Lunar Golf which is supposedly 
 doing well.

Sega also has a new 3-player dedicated driving piece called Rough Racer
which is likely to be at ACME.  

This was rumored to be a very low-key show but it now appears that there
will be an abundance of new products.

I have finished documenting and collecting feedback from the

encourage you to read the document [ray]bsprod.doc. I have them 
posted on my bulletin board -- feel free to copy them or mark
them with  YOUR comments. Or, send me mail with your comments. I
have also  given Rich and Chris hard copies. 

I will refer to these ideas as I  have spare time to tackle
those areas I can contribute to. I hope others will too.

Thank you to all of you who contributed these ideas!!

Jed;

	This morning my development system died.  I found that I cannot read
my self test EPROMs.  The starting PC and SP are incorrect and change depending
on the time of day.  I wonder if there is a bus conflict with the new RAM PCB?

	I will try checking the self test EPROMs, but I will need someone to
look at this since Eric is gone.

						Thanks

Deviation Authorization NO. 939 was completed without component engineerings
signature. As it turned out, part number 37-82S123 was inactivated back in
Oct 1988. These parts could have a quality problem, due to storage conditions.
If it is not too late, I suggest that these parts be tested prior to being
programmed, or preferably, not used at all!

Subj:	Atari Hall of Fame

         I am PROUD to be an ATARIAN!! I am proud that for more than a
         decade we have consistently designed the most innovative
         games in the world!! If you are also proud, and would like to
         share this pride with others, then read on....

         At one of the recent brainstorming sessions, we discussed
         turning the Berlin Hall into the "Atari Hall of Fame". The
         intention is to put up posters, graphics, plaques, sell-
         sheets, etc. to display all of the games we have taken to
         production. We would also have a list of the people who
         worked on them.

         If you would like to help make this happen, then please RSVP
         to this VAXaddress. We need more ideas and volunteers to help
         organize this expression of our pride. In a week or so, I
         will schedule a lunchtime get-together (with those who reply)
         to discuss this plan further.

         Thanks!!

         John

         P.S. Thanks to John Salwitz for suggesting this!

Subj:	Noname support request for Applied Research


Rick,

Here is my formal request list for your groups support for Ed Logg's
helicopter game.  These requests may or may not overlap what Ed L. has
requested from you already.

1) We need to either have a modified version of Max's universe CAD ->
sector matrix conversion program, or access to said source so that I can
modify it myself.  I have spoken to Max and he is aware of the changes
that we need which will support the wrap arounds scheme that we are
planning to use.

2) We need a driver board modified for use as a universe cad tool.  The
modifications can be done by Farrohk, but appropriate documentation will
be necessary.  Also, since our object database is still very much in flux,
a ram based system (as opposed to ROM) is highly desireable.  Do we have
Farrohk MTO this board set, or will you handle it?

3) One situation that continually arose during the development of S.T.U.N.
Runner was that I would implement something, that you folks could use, or
Max or Steph would implement something that would be very useful to us
in our project.  Alas, even though we often saw each other daily, informing
each other of these new features & improvements did not happen in any
orderly fashion.  This was especially apparent at the end of the STUN when
Max came over and added a whole bunch of error detection code to the
system based upon changes that had been accumulated in teh Driver code
over the time period after which we first go the system code from Applied.

Now there are at least 3 projects using the same basic system.  I propose
that we meet to discuss ways in which this exchange of information can
be made in a timely yet painless fashion, especially since none of the
projects share any actual source files.  This could go a long way towards
speeding up development for all projects concerned.

	- Ed Rotberg -

Subj:	New Sega game at Milpitas Golfland -- "Columns"


Columns appears to be a test game at Milpitas Golfland. It is 
in Sega's metal "Aero City" cabinet (like the one we got from 
them when we were looking at their Tetris).

It is somewhat like a Tetris/KLAX combination -- things falling
from the top of  the screen, you guide them into holes in the
bottom of the  screen. Nice music, 2 independent, simultaneous
players. All  shapes falling (one at a time -- you can see the
next piece)  are three blocks tall, with a jewel in each block.
The jewels  are different colors -- you try to get three of the
same color  in a row -- vertically, horizontally, or diagonally
(sound  familiar?).  When you get three (or more) in a row, they 
disappear. You can get some neat chain reactions (I didn't try 
for the "Big X").  It gets faster and faster until the shapes 
reach the top of the screen -- Game Over (like Tetris).

They also had Bloxeed, a version of Tetris with special shapes 
(16ton, bomb, etc.) and 2 player competitive (if you get more 
than one line at a time, it sends the lines to your opponent).

Sega did their normal first class job implementing both games. 
I did not play them long enough to form a longevity opinion.

John

		  PARTY, PARTY, PARTY.... YEAH!
	
	In case you haven't noticed we have fallen behind in
our customary celebrations of completed games. So it is time to 
play catch-up and have one big party for all of them.
	   
	    The games this party is to cover are :

        Vindicators, Tetris, Escape, Skull and Crossbones
       Stunrunner and Cyberball 2 (or whatever it was called)
	
( KLAX and Badlands will be saved for more party enjoyment later!)

	The party is a celebration of all the Atari Games employees, 
who have worked deligently to see that we produce the best products 
possible. It also will give everyone here the opportunity to meet
some new faces and get reaquainted with some "oldtimers."

	Since we will have to get a lot of partying in all at once the
Executive Committee has been nice enough to let us all leave early next
Friday March 30th to get down this piece of business we have let slip 
for so long.  But you must get all of your Reviews and Fieldtests 
scheduled that day taken care of before you leave. Let's not abuse 
this expensive favor. 

	Sooo.. Be there on 

		  Friday March 30th at 2:30 pm 'til dark.
			         at
	 The BIG, TOO MANY GAMES TO NAME, ATARI BAR-b-QUE Party 
    				 in 
      ED LEVIN PARK (the one at the end of Calavares in Milpitas)
 	            at the SPIRNG VALLEY campsite. 
	(Maps will be posted at the coffee stations next week.)
	 
      Food, Beverages, Horseshoes and Volleyball will be provided.
         All other party devices like Frisbees, Aerobies, Softballs 
    		  and Waterballoons will be welcomed.

	   ( Execs say we must leave no sooner than 2:00 pm.)

				BE THERE!

Subj:	Get Centered!


If you use hall effect controls or pots in your video game, read on...

How many of you programmers use the dreaded POTS.C routines?  Well, I have a
little goodie for you.  Late one night, Andy and I were wrestling with some
controller problems.  It seemed we could not get the "automatic" centering
to work.  In fact, the actual centering code was never executed.  We finally
found this bug that I am sure is in some production games, don't let it be
in yours!

	FIND THIS STATMENT:

	pots_midtmr[ bank ] = -1;		/* count down in seconds */

	CHANGE IT TO THIS:

	pots_midtmr[ bank ] -= 1;		/* count down in seconds */

If you have this bug, it continually reset a countdown timer to minus 1 and
NEVER takes the branch to the mid adjustment routine.  Nifty, huh?

Subj:	Introducing AVLNOTES


Many users have asked for a way to get supplemental information on Atari parts
and components via their terminals.  Introducing AVLNOTES, a VMS help library.
It works just like the VMS HELP library your accustomed to, but with new topics.
At the "Topic >" prompt, you enter an Atari part number.  As in any VMS help
library, a question mark (?) will cause a list of available topics to be
displayed, or you can type HELP for more detailed instructions. 

There are two (2) methods of accessing AVLNOTES.

1) No need to login to some obscure node, AVLNOTES will work from anywhere on
our network!  Just type:   
                            @AVLNOTE:AVLNOTES

At the system prompt ($).  You can define a word in your LOGIN.COM file to
do this for you, such as:

                      AVLN*OTES :==@AVLNOTE:AVLNOTES

2) On node MIKE, users of AVL will receive AVLNOTES whenever 'Display by Atari
Part Number' is selected and the Atari part number searched for has a
corresponding AVLNOTES entry.  Users of ATARI$AVL:SEEAVL will receive AVLNOTES
whenever a corresponding AVLNOTES entry exists.
  

AVLNOTES only has a few entries at this time, but we're adding to it almost
daily.  If you wish to have a note added to any Atari part number, send your
proposed note via EMAIL to anyone in Components Engineering (MEYETTE, CLARK,
OWENS or BELL).

  Pat has asked me to look after the maintenance of lab tools/equipment.

So I'm asking all you techs. and EEs to help me with this. I need to 

know for starters about any and all soldering stations which are extra

or out of order so that I can fix, or throw them out and buy new ones.

If any of you engineers have stuff around your office (like soldering

irons, scopes, or meters) and you hardly ever use them, please come

forward and share them with the rest of us.  

  Drobny says we need to have a backpack that holds our scopes, meters

and... so that no one can e can count on having the equipments when we need them
                          steel our tools from our benches and we can 

count on having the right tool when we're called up to do a job.

  But carrying around all that stuff could break a techs. back. Instead

I ask all you engineers/hackers/technical know it all/others, to simply

remember that around here there are only a few technicians and we usually

do a good job of keeping our tools in order but rather than becoming 

possessive with our tools (like a previous tech) we would rather if others 

respected the following:

	1_ Tools belong to the LABS, they aren't much use to anyone


	   when stashed away where no one can find them.

	

	2_ If you want us techs to fix your stuff, don't borrow our


	   stuff without asking, or at least leave a note and remember


	   to bring the stuff back when you're done. We don't like to

	
           have to go looking for our tools.


	
  My older brother's a programmer and all my life I've had to protect
my tools from his abuse. I sure hope I won't have the same problem at
work too!

I patronized the cafeteria regularly until about two or three years ago
when they were infested by ants and showed no interest in getting rid
of the little buggers. I have not eaten there since then.

I do occasionally purchase soft drinks from the machine in the front of
the building. Unfortunately, the selections can be empty for days at a
time. I avoid drinks with caffeine and the machine up front is the only one
stocked with Sprite. None of the machines are stocked with 7-UP.

I don't particularly mind Farrokh's menu messages. For worse are the insipid
mesages concerning the Atari Survivor's Baseball Team. Since both of these
have taken the form of continuing operations I suggest that mail distribution
lists be created for those interested in receiving mail of that nature.

I don't know Rick Thompson decided that MOST of the rest of us don't like 
the Tues and Thurs specials, but he sure didn't ask me.  I'm happy to try
something different instead of that ol' burger a day.  So far, I've only 
been able to try the Iranian special a few times, and it has been good each
time.  

Usually, when I get to the lunch room (about 12:30), the Iranian special is 
all gone.  SOMEBODY must be eating it or it wouldn't sell.  I'm sure Rick
doesn't like it, but that doesn't mean we all hate it.

Perhaps you should get out more if the lunch special offends you.  They do
have other items on the menu, and there is a whole range of food in the general
vicinity.

For those of you interested in trying to figure out what the children

I have placed it in the Animator viewing cubicle for those of you
who wish to see it.  I will be returning it this evening so please

Does anybody in VAXland know of a good, CHEAP gardener who works around the
Los Altos/Sunnyvale area?  I don't need anything fancy, just a small field of
weeds mowed and some trimming.  I got a bid over the weekend for $200!  Is
this reasonable?  If you know anybody (an enterprizing young person, perhaps)
who will do this cheaper, please let me know via this VAX address.

								Thanks!

    Are you planning your summer vacation?  Are you looking for
something new and adventurous?

    Earthwatch is a non-political, non-profit organization which 
organizes volunteers to work with scientists on expeditions in 60
countries around the world, including many expeditions in the United
States.  You can go for a week or a month, or however much time you
have.  For example, you could help research volcanoes in Costa Rica or
help rescue Cape Cod's marine life.  You could work with
archaeologists unearthing tombs in Egypt or with an Australian ecologist
who needs help collecting data on Kangaroo Island's plants.  If you have
mountain climbing skills, you could help a Wyoming mammologist take a
Big Horn census in the Rockies.  You could observe porpoises from a 
dinghy off the coast of Hawaii.  This is just a small sample.  There are
many, many more.

Your transportation to and from expeditions, all membership costs,
and all expedition costs are 100% tax deductible.  For information
write Earthwatch at 680 Mt. Auburn Street, P.O. Box 403, Watertown,
MA 02272.

DIO alert !
We tried to upload an AMD 27c512 at the Data I/O 288 programmer.
What we got was a destroyed device.
When the Data I/O did auto F/P selection it got FF/FF. The correct F/P 
code is DD/A4. When we attempted to do the upload the device was 
destroyed. Later we did a "LOAD FROM MASTER" on another AMD 27c512 and that
worked ok.

I called DATA I/O and they said that they are investigating a problem with
AMD 27c512 parts and 288 version 4.1 The engineer is going to call me back 
with further details. He had not heard of destroying devices.

Our spool of custom 3-conductor ultra-flex cable is missing! The entire
future of the company is hinged upon the return of the precious wire
this morning. We must have it to build Gumball games.

In the past people would come and take a handful of terminals or a
length of wire, but it seems now the rage is to take the entire
bin of parts, or the entire spool of cable. 

This is not acceptable.

Please get up from your chair and return it right now.

My apologies to the people this message doesn't pertain to........

The missing cable has not been recovered, however, we have discovered
the the cable strippers that are adjusted to precisely strip the very
delicate cable are also missing.

We would just like to commend the scum-sucking-dog who took our cable
for having the good taste to take the right tool for the job. 

Please be aware that you should just twist the tool once, then bend the
jacket to break it free, so as to not nick the wire underneath. It is
kind of a tricky operation so I wish you good luck with it.

Bye for now....Oh by the way, we have just one tie wrap gun left if
anyone would like to come and take it.

T.I. 27c010-200  $5.75  5.75    5.75    10 week leadtime
Toshiba           9.25  8.35    8.15    8-10 week
Mitsubishi        9.10  8.87    8.64    4-8  week
Atmel             6.00  5.80    5.70     ? - worried about lawsuits ?


Since 10 weeks is too long for our June 14 production date, Mary went
to distribution (Wylie) and with some leverage from TI, got the price
down to $6.30. 

Mary says the 27c512-200 costs $2.75 (EPROM) or $2.40 (OTP).

So, (2) 27c512 @ $5.50 are only slightly less than (1) 27010 @ $5.75.
When you consider PCB space, and handling costs, the 27010 probably have
the edge - finally.

I asked Mary to get a reading on the stability of the $5.75 from TI. If
the forecast is stability (particularly on rising indications), then 
we are at the point of making a strategic decision of switching to 1 meg
EPROM's in our designs. Engineering management will discuss this
further, but it looks like something to plan on.

Subj:	Oki ADPCM chip


The Oki ADPCM chip we use is very sensitive to noise on the +5 line (this is
because the D/A is fed from +5). I recommend that we start using an RC filter
on the +5 to this chip to reduce the noise. Values of 33 ohms and 47uF seem to
work fine. Do not increase the resistor value much beyond this or you may
induce CMOS latchup in the chip.

         This Friday, May 11 is TIDY FRIDY. We will have an area in
         the back of the building to put all of your unneeded
         cabinets, controls, PCBs, monitors, and junk. (Next week will
         have a big "sale".) The goal is to clean out the labs,
         offices, common area, cages, etc. of all the junk that tends
         to accumulate. Please dress appropriately for the occasion!!

         You can begin sorting your stuff any time this week. Chris,
         Pat, and I will come by after lunch on Friday to help you
         decide what should be tossed (if you need the help).

         Those of you who own games should put your name on them
         (clearly) or put them in your office. They should be out of
         the labs/common area by 5/14.

         Refreshments will be provided Friday afternoon to quench your
         thirst after working so hard!! (Gatorade?)

Subj:	HARDWARE SPECIFIC SUBDIRECTORY.


If not already done please create two subdirectories in your project 
account. 
1. [project-name.RELEASE]
This is the directory to which you will copy your released code. This 
directory should be treated as a program MASTER. It will contain the
AROMREL.DOC file that is the key to those files. It will also keep the
released PAL/GAL jedec files and other hardware specific files that are
required for your game. It does not need to include the PAL/GAL source
files. This directory and the AROMREL.DOC file are required long before 
you actually release code, in order to create an accurate parts list, so if
you create it now we won't have to bother you when you are trying to make
field test deadlines etc. It is also a good idea to have a subdirectory in 
this directory to hold stable and matched versions of your program, 
graphics and audio before release. It is hard to debug hardware when we 
have mismatched rom codes.
2. [project-name.PAL]
This is the directory that will contain all the source codes for PALs, 
GALs, hardware specific PROMS etc. Engineers and Techs: please use these 
directories to develop and maintain your PAL sources. This makes the files 
available to those that need them, and everybody knows where to go to find 
them. It also ensures that these sources are archived properly at project
end. To make this more convenient the game engineer and technician should
have full access to the [.PAL] directory by ACL (access control list). If
you do not know how to set up an ACL I will be glad to help.

Subj:	Earth Day II: The Cafeteria


	Hey, Fellow Atari Employees,

	I had a thought just the other day.  It ran something like this:

	"Say, Paul, with all this hoopla about Earth Day, and the generally
Conservationist attitudes of the general Atari populace, why are we eating
every cafeteria meal off of polystyrene plates?  Those things will easily
outlive us all in whatever land fill they end up.  And that's without even
counting the possibility of the Chloro-Flourocarbons used in their manufacture
making the ozone layer more hole than ozone, thereby shortening our afore-
mentioned lives considerably.

	"So," I continued (having secured my rapt attention), "how about if
you send out a message suggesting switching back to the paper things we used
to have?  Surely the folks around here would gladly pay the extra 1 or 2 cents
per meal it would take to use the environmentally superior stuff.  Surely a
groundswell movement is just one VAXmail message away."

	So, was I right?... YOU make the call. 

				Paul "I don't want a tan THAT bad" Kwinn

Come on, pal, Earth Day is over! We don't have to worry about the dumb ole
Earth for another 20 years.

I like the way the styrofoam cups kinda float outta the cabinets when you 
open the door and land on your head.  When you are in a boring meeting, it
would be almost impossible to make fingernail sculptures on the side of
paper cups. And besides all that, I LIKE the way Omar's lunch melts into
the plates! The lunch wouldn't quite taste the same if it had to stand
on its own merits for taste and aroma.

Our Doughnuts arrive in paper boxes, what more do you want?

Added Note, seriously folks: All the styrofoam plates and cups we use
in a week don't add up to the amount of styofoam in one of our game
shipping containers. But I don't know of an easy solution to that one.

Don't you hate it when the grocery clerk has your nine-grain-sprouted-
wheat bread shoved in the plastic bag, and then asks, "Plastic, okay?"
That way you have to be the heavy and say "NO", and then you get that look
while they pull it out. You should insist that they ask you if you would
like paper or plastic. It just a little thing, but it always peeves me.

  Great idea Paul, a few cents extra for paper plates/bowls/cups  would be
a cheap solution to fight the overwelming effects that polystyrene waste  
has on our enviornment, and I'ld be willing to go the extra mile to do my
share.  Heck I would even bring my own silverware from home rather than 
using the plastics from the cafeteria.

  But don't you think we're over reacting to all this polution around us?
After all why should I care about what's gonna happen to MOTHER EARTH after
I'm gone anyway.  I'm definitely not worried about the possibility that 
some day my grandson will not be able to enjoy fishing and other outdoor
recreations because I don't even have a kid.  Come to think of it this 
polution thing sort of defeats the hopes for having a family and completely
relieves me of the burden of parenthood,  so hay its not such a bad thing
after all !!.

  You know Carole has a good point too about the food flavor.  I mean  
some people have gotten to like the flavor of melted polystyrene in their
lunch specials.  I'ld think twice about tampering with peoples taste buds
if I were you.

Subj:	Earth Day re-revisited


	I agree there was an awful lot of hoopla regarding Earth Day.
While I wouldn't put it the way Farrokh did, I also want to pass on a planet
my children can enjoy.  But it seems to me that everybody is missing the
point.  ("Look, isn't that cute?  They're all out of step but my Johnny!")

	Not all styrofoam is manufactured with CFC as a byproduct.  In fact,
almost all manufacturers have already changed by this time to environmentally
BENEFICIAL procedures and products.  Most styrofoam (polystyrene, McBoxes to
you family types) are already biodegradable.  They don't last as long as the
paper equivalent.

	The real problem is:  We are running out of dump sites.  Nobody wants
one in their backyard, and more and more land is becoming somebody's backyard.
Many plastics (including McBoxes) and some papers are PHOTOdegradable.  They
dissolve in sunlight within a few months.  But because nobody wants to deal
with disposables after they have been disposed, they are sealed in 
odor-resistant, opaque PLASTIC bags (5 mils thick, not a wimpy 2!), hauled off
to a landfill, and become part of the strata by the same afternoon (so they
don't smell).  Part of the disolving process involves conversion to inert
gasses.  But since they don't get any light, they don't disolve anyways.

	Paper is NOT an environmentally freindly alternative.  To start with,
paper is made out of trees we need to stay trees (I remind you that paper is 
about twice as dense as wood--it takes more trees than you think).  And, paper
also needs air to decompose.  If any of you have tried burning a magazine or 
newspaper in the fireplace, you'll realize what I mean.  We have archaeologists
digging in our own country.  They are pulling out of dumps, completely intact,
unread newspapers that are in mint condition...from the 40s.  By the TONS.
We are making our landfills (what a euphemism!) completely sterile.  Because
the  microorganisms that decompose waste produce chemicals which smell badly,
we perfume our dumps and impregnate them with chemicals to retard their
growth.  And then we mash everything so that it can't be penetrated except
for boring holes through the materials.  The microorganisms can't eat all at
once, they have to eat from the outside in.  We go to great lengths to ensure
that the return to the environment is stretched from as little as a few
months to well over 100 years.

	The point I'm trying to make (you were wondering, weren't you?) is this:
Make all the difference you can, cause if none of us does, that's no difference.
But know the difference you make.  It makes absolutely no difference if you
bury a paper plate or a plastic one for the next hundred years.  It makes no
discernable difference if you recycle a paper plate or a plastic one.  The
key issue is not paper versus plastic, it is bury versus recycle.  What
you can do that makes the biggest difference, is to NOT THROW STUFF OUT.
Recycle.  When you get packing peanuts, don't toss them in six wastebaskets.
Send your original box, still 90% full of peanuts, to shipping.  Toss your
pop cans in any of the collection boxes (you probably know of several).
Try NOT to use your trash can.  Don't BUY disposable stuff.  Don't use paper
plates at home to avoid washing plates.  If you don't read your paper,
cancel the subscription.  If you do, save them & give them to the Boy Sprouts.
If we all cut down in the amount of trash we throw out, we will help solve one
of the real problems.

	I don't have any solutions that would be generally acceptable as far
as what to do with the trash once we throw it out.  I'm not sure there is one.
We've re-evaluated that every time a dump closed.  Within a few months, another
one opens.  They have life expectancies even before they open.  They know just
how long we can collect the trash from this size area and pile it on this much
square feet, before height becomes a problem.

	I haven't quite figured out the solution to the rainforests, or
world hunger, or AIDs.  But it seems to me that we must be spoiling for
a war or something, because we are more interested in having a cause than
in knowing what it is.  I was both impressed and apalled at the Earth Day
special for its depth and its aim.  Apparently a number of other people also
were impressed.  That's great.  Let's all do something that makes a difference.

	The soapbox is now open.

maybe you already know it...

but Sam and Minh showed me a way to get into TRAnsparent mode on an AMS that
is hooked to a board that's been powered down.  It's always been frustrating
to need to use a terminal and be faced with > NO TARGET VCC
So all you need to do is
1) take the terminal off-line with NO SCROLL
2) enter the AMS-specific reset keystroke (usually CTL-X or CTL-Z)
3) type TRA and follow it with a couple of <RET> keystrokes
4) put the terminal back on-line with <NO SCROLL>
5) and VIOLET! it's connected!

Subj:	The command POST


A strange thing happened recently -- the VAX was very slow. So 
I used a couple of tools for finding out what was loading it 
down and found out that it was JUNK MAIL. 25% of KIM was being 
used to send out a message to everyone on the JUNK mail list.

When you use the normal SEND command (within the MAIL program) 
to @SYS$MAIL:JUNK, you tie up your terminal and the computer 
for quite a while. A better way to send mail to a large group 
is to first create a file that contains the text you want to 
send and then issue the following command (from the $ prompt, 
not from within MAIL):

POST filename.txt @SYS$MAIL:JUNK "Subject"

This will send the mail as a batch job on a fast computer. Your 
terminal is not tied up and you are not bogging down the slow 
computers. 

Thanks!!

TITLE:  FIRST IMPRESSION: 3's The One

Windows 3.0 Carries DOS Into The 1990s

by Jon Udell


Users of DOS PCs rejoice! Windows 3.0 will breathe new life
into your machine. Microsoft has bundled a graphical
environment, a suite of desktop applications, a DOS program
switcher, a Windows multitasking executive, a V86
multitasker, and a virtual memory manager into a single
package. Windows has long aspired to change the face of DOS
computing--not just for Excel or PageMaker addicts, but for
the rest of us. A year ago that transformation seemed
unlikely. Today it appears inevitable. Windows 3.0 finally
consummates the Windows/DOS marriage. That's good news
for the 386 crowd, and great news for the silent majority:
286 owners who've lately been made to feel they've bought an
Edsel.

Windows 3.0 runs in three modes: real, standard, and 386
enhanced. When you type WIN at the DOS command line,
Windows scopes out the local hardware configuration and
starts up in the appropriate mode: real on an 640K-byte XT or
AT, standard on an AT with at least 256K of extended memory
or a 386 with less than a megabyte of extended memory, and
386 enhanced on a 386 with more than a megabyte of
extended memory. All modes share the same radically
improved graphical interface, and enhanced suite of Windows
desktop applications. Standard mode adds the ability to run
Windows 3.0 applications in 286 protected mode--that is,
with direct access to up to 16 megabytes of extended
memory. 386 enhanced mode adds more: Preemptive
multitasking of DOS programs running in V86-based virtual
machines, and demand-paged virtual memory.

You can override the default startup behavior--for example,
you can type win /r  to start Windows 3.0 in real mode on a
286 or 386. And to run an existing Windows/286 or
Windows/386 application, that's just what you'll have to do.
Windows 3.0 is fundamentally a DOS extender. The
DOS-extended programs that it can execute--Windows 3.0
applications--must abide by the same laws that
govern all protected-mode applications. That means, among
other things, that a program can't write to a code segment,
perform segment arithmetic, compare segment addresses, or
load a segment register with a value other than one provided
by the operating system. 

Most existing Windows applications--and virtually all the
major ones--will require a tune-up in order to comply with
Windows 3.0. But the associated trauma won't be as severe as
you might think. Even ordinary DOS applications in general
port readily to DOS extenders. Windows programs, written to
a far stricter API that was designed with protected mode in
mind, find the transition even easier. Moreover, Windows
developers have been working with 3.0 for months; many have
already completed their ports. At least one shipping
application, Word for Windows, won't even require an
upgrade--it's already 3.0-compatible.

The New Windows Desktop

By design, the Windows desktop closely resembles that of
OS/2 1.2. And yes, that means that like PM, Motif, and
NextStep, Windows offers what seems to have become the
sine qua non of the modern graphical user interface: Buttons
shaded to create a three-dimensional effect. But there's a far
more significant enhancement. Both PM and Windows support
child windows that run as windows or as icons within the
boundaries of a parent window, sharing its menu bar. You can
see two examples of this behavior in the photo. Both the File
Manager (similar to OS/2 1.2's File Manager) and the Program
Manager (Windows 3.0's primary shell) contain child windows
in active and iconic states. 

I've yet to see another Windows 3.0 application that exploits
this technique (which IBM's Common User Access style guide
calls the multiple document interface, or MDI) as fully as File

Manager and Program Manager do. But the new SDK includes an
MDI code skeleton, and I hope many applications will adopt
this style. Other GUIs' window systems pale by comparison.
They limit you to a single top-level desktop. Windows 3.0
(like OS/2 1.2) supports a hierarchy of desktops. Each records
the arrangement of windows and icons running in support of a
task. You can collapse the whole aggregation into a top-level
icon, thus sweeping away a huge amount of visual clutter.
And you can recall the task with all its associated context
at a single stroke. Here's a practical way to manage a dozen
tasks, each with one or more windows--even on a standard
VGA screen.

You interact with Windows and DOS by way of five key
desktop applications: File Manager, Program Manager, Task
List, Control Panel, and Print Manager. File Manager, like its
OS/2 counterpart, views disk drives as an outline processor
does. Its primary child window presents a directory tree; you
single-click on nodes to show or hide their descendants.
Double-click on a directory node, and File Manager opens a
new child window that lists the files in that directory. You
can opt for an iconic or textual display, sorted in a variety of
ways. As with the old Windows MS-DOS Executive, you can
select and launch DOS or Windows applications directly, or
indirectly by way of documents associated with applications.
New conveniences include the ability to copy and move files
and subtrees using the mouse, to invoke an application by
"dragging and dropping" a compatible document onto its icon,
and to search for files.

File Manager and Program Manager

If you inspect the photo carefully, you'll see that File
Manager knows that the highlighted drive icon represents a
network drive. (The same holds true for CD-ROM drives.)
That's just a glimpse of Windows 3.0's network awareness. It
goes much further. The product provides extensive hooks for a
variety of networks--including MS-NET, Lan Manager,
NetWare, and VINES. When you install Windows 3.0 in the
presence of one of these networks, it loads a corresponding
driver. (NetWare users take note: You'll also need to update
your network shell components by way of NetWire or the
Novell hotline.) The network driver provides many
conveniences. From File Manager, for example, you can
execute Connect Net Drive. It provides a graphical interface
to MS-NET's NET USE, NetWare's MAP, or whatever command
your network uses for this purpose. With Browse, you can
look through the list of available servers and mounted
volumes for the drive to which you want to connect. The
specific form that this dialog takes will, again, vary
according to your network.

File Manager, like the Macintosh Finder, is fundamentally a
disk organizer. Program Manager works quite differently; it's
a task organizer. If you prefer the disk-oriented approach,
you can make File Manager the primary shell; just open
WIN.INI and specify shell=winfile.exe. But Windows 3.0
defaults to the Program Manager, and for good reason. Its
elements are groups and program items. Groups are child
windows that contain iconic program items which, in turn,
refer to applications and optionally to associated documents.
But when you create groups, add program items, and copy or
move program items between groups, you're not manipulating
the applications or documents themselves. You're
manipulating pointers to them. The added flexibility takes
some getting used to, but it's extremely useful.

You link program items to applications by way of Program
Manager's Properties dialog. Here you supply an application's
command line: A .EXE (Windows or DOS executable), .PIF
(Program Information File that tells Windows how to allocate
resources for a DOS program), .COM, or .BAT file, along with
command-line arguments if required. Unless you declined the
offer, the Windows setup program will have scanned your
local (and network) drives and created program items for all
the DOS applications for which Windows provides predefined
.PIFs.

Like File Manager, Program Manager can tile or cascade its
active child windows, and arrange those running as icons. You
can select and activate any group window or group window
icon from a list. And you can minimize any group window, or
minimize Program Manager itself.

Task List, Control Panel, Print Manager

Task List pops up when you double-click on the desktop, press
CTRL-ESC, or choose Switch To from any window's control
menu. It can tile or cascade top-level windows, arrange
top-level icons, enumerate tasks, switch to a task, or kill a
task. Incidentally, the several mouse and keyboard procedures
for starting Task List typify Windows 3.0. Like its
predecessors, and despite its greater complexity,
Windows 3.0 operates quite nicely under keyboard control. No
one will want to use the product without a mouse, but power
users will appreciate the dozens of keyboard shortcuts. 

The Control Panel provides a suite of configuration tools.
Some of the tasks you can perform here include: Reset the
desktop colors; install or remove printer and screen fonts;
attach to an alternate network server; configure
communications ports; install and configure printers; specify
multitasking settings for 386 enhanced mode. In the

Colors dialog, you can switch to an alternate desktop color
scheme, or invent your own. The Ports dialog repairs one
longstanding deficiency: At last Windows itself supports
XON/XOFF flow control.

The Printers dialog illustrates another facet of Windows'
new network awareness. Once you've specified a port (say,
LPT1) and a printer (say, HP LaserJet), you can browse
network print queues and connect the port to a queue that
supports your selected printer. Windows intelligently offers
to bypass the local spooler and print directly to the network
queue. With earlier versions of Windows, you had to disable
spooling entirely in order to use network queues. Now you can
configure spooling on a per printer basis.

Print Manager handles both local and network queues. Even
when you bypass the Windows spooler to print straight to a
network queue, you can use Print Manager to monitor the job's
progress. Local queues display only jobs printed from
Windows applications, but network queues--thanks to the
intervention of the network driver--list all your print jobs.
By default, a network queue won't list other users' jobs, but
you can ask to see the complete list and (again depending
on the specific capabilities of your network and its Windows
driver) you can even browse network queues to which you're
not connected.

The desktop applications offer extensive online help. Like
OS/2 1.2, Windows 3.0 documents itself hypertextually and,
in its SDK, provides tools and protocols that enable
applications to follow suit. The Windows 3.0 applications I've
seen do take advantage of the help engine, which lends a nice
consistency to the environment. I particularly like the way
the help system enables users to annotate online
documentation.

Wide Open Spaces

As I write these words, I'm running Windows 3.0 in 386
enhanced mode on a 20Mhz, 4MB, 80386-based Gateway 2000. Task List
reports that I'm running FoxBASE (in a virtual DOS machine),
Epsilon (in another virtual DOS machine), five Windows 3.0
desktop applications (File Manager, Program Manager,
Paintbrush, Terminal, and Notepad), and three additional
Windows 3.0 applications (Microsoft's Excel, Samna's
Ami Professional, and Asymetrix' Hypercard-like ToolBook).
CHKDSK, which I ran in each of the two DOS sessions,
reported 477K bytes of free DOS memory--scarcely less than
the 486K bytes available to DOS after I booted and loaded my
network drivers, but before I launched Windows. Meanwhile,
Program Manager reports more than 10 megabytes of free
Windows memory. How can this be? Well, DOS multitasking
based on the V86 mode of the 80386 processor is nothing
new. But add protected-mode Windows applications running in
extended memory with access to virtual memory, and you're
really pushing out the envelope.

It's a different story on a 286--but not too different. On the
DOS side, you substitute program switching for DOS
multitasking, you give up hardware protection, and you get
somewhat less DOS memory. Running Windows in standard
mode on a 1-megabyte Compaq 286e, I found that a
secondary DOS session saw 44K bytes less free memory than
did the boot session. On the Windows side, you give up virtual
memory. Yet although standard mode appears limited when
you compare it to 386 enhanced mode, it legitimizes the 286
in a way that no other software product ever has. You can
still run multiple DOS applications reasonably, side by side
with Windows applications. And those Windows applications,
using as much extended memory as you care to install, will
really be able to stretch their legs. 

DOS extenders come in two flavors. 286 extenders, such as
Rational Systems' DOS 16/M, break through the 640K memory
barrier, enabling programs to run in extended memory on a
286 or 386. But they still form addresses with 16-bit
offsets, and so can't manipulate data objects larger than 64K.
386 extenders, such as Phar Lap's 386|DOS-Extender, also
break the 64K segment barrier. They run only on a 386, but
can form addresses with 32-bit offsets and so present a
``flat'' 4Gb address space to applications. Windows 3.0 is a
286 extender. It runs programs in extended memory, but even
on a 386 those programs don't see the flat address space
characteristic of Phar Lap, Unix, or OS/2 2.0. To manipulate,
for example, very large bitmaps, Windows 3.0 programs must
still resort to the huge memory model which "tiles"
segments.

Although Windows 3.0 does offer 386-specific features--V86
multitasking and demand-paged virtual memory--the 80286
is its true target platform. And while the 64K segment limit
may be inconvenient, the 640K limit has been Windows' ball
and chain. That's gone now, and both 286 and 386 users will
reap the benefits. Existing Windows applications, once
converted, will enjoy what amounts to a free lunch. And
developers who just couldn't contemplate working in
real-mode Windows will think much harder about developing
for Windows 3.0.

Living With Windows 3.0

Like many people, I've always thought of Windows as an
application launcher, not a working environment. I'm no fan of
DOS shells; the ones I've tried feel like straightjackets. But
the notion of a dual environment in which DOS and Windows
applications coexist was always alluring. And so with each
successive version of Windows, I've put the WIN command
into my AUTOEXEC.BAT, just to see how long it could survive
there. Earlier versions of Windows never lasted more than a
day. This one's a keeper. For the first time, the Windows/DOS
coexistence entails relatively few compromises. DOS
sessions see more memory than in previous versions of
Windows--in standard mode as well as in 386 enhanced mode.
Even more important to me, access to network services
removes what had been a major obstacle to sustained use of
Windows. For example, Windows used to simply reject a
message sent over a network. Now it fields the message and
presents it in a Windows alert box. The only major
sacrifice--and this will be a problem for many users--is that
you can't use protected-mode memory managers like QEMM
and 386Max with Windows 3.0's standard or 386 enhanced
modes.

Some of the things I've learned about Windows aren't new to
3.0. Like Windows/386, Windows 3.0 supports cut-and-paste
operations between windowed DOS programs and Windows
applications. One evening, while connected to BIX by way of
Windows Terminal, I used the BIX search command to
generate a list of messages. The next step was to reformat
the message numbers as a comma-separated list, and feed
that list to the FILE command. I copied the SEARCH output
from Terminal's buffer to the Clipboard, pasted it into my
DOS text editor, built a macro to reformat the numbers, and
pasted the result back into Terminal. 

What's new--to me, anyway--isn't the cut-and-paste feature
itself, but the opportunity to use it. You'd never load Windows
just to cut and paste between applications. And you'd never
load it just to run one of its accessories: Notepad, Write,
Terminal, Paintbrush, Calendar, Calculator, and Cardfile. But
if you establish the Windows desktop as your working
environment--and 3.0 makes that eminently practical--you'll
find that it has a lot to offer. 

I've always used Notepad for quick text-editing tasks in the
Windows environment, but now I find Write perfectly
adequate for memos and correspondence. Paintbrush, derived
from ZSoft's PC Paintbrush, operates in color and improves in
many other ways on the old Windows Paint program. Since it
supports both .PCX and .BMP (Windows bitmap) formats, it
serves as a gateway between DOS- and Windows-based image
processing programs. 

Terminal now handles binary file transfers; while not a
"full-featured" telecommunications program (there's no
scripting capability), it's nevertheless quite useful. The new
Calculator adds a scientific mode. It supports trigonometric
and statistical functions, and can operate in binary, octal,
and hexadecimal number systems. Even Cardfile--a sort of
rolodex that can store scraps of text and (black and white)
images--turns out to be surprisingly handy. Like the Mac's
Scrapbook, Cardfile holds a persistent collection of clipboard
items. 

Raster Rainbows

Right out of the box, running on a standard VGA display,
Windows 3.0 looks more colorful than its predecessors.
Tasteful use of color has much to do with that impression.
Although you can change the desktop's color scheme, you'll be
hard put to come up with a better one. But there are also
more colors to work with. Earlier versions of Windows could
use just eight of the sixteen pure colors available in the VGA
640x480x16 mode; Windows 3.0 uses them all.

Behind the scenes, there's a whole new color architecture
waiting to be exploited. The new Windows API defines 1-, 4-,
8-, and 24-plane device-independent bitmaps. These formats,
compatible with OS/2 color bitmaps, extend the device
independence that Windows applications enjoy to the realm
of color imagery. Hardware color capability, not Windows
itself, becomes the limiting factor. 

To support color-intensive Windows applications, the new
API also defines a set of palette-management functions.
These facilitate orderly arbitration among applications
competing for the use of a limited supply of colors. An
application can define a list of colors that it requires, in
order of importance. When it runs in the foreground, the
application gets first choice of the colors available in the
system palette. Background applications contend for the
remaining colors; they receive consideration in reverse order
of activation. If the system palette runs out of free colors,
Windows maps some or all of their requests to the closest
colors already in use, taking each application's specified
color priorities into account. 

Windows reserves a pool of 20 static colors; that's the
default palette used for window titles, menu bars, and other
standard desktop elements. That means most applications
won't need to concern themselves with the intricacies of palette 
arbitration. And on a 16-color VGA display, it's not even an issue. 
But as Windows 3.0 drivers for more capable video boards arrive, and 
as Windows applications begin to exploit 256 and more colors, the 
palette manager will come into its own. Video Seven and 8514/A
drivers do come in the box, by the way. But most users of
better-than-VGA display hardware will have to wait a while
to find out what Windows 3.0 can really do with color. 

Running DOS Applications

When you run DOS programs under Windows 3.0, standard and
386 enhanced modes correspond closely to Windows/286 and
Windows/386. In standard mode, DOS programs run fullscreen
and uninterrupted. You can have one or more DOS sessions;
each swaps to disk when you switch away from it. Standard
mode does improve on Windows/286 in several ways. There's
more memory for DOS programs because Microsoft has
dropped a little-used feature of Windows/286--the ability to
window "well-behaved" applications. And Program Manager
and Task List make it easier to find and switch to your DOS
applications.  Windows 3.0's 386 enhanced mode, like
Windows/386, creates a powerful hybrid environment. The
Windows session, within which Windows applications
multitask cooperatively, itself multitasks preemptively with
one or more virtual DOS machines. A DOS program can run
fullscreen or in a window; ALT-ENTER toggles between the
two display modes. You can window textual and (with
restrictions) graphical displays. 

Each virtual machine inherits and can customize the boot DOS
session. Since the original TSR memory hit propagates to all
virtual machines, it's best to start lean--for example, with
just network drivers--and load extras on a per-session basis.
There's no AUTOEXEC.BAT for virtual machines, but you can
use .PIF files, in conjunction with .BAT files, to tailor DOS
sessions for specific purposes.  

The 386 enhanced mode outclasses Windows/386 in several
respects. Virtual memory enables you to run more DOS
sessions. And you've got greater control over how those
sessions multitask. A Windows/386 .PIF file offers three
options. Foreground means run only in foreground, while
background tasks run concurrently. Background means run in
foreground or background, while background tasks run
concurrently. Exclusive means run only in foreground, and halt
all other tasks. Windows 3.0 preserves and extends these
options. You can adjust each DOS task's (or Windows' own)
foreground and background timeslice. A new form of
the exclusive mode gives a DOS task all the cycles it wants
while active, but enables Windows to switch away from it
when idle. When there's an interrupt pending to a virtual
machine, Windows temporarily boosts its priority to
maintain crisp keyboard response. And in special cases, you
can speed up a DOS program by locking its EMS, XMS, or
conventional memory.

Virtual machines require virtual devices. Windows provides
drivers for the basic ones--disk, video, keyboard--but you
might run into a problem with a less common device. For
example, my floppy-controller-based tape drive won't work
with Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode, so I can't run tape
backups in the background. 

What about DOS-extended programs? For now, you have to
drop down to standard mode to run 286 DOS-extended
programs like Lotus 1-2-3 release 3, and to real mode to run
386 DOS-extended programs like IBM Interleaf Publisher. But
there's hope of better things to come. The DOS extender
companies are working hard to comply with the new DOS
Protected Mode Interface (DPMI), which will enable Windows
3.0 (or any other "DPMI server") to multitask protected-mode
applications. It sounds even scarier than VCPI (Virtual
Control Program Interface), but the current popularity of DOS
extenders and the likely success of Windows 3.0 will
probably make DPMI a reality.

The OS/2 Killer?

Has Microsoft committed corporate fratricide? Yes and no.
Windows 3.0 addresses, and satisfies, many pressing needs.
Rarely does an operating system upgrade render existing
hardware so much more useful. 3.0 will delight longtime
Windows fans, and win many new converts. Developers are
flocking to the platform, in some cases shifting their focus
from OS/2's Presentation Manager to Windows. The Windows
momentum that has been building for the last year or so is
about to become a tidal wave.

But scratch the elegantly polished surface, and you'll still
find creaky old DOS. OS/2 really is much better. Its
multithreaded architecture, 32-bit programming model, High
Performance File System, and rich Graphical Programming
Interface should, eventually, earn it the respect it deserves.

Windows 3.0 could be the best thing that ever happened to
OS/2. It's ideally positioned to draw huge numbers of DOS
users into the realm of GUI-based multitasking. Many will
remain happily within the Windows fold. As client/server
applications evolve, the Windows 3.0 client
workstation--communicating with servers running OS/2 or
its competitors--seems destined to become an important
industry standard. But power users who yearn for a better
foundation under the graphical desktop will find the move
from Windows to OS/2 quite natural.

In the meantime, on both technical and strategic grounds,
Windows 3.0 succeeds brilliantly. After years of twists and
turns, Microsoft has finally nailed this product. Try it. You'll
like it.

Subj:	THE BIRTH OF MRP


Today, May 26th at approximately 8:25am, MRP was born at ATARI Games. It has
been gently and caringly produced by the Production Control Department over
the last few months. It is still a little shaky, a little vunerable, but it
shows great promise.

The promise, for those of us that are not familiar with MRP, is a faster,
more controlled, and more accurated response to the nervous nature of the
Master Schedule which is driven by the whimsical market place.

MRP (Material Requirements Planning) is a tool that is used, in one form or
another, by ALL of the Fortune 1000+ companies. It is a tool that will provide
ATARI Games to more effectively compete at the Global Manufacturing Level.

We must learn how to use this tool effectively and creatively, this will come
with time. The real purpose of this memo is to thank everyone in the company
for the great support that is being provided to manufacturing so that we could
make MRP happen.

                       Thax again,     Tom Smith

ps. accurated should be accurate

Subj:	New 'game' at Great America


         I was at Great America yesterday (doing my weekly market
         research, of course), and I noticed a "spacey" new "attraction"
         called LazerTron (I think). It is not in the same area as the
         midway and the bank of Final Laps, but is next to the Edge. It
         costs $3 for one person or $5 for a team of two people and lasts
         about 3 minutes. (There was no line forming at this attraction!)

         After you pay your money, you are given a battery operated
         gun about 2 feet long. You are given the instructions "when
         you see a robot, shoot him right between the eyes". When the
         doors open, you go into a darkened room. A light goes on
         illuminating one of about 10 robots -- lights flash if you
         get him between the eyes. The robots (just sitting there, not
         moving) light up randomly all around you for about 45
         seconds, then you are told to go to the next room. There are
         a total of 3 rooms.  (This whole attraction is the size of an
         RV trailer.) When you leave the third room and go back
         outside, you can see a TV monitor that displays your score
         and the last 5 scores.

         It was basically Whac-a-Mole or a shooting gallery. It was
         not much fun and far too expensive. It could only work where
         you have a steady stream of "suckers".

Subj:	Styrofoam...


Some of the recent information put fourth on junk mail regarding safe
polystyrene (styrofoam) was potentially misleading.  Here is some additional
information from the book "50 SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO SAVE THE EARTH":

BACKGROUND: What we think of as "styrofoam" is actually polystyrene foam.
This material is made from benzene (a known carcinogen), converted to styrene,
and then injected with gases that make it a "foam" product.  The gases often
used are CFCs - which "eat" ozone molecules, depleting the Earth's vital ozone 
layer.  The alternatives to CFCs at present aren't wonderful.  One is HCFC -
95% less damaging than CFCs, but still a threat to the ozone layer.  Others
are pentane and butane, hydrocarbons that contribute to urban smog.  So
non-CFC foam merely trades one kind of environmental problem for another.

IT'S GARBAGE:
o  Polystyrene foam is completely non-biodegradable; it just won't go 
away.  Even 500 years from now, that foam cup that held your coffee this 
morning might be sitting on the Earth's surface.
o  Because of its very structure - containing large amounts of air - all 
"styrofoam" (regardless of how it's made) takes up a lot of space for its 
weight.  This means it wastes enormous amounts of precious space at 
already-bulging landfills.
o  Polystyrene foam is deadly to marine life.  It floats on ocean surfaces, 
breaks up into pellets resembling food, and is consumed.  When sea turtles, 
for example, eat "styrofoam" its buoyancy keeps them from diving; it clogs 
their systems and they starve to death.

SIMPLE THINGS TO DO:
o  There are no such things as "safe" polystyrene foam.  Don't use it.  
Avoid foam packaging in egg cartons, disposable picnic goods, etc.
o  If you eat at fast food restaurants, ask for paper cups and plates.

			***************

Additional note:  the cafeteria folk don't mind if you bring your own plate
& utencils.  They also don't mind putting small items (egg on muffin, etc) on
napkins instead of styrofoam plates.  As the consumer, YOU have the final vote.

extra two minutes to get ALL of you cans and bottles to the bins. We can't
let them get piled up in the offices and the cleaning people will not take
them for you.
   The next on our agenda for a cleaner Atari is recycling paper and getting
all the styrafoam products down to the minimum...(remember to try to bring

Subj:	More garbage for our mental landfill...


Just to throw more trash into the heap about recycling I thought I'd mention
that there was an archeologist on TV last week (I believe his name is Dr.
Rafferty) who has been studying our (USA citizens) refuse at dumps and
landfills all across the country for the past 15 years. His findings are
very interesting even though the sample size is limited.

He and his crews have been using the procedures adpoted and used by most modern
archeologists, so I don't have any reason to believe that he's lying about any
of this. I can't remember everything, but the high points are:

	20 years ago (1970) 11% (by volume) of the country's trash was plastic 
	products (which I believe included styrofoam and stuff like that).
	Today (1990) 12% (by volume) of the country's trash is plastic products.
	Not the substantial difference that I've been led to believe
	from other sources. He claims that even though we are tossing more
	plastic stuff away, it takes up less space (i.e. it squashes down
	to a very small volume).

This is not to say that throwing away plastic is a good thing nor that we
can continue to toss stuff as we are, only that if we stopped doing it all
together it wouldn't make as big a difference as we have been led to believe.

	20 years ago about 17% of the country's trash was paper
	products. Today 36% of our trash is paper products. This includes
	all forms of magazines, junk mail, newspapers, napkins, 
	paper plates, etc. This one item (paper products) represents
	the single largest component of our trash content. Everyone
	thinks it is disposable diapers and plastic, but according to
	his measurements, everyone is wrong.

If this is true, it appears evident to me that if we want to reduce the rate of
landfill expansion, we must cut back on the disposal of all forms of paper
products. If we didn't use paper we wouldn't have to throw it out and we'd
save some trees too. Although he didn't state exactly how much, he implied that
telephone books are a major contributor to this mess. (Personally, I think
newspapers would win the award hands down for being the greatest waste of
resources and the largest contributor to landfill expansion). 

He also claims that there really is no such thing as "bio-degradable".
To demonstrate that idea he dug up from a landfill a copy of the San Jose
Mecury News looking like it had been rained on but otherwise in decent
shape only the date on which it was printed was sometime in 1963. He also
pulled out numerous supermarket coupons also dated in the 60's. The point 
being that they might be biodegradable in a techincal sense, in a practical
sense they are not since it will certainly be hundreds and maybe even thousands
of years before all traces of this garbage is gone. Paper is not biodegradable.

He also pointed out that items that are supposed to be biodegradable are
actually comprised of components which will "degrade" at different rates. For
example,the components of some of the inks that are used in and on the so called
"biodegradable" products are toxic and as their "host" degrades these toxins are
released and will eventually end up in our ground water. It might be that these
things are better left right where they are. Can anybody be sure that whatever
they make their "biodegradable" junk out of is itself not toxic or will not
become toxic? Does anybody know if the components of the ink used in newsprint
is non-toxic under all circumstances?

P.S. Starting tomorrow, we'll be disconnecting all the printers, Xerox machines
and Fax machines.

P.P.S. Just kidding.

Subj:	One more item on garbage - RECYCLE


	For those of you who are not aware, I have been recycling cans, glass,
newspapers, and magazines for quite some time.  I have boxes in my office 
and lab for your use.  There is no need to dump the weekly supply of magazines
in the can when you can place them in a box in my office.  As long as the 
volume is small I do not mind taking all the recycle to PCC or some other
organization.  If someone wants the extra money and wants to take my cans
or whatever, please feel free AS LONG AS it is recycled.

	It never ceases to amaze me how someone can walk by my office and
throw a can in the trash when there is recycle box next to the trash can.
Maybe, it was my upbringing, but it is really tragic to live outside Seattle,
where Seattle now has it's dump, and see the newspapers, etc pile up and
see the acres next to your property stripped of trees to be made into
paper products.

I wouldn't call the survey anything close to statistically significant,
but the phone in replies that were printed were about 66% against and
33% in favor of the dollar coin.  They didn't report any complete tabulation
of the results, they just printed the actual verbatim replies from about
25 of the phone calls.

Consumer perception is that the coin is bulky and heavy, paper is much
easier to handle.  There is also a lot of negative feeling about a dollar
coin due to the failure of the S.B.A. coin.

It is this negative consumer response that we (the coin-op industry) are 
fighting and it is going to be an uphill battle.  Write your congressman!!!

Subj:	RECYCLING BEVERAGE CONTAINERS


I have the perfect solution to fixing one part of the
recycling issue...beverage containers.

1. The deposit on cans and bottles should be raised
from the low CA redemption value to maybe $.10.  Now
the container has real value to most people, not just
some.  I still bend over to pick up a dime but not a
penny.

2. The retailer that sells a certain brand of
beverage must also redeem those containers.  So, now
when you walk into the store you will be carrying a
lighter bag than when you walked out.  At this point
there is incentive to get your money back or trade
there again and not pay more deposit money.

3. The wholesaler or bottler that drives that very
heavy truck loaded with liquids from the factory can
now return, no longer empty, but doing something
useful.  The same goes for the guy or gal wheeling
these cases in the store.  Full cans in...empty ones
out.  The bottler and retailer is to be responsible
for the recycle of the containers.

4. As I recall, this is the way that Oregon does it.
Containers are to be clean and not crushed.  The
beverage trucks up there have a special bin area in
the back for transporting empties

5. By forcing bottlers and retailers to be part of
the solution there is a possibility of even having
reusable bottles in the system again.

6. After watching recycling efforts flounder for the
last 20 years, I think for the most part,
Californians don't really care.  Voluntary efforts
work to a point, but major things will happen when
you squeeze someone's wallet.  The bottling industry
is very powerful and has effectively blocked any real
advances in recycling containers in my opinion.  In
the past Californians have voted down measures that
cause inconvenience or economic committment to
recycling.

7. Oops!  I kinda drifted away from the plan and to
my attitude.....

8. So, when you review legislation at voting time,
look for the key notes!
  1.   Bottlers and retailers are bad guys when
     it comes to accepting responsibility.
  2.   Californians respond when someone else has
     their money (significant deposit).  More
     people will participate when it's two
     bucks instead of .20.
  3.   Bottlers and cigarette companies are
     brothers.  Look for sneaky fronts like the
     'citizens committee for choice' during
     campaigns.
  4.   Voluntary good citizen recycling efforts
     are only a start at solving the problem.
     Besides, all those cans lying around just
     remind you of the junk that you put
     through your body!!!

      From RADICAL MAN,
                  JERRRRRY

Subj:	Just when you thought it was safe...


	I have implemented a new set of coin routines, which has been
"alpha tested" on Hard Drivin and a few other games. Now the hard part-
making it the "official" set. If you don't give a rodent's posterior about
coin handling, stop now. Ok, for starters, here are the new options:

	Free play (yes/no)
	Discount for continue (yes/no)
	Bonus Threshold (number of coins needed for bonus: 2-9)
	Bonus Award (number of coins added each time threshold passed: 0-3)
	Game cost (1-8 coins)
	Right mech multiplier (aka value, 1-8)
	Left mech multiplier (aka value, 1-8)


	At present there are a few, uh, features that bear changing:

   *	The game program must "know" where the "discount" bit is stored
	and deal with it.

   *	The old kluge of clearing bc and bccnt "at the right time" is
	still needed.

   *	cn_credit still reports (credits * 12), although with game prices
	as high as 8, The multiplier _should_ be 840. On the other hand,
	the table of strings for normalized fractions would get out of
	hand...

   *	MAXCOINS is still 30 (up from 25) which could be a problem for
	operators using five-dollar-bill acceptors and wanting to give
	a bonus for a five, but allowing a $.25 continue...

   *	The usual problems of the hardware guys braiding the coin inputs
	and wanting software to unbraid them.

   *	The current (as I type) version apparently resets the options to
	defaults if a coin comes in before the mainline sets coin_modes
	to the value in the EEPROM. (Yes, I'll fix it, but it's part of
	the problem with the first "feature" above, and I didn't see it
	until I started composing this.)

   *	The current code (descended from System I) doesn't really deal
	with compilers/machines that have non-atomic add-to-memory.
	GreenHills (or Gnu CC) on a uni-processor 68k has no problem,
	but ASAPs or multi-68k games may lose coins once in a blue moon.

   *	For reasons having to do with System I (again) the current code
	declares its variables "extern" and lets "someone else" allocate
	them. This is almost never needed and never a real good idea.

   *	I'm sure I missed some.


	Anyway, I'd like to call a meeting of "Concerned Citizens" to
clean up this mess. Please let me know when you are available (presuming
you'd like to help out) Backward compatability to System I is not our
top priority, but experience has taught me not to make gratuitous changes.

Subj:	recycling recycled


I live in San Jose. San Jose has curb-side recycling.
Everyday I trek outside with my paper, aluminum, and glass separated.
Once a week I take the bins to the curb.
Once a week someone comes along and steals my aluminum.
	Some of you would say that is okay, since the aluminum is getting
     recycled anyway. But if it continues to happen, the City won't have
     enough money to continue to send out the trucks, and they will probably
     scrap the whole program.
But they do still pick up the glass!
Then I read in the Merc News that the glass recycling company for the city
took all the glass to the dump, because they couldn't find any buyers for
it.


Recycling has a poor chance of working unless there are big incentives (read
"pressure") on manufacturers and bottlers to buy used glass. It is probably
cheaper and easier for them to buy new glass.

And yes Jerry, I do remember always taking my old coke bottles to the store
when I was going to buy some more. The system seemed to work in those days.

Since recycling programs are now so poorly managed or utilized, it seems
like there is only one thing left to do: Take your bottles to the store and
stand there while the merchant refills them with whatever it was that you
wanted.

(Yuch! Bulk mayonaisse?)

Here's the latest on new competitor products:

- Bally has a football version of ArchRivals called Pigskin which is
  supposedly dropping quickly on test.  It is in the June issue of
  RePlay.  Sounds like it has great potential, but the earnings info
  is per several distributors and Frank C. in sales.

- Technos' Combatribe kit for 2-3 players is the current hot piece
  selling for around $1200 net to distributors.  It also is shown in
  the June trade mags...looks very much like 3-player Double Dragon.

  They are saying orders are between 3000-4000 so far.

- Taito is having a distributor meeting next week and is supposedly
  showing a track-ball based HORSHOE game...don't know the name or
  exact price but it is targeted as a low cost kit for bars.  

  Sounds familiar doesn't it??  We will report back to Shooz team
  as more info comes in.

Subj:	More on the command POST


	Last week, John Ray sent out a mass mailing about mass mailing.
The bottom line was that you could (and should) avoid interactive use of
MAIL if your usage wasn't really interactive.  He suggested:
	$ POST filename[.txt] @SYS$MAIL:JUNK "Subject"
...which will in fact work.  But it requires a change in thinking; you must
remember the order, and the quotation marks around the subject are
required, unless you have a single word, all-capital subject.  And quoting
things in commands is sometimes icky, too.

	What John didn't know (cuz I didn't tell him) is that there was an
improvement to POST.  The above still works.  But whatever you don't
supply, you will be prompted for, as with most VAX commands.  And, when you
answer a prompt, quotation marks aren't required.

	So you can say something like:
	$ POST filename		(and then a CR; filename will default to .TXT)
	To: @SYS$MAIL:JUNK	(or whatever you want, including a list)
	Subject: Anything you want to talk about, how you want it to look.
...Or, if you think this way,
	$ POST filename @SYS$MAIL:MARKETING,@SYS$MAIL:TENGEN
	Subject: Sample of mailing to more than one list at a time.
...Of course, you can do it the old way, which still works:
	$ POST filename[.txt] @SYS$MAIL:JUNK "Subject"

	As always, if it works, that's great, but if not, you're on your own.

    In reference to the LICHAC memo concerning plastic beverage containers.

	These containers ARE recyclable.  I know that there is curbside 
pickup of these containers in Fremont, Newark, Union City, Mountain View,
Palo Alto, San Jose and other places in the bay area.  These containers
can also be sold at various centers.  

	As you know, the most effective way to cut down on waste, is to not
throw out.  A good place to start is with the disposable coffee cups.  Please,
please don't use them.. bring in your own mug.  By using a coffee mug, you
will be helping to cut waste, and you may find your cup-o-joe tastes better.
If you need a mug, we can get you one.

I HOPE I'M WRONG.  IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE AN INEFFICIENT USE OF ENERGY TO
KEEP REMANUFACTURING THE SAME THING WHEN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.
JOHN'S COMMENT ABOUT THE COFFEE CUP IS THE POINT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
MAKE, MAYBE NOT SUCCESSFULLY: MAKE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER ONCE, WASH IT
AND USE IT AGAIN.  IF THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE DONE, MAKE THE DEPOSIT
SYSTEM ECONOMICALLY MANDATORY SO THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT CONCERNED

Subj:	Recyclables revisited (yet again)


Speaking of plastics recyling...
	At the current time, it is actually easier to recycle SOME plastics
than it is to recycle glass (other than to re-use the glass containers).
However, the demand for both recycled glass and plastics is lagging
behind the various local and state programs around the country that are
rapidly coming into place which requires the return of glass and plastic
containers (and also paper products, for that matter).  This appears to
be a transitionary problem however as the recycled products industry begins
to take shape.  In just the last 3 months, the demand for recycled plastics
from the 2-litre beverage container has shot up dramitically.  There is an
outfit in the southeast that uses the ground up plastic from these containers
to make RUGS.  They use approx. 55 2-litre bottles per square yard of carpet
and they make carpet by the thousands of linear yards each day!
	They did not have a reliable supply (hence their lack of interest in
using recycled products) until AFTER the state of New Jersey came down HARD
on all of its citizens to perform MANDATORY seperation of trash into all
products which are recyclable.  (This was due to the fact there is only a
single landfill site left in the entire state!)  They even have garbage cops
which inspect curbside trash to make sure there is nothing there that should
be in the recycled bins.  Fines up to $5000 have been levied against repeat
offenders (usually landlords which have a tough time getting all their
tennents to cooperate)!
	Anyway, the point of all this is that the creation of an entire
infrastructure to handle recycled products does not happen overnight, and
there will be cases such as the one that happened locally where tons of
glass had to be taken to the landfill instead of recycled.  BUT, the
facilities to use these products ARE beginning to pop up (especially in the
area of recycled paper products which has been around for a long time, but
has not been able to keep pace with the recent increase in the growth of
recycled product).
	SO...  Whatever form of recycling you use, do it!  At the very least,
you are developing habits which are a positive step toward keeping garbage
out of landfills and sooner or later (hopefully sooner), ALL of the stuff
we put out for recycling will actually help reduce the demand for those same
raw materials!
	Enough soapbox...
	Rusty

Subj:	Just trying to put out more messages than Jerry on this subject.


	I see the problem is that there are just too many people using too much
stuff. We should reduce the need for recycling by reducing the amount of
useless packaging. People buy all this pre-packaged stuff in the first place
because they are lazy or don't have time............ and then we expect them
to take all this extra time to recycle the package they bought to save time.
People buy prepared beverages because the don't take the time or effort to
make their own. (Remember Ice Tea and Lemonade?) We never used to be able to
buy individually wrapped ultra-pasteurized cheese food and squeezable
ketchup. Have you noticed that all this overly-packaged food is all stuff
that isn't healthy for us to eat or drink anyway?

 	So maybe the answer isn't to make recycling easy. Maybe it should be
absolutely mandatory and incredibly cumbersome .........so then people will
stop buying all this packaged stuff to begin with.

	Then we can put all our out-of-work citizens to work washing bottles
and returning them to the mayonaisse manufacturer.(....but then that will
use a lot of water, oops, next problem....)

Subj:	two items for today


a) How to solve part of Tengen's trouble: 
	Compile a list of all of the Toys R Us stores in the country and
each of us while we have a free moment at our desk during the day or
evening can call a few stores and ask "Do you have Gauntlet?"; "Do you carry
RBI Baseball?"; etc. Ask all your friends and relatives to go to the store
with sad-eyed little kids and ask for Tengen titles. Inundate all the stores
that don't carry Tengen. It might work.


b) Tonight: If you liked "The Big Chill", watch the movie that they ripped
off - "The Return of the Secaucus Seven" tonight on 36 at 8 pm. This was John 
Sayles first big movie.

Subj:	SMASH TV @ Milpitas Golfland


I forgot to give you my weekly Milpitas Golfland report on 
Monday!! 

They have the new Williams game SMASH TV. It is a two player 
game with ROBOTRON controls. I didn't get very far, but the 
idea was to kill the hordes of bad guys that come into the room 
you are in through doors at the edge of the screen.

It didn't seem to be attracting much attention (although the 
arcade was pretty quiet).

I need to have the wheels on my car balanced for high-speed driving,i.e.,
freeway driving.  To my knowledge this is a little more involved than 
just regular ol' wheel balancing.  can anyone out there recommend
 a place
in Milipitas (or even the immediate environs) for such a service?

                                    Thanks,

Subj:	Color Animation


We have created what I believe to be a fairly useful general utility to do
color animation (flashing & rotate) in a very painless yet speedy fashion.

If you are interested, the set of routines you need will allow to start an
individual color flashing in any palette, or a contiguous group of colors
rotating in any palette.  The rate of update and, for rotates, the direction
of rotation can be set at initialization.  Multiple animations can be going on
in the same or different palettes.  The rotuine to be called during VBLANK is
written in assembly and optimized for speed.  Starting an animation requires
only one C level function call.  Individual animations can be killed by a
C level call, or all current animations can be killed by one call.  All
necessary initialization routines have been provided.

The flashing routines are set up for IRGB where:

	I is bit 15 of the color word
	R is bits 14-10 of the color word
	G is bits  9-5  of the color word
	B is bits  4-0  of the color word

This code is easily modified for other color configurations.

The code assumes that each entry in any palette is one word (16 bits).  It
should work for any size palette with slight modification, but it has only
been tested on 16 color palettes.

The C rotuines need to have typdefs for U8 ... S32, as well as approriate
hardware locations.

The asm code needs to have the definitions for SWITCH1 and SLFTST.

You need the following three files, all which are in ee$ useridsk:[shooz]

	canim.c
	structs.h
	canimasm.asm

Good Luck,

	- Ed -

Subj:	Atari Games Repurchases Stock of Major Shareholder


I am pleased to announce the signing of a definitive agreement
by Atari Games to repurchase 100% of the Atari Games stock now
owned by Namco.  As a result of this transaction, Namco will
also receive Atari Operations Inc. after paying additional cash 
and other consideration to Atari Games.  Atari Operations Inc.
operates more than 40 video game arcades in the Western and
Southeastern United States.

Once completed, the transaction leaves Time Warner Inc. as
the only major outstanding shareholder of Atari Games.  The
sale of Atari Operations will not have any impact on personnel
at Atari Games or Tengen Inc.  This transaction is subject to
the approval of both companies' boards of directors.  Such
approval is expected shortly.

I'm telling you this now but please keep this information 
Company Confidential until a formal press release has been
issued by both companies.  This formal press release is
expected at the end of next week.

Where does all the rubber go???

You know ... when after about 40 thousand miles you go down to the donut store
(tires) and have a brand new set of radials stretched around your rims.

I'm not talking about the used carcasses which we all know about, but, where
does all the rubber go that used to make up the tread on your tires.  Yes of 
course, it wears off, but where does it go?  You don't see Cal Trans shoveling
the rubber dust off of the shoulders do you?  Does it go into the pavement??
I don't think so.  Does it go into the air we breathe?  I'm sure that
Goodyear Tire and Rubber would like to elaberate on this.

More to think on.

	quiet them down with?

		Besides, hocome the neighbors pets always bring
	their problems to your yard rather than resolving their

		Does anyone have a 12gauge or a pellet gun with
	enough kick to sterilize cats ???
	If so, can I borrow it for a couple of nights ????

Subj:	Canine discrimination  (or "Why are they called man's best friend?")


	I have one for the animal activists.  I can relate to Farrokh's
problem...my solution is to throw a tennis ball at them (I'm not a very
good shot, but they don't seem to like the general idea, and move along
to Farrokh's neighborhood).  It's amazing how rutting cats sound like a
lost two-year old child bawling its head off.

	Anyways, I am a confirmed cat hater.  Kittens are fun, but then
they turn into cats.  My neighborhood is overrun by cats, which doesn't
help my attitude any.  Here is my question:  How come I have to keep my
dog penned up, and can only walk him on a leash, not only near my house
but also almost any publicly accessible area, when cats can go anywhere
they please, not excluding my front yard or roof or garbage cans, which
they seem to prefer empty?  When is the last time you saw a cat and its
owner in the same place?  Does anyone know what a cat leash looks like?

	Aren't you glad that cats and dogs aren't people?  Just what do
you figure would happen to the civil rights movement if some races were
forced to stay inside or be leashed, while others could wander about as
they wanted, doing whatever damage they pleased?  Just a little more of
that "food for thought"...

Farrok,
    Shooting your neighbors pets is completely illegal and you can 
    go to prison for it.  There was a case recently about one of the
    Cosentino grocer's sons who was arrested for shooting cats.

    What you should do is trap the cats and take them to the humane
    society.  They rent traps.  The number is 727-3383.

Subj:	The final chapter 


	 I'm amazed at the number of people who took
	my first message seriously. Ya I'm sure!!
	I used to have a cat myself at one time you
	know. I loved that thing dearly and then One 
	day it disappeared. I wonder of someone shot
	it.
	 Anyways, alot of people have warned me of
	the leagal consequenses of shooting cats and
	killing them.  I suppose it'ld be ok to shoot
	them as long as I don't kill'em.  Who wants
	to have to clean up after dead cats anyway. 
	So you don't have to worry I won't kill'em.

	 Someone suggested that I chase them away 
	with water hose, but that would upset the
	water coservationalists, and don't we have
	alot of them around here! But that's another
	can of worms I don't want to open.  Actually
	I find it rather inconvenient to have to 
	get up in the middle of the night and drag
	out the water hose to spray the annoying cats.
	That doesen't work that well anyway because
	I'm liable to get myself all wet in the process	
	and not be able to back to sleep afterwards.

	 I liked Steve's way of dealing with the 
	problem the best. At least he's the one guye
	who understands me on this one and can see it
	humorously.

	 I'm closing this one with a last request to
	all of you who have a cat and I don't want to
	see this thing develope into some junkmail show
	down (like the enviornmental thing). 

	 So as a final note; IF YOU OWN A LOVELY CAT,
	PLEASE KEEP IT CONFINED TO YOUR OWN HOME. GET IT
	SPAYED AND IF YOU'RE FINDING ITDIFFICULT TO COPE
	WITH DON'T JUST OPEN THE DOOR AND LET IT OUT TO
	TEAR OUT YOUR NEIGHBORS YARD. IT'S NOT THEIR
	FAULT THAT YOU CAN'T DESCIPLINE YOUR ANIMAL.
	
					Farrokh

	PS. You're not automatically assumed to be an
	irresponsible pet owner, so don't take any of 
	this personal unless if you're guilty of the 
	above.

	Does any one out there know of a way to silence a bunch of ruthless
Mocking birds that stay up all night chirpping away just to keep me up at night.
I thought of training my cats to chase them away, but they are too busy
running from the neighbors shot-guns in the evening, so their schedule is full.
Somebody mentioned trying to squirt them with a water hose, but my neighbors
probably wouldnt like me showering a full stream of water against their bedroom
window at 3 A.M. Of coarse they wont be there because they will be in the
garage loading up their shot guns. Maybe we could construct pellet-gun pellets
out of styrofoam thats recyclable. 
	Also, does anyone know how I can keep those word-of-the-day people
from knocking at my door at 8:30 on Sunday. I tried chasing them away with 
my shotgun but they just make sounds of horniness and keep coming back. Someone
mentioned that I could probably try the water hose on them, but if I do this,
I will get all wet and wont be able to get back to sleep at 8:30 Sunday morning
and end up having to watch re-runs of Vic Coburn, the faith healing wonder.
	But I must say that I am NOT a cat hater. Some cats are jerks just
like some people are jerks. But I would like to think that my kitties are safe 
in my neighborhood rather than have to worry about what the neighbors might 
do to them. Its bad enough you have to worry weather they are going to get 
run over by some doehead that insists on driving 65 in a 25. Or that they might
just run away and not leave a note. Or that they might accidentally climb into
somebodys car and accidentally get driven to Gilroy. Now I can better know all
my neighbors for I will have to keep tabs on who in the neighborhood has
insomnia this week.
	Or were you all just kidding?

Subj:	DFM Data Base meeting -- Wed. June 13 -- 2:00 -- Central Conf. Room

         The DFM (Design For Manufacture) project has been broken down
         into sub-committees. I have volunteered to be chairman of the
         sub-committee on data bases.

         The main emphasis of this particular project is to make the
         data bases (MANMAN and AVL) more useful and accessible to the
         design engineers. This includes adding fields to the data
         bases. For example:

              Preferred Part
              EEM (or other standard) commodity code
              Location of reference data sheets

         It also includes designing a screen layout that is useful to
         the design engineer so that he can see in one place all of
         the relevant information that is important to his selection
         of parts.

         It also includes any other areas we agree need improvement.

         Please bring your open minds and your ideas to this meeting.

         Thanks!!

         John

	Before I send this 12 year old friend out to pasture (Goodwill?
Alviso?), I thought I'd check to see if anyone out in VAXland has any interest
in taking it in.  Its gotten a little crotchety in its old age and won't
turn off when you ask it to do so.  Some adjustment also need to be done with 
the automatic play.  Not worth spending $60 - $100 per hour to get it repaired. 
But if you have any mechanical skills, it could be worth your while.  It also
needs a new stylus. 

	Get it while you can, before these things go the way of the hoola-

According to Becky, we could sign a contract with GM to use any of their
car names (including Corvette, Trans Am, others) IF we pay them a fee, and
IF we use excusively GM cars on the game (that means no Ferarri I guess).

Another possiblity is that Peageot (sp?) sounds like they would be willing
to let us use their name for FREE.  But that may not be terribly appealing
to our target market.

Anyway, GM will be sending contracts/releases, etc., as well as a complete
list of all of their car model names to choose from.  

Personally, I'd rather stick to GM as long as the price is not astronomical.

idea to project teams in what we call a 'PITCH SESSION'.  Here's your chance to
let others hear about that great game idea you had at the last brainstorming
session. (AND, just for doing the pitch, your team will receive an incentive of
$100!) 
                 CAN YOU AFFORD TO PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITITY?

	Of course not!  Get your buddies together and stop by Lois Turner's
office for your free Pitch Session Packet. It will outline what a Pitch Session
is and show you how to present your idea.   You must also contact Mary Fujihara
to have a Product Champion appointed to your group.  And, if you require
animation support please see Sam Comstock.

from ninth grade Lit class. of course. In both movies, James Dean plays the

              Tom Smith, John Ray

         Preferred Parts List (PPL)

              We agreed that a PPL is important and that we want to do
              it. It will be an additional data base that is just a
              list of part numbers that are preferred. Designers
              should use parts from this list when reasonable, but
              they may use parts from the "Active" parts list without
              any special approval process.

              We discussed methods for getting parts on to and off of
              the PPL. Rick Meyette and the Components Engineer will
              be involved in further discussions on this topic. The
              ideas that were suggested are:

              The initial PPL:

                   We will generate a list of parts called out on
                   games in production during the last year. Parts on
                   this list will be crossed out by a group of
                   interested people (designers, component engineers),
                   based upon standardizing on RAM speeds, etc. The
                   remaining list will become the PPL.

              Adding/deleting parts to/from PPL:

                   Approximately once per quarter, the interested
                   group will get together to discuss additions and
                   deletions. The candidates for addition are new
                   parts during the last quarter and any other parts
                   the interested persons would like considered.

                   The candidates for deletion are any parts not used
                   in production during the past year and any other
                   parts the interested persons would like considered.

              This procedure should be finalized by July 13. The
              initial list of parts should be generated and reviewed
              by July 27. The PPL should be implemented by August 17.

         Designer's Tools

              There are two phases of design that need to be
              addressed.  The first phase is in searching through the
              data base to see what the possible parts are, and
              tagging those that should be considered in the second
              phase.  For this first phase, we discussed the "Generic"
              field vs.  the "Description" field.  We felt that if we
              could make the Description field consistent and
              complete, we would not need the Generic field.  Tom
              Smith proposed that we look at the IEEE standard for
              descriptions.

              Assuming Component Engineering agrees with this
              decision, I would like to task them to come up with a
              standard for descriptions by August 10. (Ideally, it
              would be an industry standard that is already well-
              documented and de-bugged.) This standard should be
              approved by this committee by August 17.  All new parts
              will be assigned descriptions according to the standard.
              Preferred parts should have the new descriptions (where
              required) by October 1. The remaining parts should
              receive new descriptions on an ongoing basis until
              completed.

              The second phase of design that needs to be addressed is
              in viewing pertinent information about those parts
              selected in the first phase.

              There is a great deal of information useful to the
              designers in the AVL and MANMAN. We discussed ways to
              make this more accessible. Pat McCarthy will put
              together a list of what is available vs. what is
              desired. The interested parties will meet and finalize
              what should be done. Some of the possibilities are:

                   Write a special program for the designers that
                   quickly displays the info. they need.

                   Document the programs that are available so that
                   more people can use them.

                   Pull a subset of the database in to a text file
                   (weekly) that can be searched more quickly than the
                   data base.

              Pat should have his first pass list of available
              programs and desired features by July 9. He should get
              together with the interested parties and come up with
              the desired programs by July 16. Depending on the
              complexity, the programs could be ready by the end of
              August. Additional changes may be requested after using
              the new programs.

              Pat and Mike Jang should work together to determine what
              changes might be necessary to make the programs more
              useful to the Design Services groups.

         MANMAN Engineering

              With a smaller group (Smith, Jackson, McCarthy, Ray), we
              discussed the advantages MANMAN Engineering would
              provide.  The advantages are significant, and Tom Smith
              will document (as he has time) the specific advantages
              that would be beneficial to Atari. The cost is $12,000,
              which seemed to some to be a far better benefit/cost
              than the nifty new paper shredder.

         Please let me know if you feel any dates are unreasonable or
         have any corrections or additions to this summary.

         Thanks!!

         John

Subj:	Our local recycling effort -- even easier


It's come to my attention that a number of people would or do recycle by way
of making piles of cans and/or bottles in their labs, offices, cubes etc.
If you would like your personal stash periodically collected for you, drop
me a mail message, and I'll come around (probably after-hours) and collect them
for our local recycling effort.  Alternatively, drop them in those cleverly 
disguised blue bins marked "GLASS" and "CANS" scattered about the building.
You've probably missed them in the lunchroom. From the perennially empty state
of the bins there, I figure no one can see them.  They're there, just a few
dozen feet from the regular trash cans ... just waiting for you to fill
them up.  You know they want it.

Subj:	SEGA TEST GAME


Sega is testing a coin-op version of their MOONWALKER game at Milpitas
Golfland.  Apparently, they hyped this game quite a bit at the CES for
their home system, but now they may be considering it also for coin-op.

It is a fighting type game (3 player) featuring Michael J. and has 
a special "Dance" button which acts like a super power move...when 
used, Michael breaks into a dance routine and his enemies join in and
get wiped out.  

Per David at AOI, he likes the game despite how corny it is.  Income
is supposedly pretty good.

I would be interested to hear feedback from anyone who does go by to
take a look.

Subj:	Linking games.


Hello

	For our next game we were planning on creating a game
which have the ability to be able to be "Linked" with another
"Link-able" game unit. As we started investigating our communication 
software and hardware options we found others here at Atari were 
planning on making their games "Link-able" or "Linking Freindly".  
We also found that most of these people were not necessarily coming 
up with the same answers.  So..

	There will be a "Linkable Games Conference" 
			Tuesday June 26th
			      in the 
		     Central Conference Room.
			    @ 2:00 pm 
  The purpose is for everyone who is doing a game that communicates with 
other units or has ideas/experience about ways we might all proceed to 
get together and come up with solutions to this.  Why heck if we all get
together we might be able to have it all on one common hardware using 
the same software!

	Please come if you can.

Subj:	New RADMOD release


I've just put a new version of radmod into utl$exe:.  This version:

	- fixes a few bugs dealing with 24-bit TIFF and PICT files.

	- allows the input filename to be specified on the command line.
	  For example, you can now type

			RADMOD BATMAN.PICT
	 instead of
			RADMOD
			BATMAN.PICT

	- Changes a few default responses to be more in line with usage.
		Dither output file is now NO by default.
		CR for data fork or R for data fork now works correctly
		(a CR will really get the data fork) for Pixel Paint files.

	- You can now force a 256 color PICT file to a given palette.

	- The menu color of output RAD files is now set to the inverse of 
	  color 0 so the menus and toolbox in RAD are always visible.

		AUDIO WORKSHOPI

SUBJECT:  Communicating about music.
DATE:	Thursday July,12th
TIME:	2PM

	Music, being a primarily subjective medium, is often difficult to 
discuss.  Because of this, communication regarding music in video games can
be hindered.  WorkshopI addresses this problem by exploring different ways 
musical ideas can be discussed and imparted.  Although it is primarily aimed 
at Project Leaders, Game Designers and Programmers, anyone who's interested is 
welcome.

Please reply via vax mail or phone (3793) if you are interested in attending.

Timing specs for power on reset.
See Johns mail message below for a statemant of the problem.

The Power-on circuit (100kohm/.1uF/2N3506) is not designed to reset the 
microprocessor. It is designed to reset the watchdog counter that resets
the  microprocessor. The RC circuit has a time constant of 10mSeconds 
(which means about 3 mS to a valid logic level). I checked this on the 
wonderful new toy and it is so. POWER-ON comes up about 3mS after the 
5 volts stabilizes. The counter is then cleared and holds the 
microprocessor reset line for 7 video frame intervals, about 116 mS. 
before releasing the Microprocessor on its merry way. The data book 
specifies that a 68000 must have 100mS after stable 5volts before reset 
can be released.
But if you disable watchdog, the counter is disabled, and the 
microprocessor reset line is released on the first VBLANK after POWER-ON 
goes true, i.e. somewhere between 3 and 19mS after the 5 volts stabilizes. 
With this the 68000 is not happy.
So if you want a board to power up happy, either do not disable watchdog, 
or design a more elaborate watchdog circuit. Of course an easy fix would 
be to beef up the capacitor for field test games that want the watchdog 
disabled.

Subj:	Reset circuit


Pat --

The Pitfighter programmers decided to disable watchdog for 
field test because they wanted to hear about it if there were 
any lockups. Unfortunately, the PCB does not reset properly, so 
the game takes several tries to come up. Last week, we assumed 
it was just one board. When two more boards exhibited the 
problem today, I thought we should check into it. Sam had Glenn 
put a much bigger cap on the reset circuit (1uF) and the 
problem went away.

I would guess what is happening is that the reset line is going 
high before the voltages are stable, and the processor tries to 
bring the system up but can't. Should we investigate this 
further and change the values around for the "standard" reset 
circuit so that reset does not go high until the voltages are 
really stable? I'll bet your nifty new scope could find the 
problem pretty quickly (if driven properly).

This may apply to more than the G1 hardware.

John

Subj:	Radial vs. axial capacitors

I talked with Don Wrightnour about what is and isn't auto-insertable and he
said that the machines can only handle up to 0.8" lead spacing. The 47uF
axial capacitor we currently use, 124009-476, has a PCB footprint larger than
this and so can't be auto-inserted. Don also said that where hand insertion is
required, his preference is for radial components.

So . . .  I am going to standardize on a 25 volt radial unit, 123015-476, for
future designs. I'd also like to suggest that we standardize on a few voltages
for electrolytic caps since the board space and cost differences usually
amount to pennies and it would mean stocking fewer parts. 25 volts is a good
number for general use since it gives at least a 30% working voltage margin
in most of our audio circuits.

Subject: 150,000 used books for sale in P.A. (+ some records)
Keywords: books, records, used
Date: 2 Jul 90 21:04:37 GMT

In downtown Palo Alto, maybe 100' South of University on Cowper, an unusual
used book store just opened on Saturday.  It will only exist until 4 August
and is to liquidate the 150,000 used books this man collected, while planning
to open a used book store.  Instead, the story goes, he's taken a job as a
college professor somewhere in Canada, and  doesn't want to take the books
with him.  There are maybe a dozen rooms, with more in the hallways, and the
prices seem more reasonable than at most used book stores.  Lots of pre-sorted
categories, with additional ones being brought out from his bulk storage and
priced/sorted constantly (their sign says only about half are currently
displayed).  If you've been looking for some specific titles, or just like to
browse in such places, you owe it to yourself to check the place out.  They
are open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven days a week, and provide free refreshments,
popcorn, pretzels, corn chips, liquids.  Aside from being a satisfied
customer, I have no connection with the place.  (I just wish I'd been there
Friday night, when they charged $2 admission for the right to buy first.)  

As a minuscule sampling of what the place has to offer, I noticed a 1985
hardback of Samuelson's Economics for $2, more than ten p.b. copies of
Herbert's Dune, five hardbacks of Fixx's running book, more than a dozen
copies of Comfort's The Joy of Sex and Jackson's Color Me Beautiful, some in
hardback, a pocket Chinese-English dictionary as well as a similar one from
Eastern Europe (Czech?), children's books, 20' of shop manuals for a variety
of cars/trucks/cycles, books on planes and flying, hobbies, lots of general
fiction as well as specialized genres: Westerns, SF, mysteries, romances.  I
bought some out-of-print solar energy books, as well as Ian & Sylvia's first
album; I'd been looking for it for a long time.

All in all, a place worth visiting.

	There are ads running on the TV and in magazines & newspapers about the
200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. These ads are awe inspiring in
their statement that although we have had the Bill of Rights all these
years, we must strive everyday to protect those freedoms granted to us in
those few written pages. These freedoms are the basis of everything we call
"American" included the supposed "American Dream". At the end of these ads,
while you are wiping the tear from the corner of your eye, you notice that
the ads are paid for by Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds corporations.
	Well, this changes everything, doesn't it! They are using the Bill of
Rights to protect your freedom to kill yourself with cigarettes. That
certainly trivializes the importance of our guaranteed freedoms.
	It goes deeper than that for me. Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are
the biggest contributors to Jesse Helms (other than Bank of America) in the
country. How does that make you feel about the ads now? Jesse Helms has set
the machine in motion to take away just about every freedom of self
expression and personal choice we have.
	It is very strange how we have allowed these people to use the flag,
the Constitution, and the Bill Of Rights to take away every thing they stand
for.
	They have to be stopped.

2. IMI and other Data I/O 288 moved to printer room. Old space is becoming

	MicroVaxes which produce less heat so the air temp can be raised in the
   	printer room; will also enlarge the printer room at that time.
3. The PAL/PROm programmer is in alpha lab at the Data I/O site.
4. I have complaints that 8 1MEG sockets on a Data I/O is not enough. Please
   note that 8 1MEGs is equivalent to 16 27512's. I do not know of a SET

Subj:	Field Test VCR interface.


There is a new and improved interface to the VCR for field test games. 
(The old interface had the Game emulate the remote control by driving an 
LED.) 
At Tims suggestion, and Minhs implementation the new interface is much 
easier to use. It only required one latched output from the game. A LO out 
means record. A HI out means stop. Power on is taken care of 
automatically, without programmer intervention. If the connector to the 
VCR is disconnected, then the normal VCR buttons and remote control work 
properly. 

One VCR has been modified to accomodate this. The other two (am I right 
that there are three VCRs) will hopefully be done soon. If you are going 
to use this interface, please let the tech. know as soon as possible, as 
it will take time to prepare the VCRs the first time. (A small PCB needs 
to be installed into the VCR).

Thunderjaws used two 20v8s in Rev b production boards. 
Cost price $2.15. 
The raw Atari part number is 137647-025 but we do not buy them blank. The 
programmed part number for Thunderjaws is 136076-1075 or -1076.
Karen can ask Mary Burnias to get some, blank or programmed. We should 
maintain a stock of 100 or so in engineering. 

If you happen to check the price on the computer, it says $1.05. This is 
wrong, and is being changed.

While I have your attention, Mary asked me to pass something on.
Some of the vendors know how many GALs (and other parts) we will need for 
a particular game before Mary does. They then put pressure on her to get 
the full order, making her life difficult (two different vendors can not 
get the full order each). If you are talking to a vendor you should use 
phrases like "The board uses quite a few." and "The game is doing really 
well." instead of saying "It uses 5 and 1000 have been released so far."

No vendor should ever know how many games (past or present) have been 
released or sold. This is sensitive Company confidential information.

the biggest critic around when it comes to games.  

You even have Dennis Wood coming by my office after playing and saying that

Subj:	IN SEARCH OF A PRECIOUS COMMODITY


We are planning to do some filming for a Race Drivin' promotional video
tape tomorrow and I am in need of costuming help.  Customer Service no
longer has Hard Drivin' t-shirts or jackets in stock, so I must appeal to
all you race fans out there in VAXland.

I have asked a few people that have shirts and/or jackets to bring them in
for me to borrow tomorrow, but I need at least two more.  Can you help?

If you have a Hard Drivin' t-shirt or jacket in size Large or Extra Large that 
I can borrow for a day, please respond to this address or call me at X-3788.
I assure you that your shirt/jacket will be returned to you!

Subj:	ADSP question


  I think I'm on the right track, after I replaced the LS245 buffer that's 
tied to PMD16-19 (failing ram locations suggested problems on this bus)
the symptoms changed.
  Now the ADSP 2100 test nolonger runs (before it said that 9E & 10E were
bad) , now it just waits a while and then says:

 	HIGH BANK MEMORY TIME OUT.

  Question_ Does the self test have to read the roms on ADSP in order to
pass this test, or they only matter in the game?

Subj:	ADSP II Tests

I do not know what version of ADSP Tests you are using, but in general
there are two modes of ADSP Tests.

	1. Tests that are run by the 68010. All of the ADSP RAM (Program, Data
	   and Sequential Output) can be tested this way. Note that the RAMs 
	   are tested at 68010 bus speeds which are much slower than ADSP-2100 
	   bus speeds. Graphics ROMs are not accessible to the 68010 bus.

	2. Tests that are run by the ADSP-2100. The ADSP Program and Data RAM
	   are tested this way. Note that if the ADSP-2100 Program RAM is bad
	   it might not be able to run the test program. The program is solely
	   in Program RAM; Graphics ROMs do not contain program and do not have
	   to work to run the tests. However; incorrect ROM data is a major 
	   cause of game program crashes, especially when the ROMs are in the
	   wrong socket.


Let me see if I understand this. You replaced a buffer and now nothing works.

  Thanks for the info. I'll keep digging more, and as far as the tests go

that have been loaned to me as soon as we're done.

Now I have another request.  In order to match the background race footage
we are going to shoot over, we are looking for a driving suit and a helmet.
Does anybody know where we could get one to borrow for a day?  (Preferably
white or light-colored but red would do.)

I tried Frey's, a local shop that rents, but all they have is blue coveralls
that look like something a mechanic wears to work on your car...that's not
the look we want.

Thanks again for your help!

 This message is for all the game designers, programmers,and
technicians who are about to release a new game. 

 This checklist covers some of the most common and deadly pitfalls (BUGS) 
that teams often fall in.  So before release of program and self test roms, 
ask the project tech. or someone who's not directly involved with the game 
to go through this list for you. It might save you from multiple bug-fix 
rom updates.   

  
    SELF-TEST
   
 1. Power up your game with WDOG ENABLED  (WDDIS jumper removed).

 2. Power up in selftest with WDOG ENABLED (WDDIS jumper removed).

 3. Try powering up the game with an uninitialized (fresh) EEROM
   and see if your program can give an EEROM error message or  
   just dies.  
    Now clear stats (initialize EEROM) and exit selftest 
   then go back a while later to ckeck that  error count = 0  .
   
 4. Check RAM and ROM tests for error messages. Sometimes programmers
   reduce the game program roms and forget to reflect the changes in
   self-test roms.



    COIN OPTIONS

 5. Check and double check the operation of your coin options, left
   and right multipliers, as well as the left/right coin-counters.
   Do the coin multiplier options for left and right mech jive with
   your manual.



    GAME PLAY

 6. With only 1 credit attempt to press start switches of more than 
   one player simultaneously.

 7. Now try the same thing with 1 and a fraction of credit. You'll
   have to set multipliers to different coinage settings (1/4 per coin,
   ...).

 * This wraps up my suggested checklist.

Subj:	Sockets for RAMs, PALs,etc.


Manufacturing submitted a deviation to use MACHINED sockets in place 
of stamped sockets for Pitfighter VRAMs because the stamped sockets 
had a16 week lead time. Instead, I deviated out the socket altogether. 
(Machined sockets are 3 to 6 times the price of stamped sockets.) 

There are two reasons for socketing these types of parts.
One  reason is that it is easier to debug boards using the shotgun
method without ruining expensive parts if the more complex components 
are removable.
The second reason is to recover costs from overbuilds. If expensive, 
reusable parts are socketed, these parts can be recovered. This is 
only worth while on the more expensive parts, and if you don't pay an 
arm and a leg for the sockets. The total price for the socket over 
the entire game run (including any overbuild) must be less that the 
totat recovered cost of the socketable parts.
One to three percent of the material cost of a board is sockets,

"It's too hard to say au revoir, so let's just say hors d'oeuvres"
			------------Martin Mull, comic genius

Well, folks, it's time for yet another (sniff) farewell
lunch for one of our beloved.  Deborah Short has answered
the call to riches and fame, and will be moving down to
La-La Land (that other place) to work for Shmisney,
Pisney, Disney---something like that.  We'd like to hold
a good-by for now lunch at Mandarin House restaurant in
Milpitas this Friday at noon.  If you'd like to come to
eat or just look sad, please R.S.V.P. to me A.S.A.P.

I guess so. That is, if there is anything left to take inventory of.

Subj:	new release id scidplot, sdbatchplot and sdplotit


If you don't plot schematics then skip this.

I have released a new version of these programs into SCICOM. If I 
broke something, I'm sure you will let me know real quick.

The main changes are added support for Viewlogic PSEUDO format plot 
files and Houston plotters DMPL format plot files.

I also added a scale parameter. The old method (and current default
method) is that files are plotted at half scale, irrespective of the
scale you requested when you plotted the schematic. Most of the time 
this is what you wanted since you used a D size sheet and wanted a B 
size plot. 
You can now change the scale of the final sheet by using the /SCALE 
switch with SCIDPLOT or SDBATCHPLOT. If you say /NOSCALE then there are 
no overrides, and the scale defined at the schematic tool will take 
effect. If you say /scale=0.4 then your final plot will be reduced to 
this ratio of the sheet your schematic was drawn on. If you want full 
scale use /SCALE on its own or /SCALE=1.0

As always type scidplot on its own for a short help screen.

							Pat.

         ATARI GAMES WINS LAWSUIT FILED BY AUSTRALIAN
                 OVER GAME DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS

MILPITAS, CA  August 8, 1990 - Atari Games Corporation today announced
it has won a jury verdict in a two year old lawsuit brought by 
Australia's largest video game distributor/operator over the right
to exclusively distribute the entire line of Atari Games' arcade
products in Australia.

Avel Pty. Ltd., one of several Australian video game companies owned
by Malcolm Steinberg, filed a lawsuit in September 1988 claiming that
Atari Games had breached an oral and implied contract that would have
given Avel exclusive distribution rights for all Atari products in
Australia for an unlimited period of time.  Atari Games, which had for
many years granted distribution rights to Avel only on a game-by-game 
basis, conuntered that Avel's claims were simply self-serving fabrications.
Avel was seeking $3.6 million inn compensatory damages as well as
unspecified punitive damages.

A two week trial, heard by a jury in the U. S. Federal District Court
in San Francisco, ended on August 2, 1990 with an unanimous verdict
in favor of Atari Games on all claims brought by Avel.

"Atari Games has been a leader in the video game industry for many
years and has excellent long-term relationships with all of its
distributors throughout the world," stated a company spokesperson.

"Atari Games was shockedf and disa
"Atari Games was shockedf and disa
"Atari Games was shocked and disappointed when Malcolm Steinberg
instigated this unwarranted lawsuit to create rights he did not
have.  As an importer/operator, we believe a conflict of interest
existed that had a negative impact on the distribution of Atari
Games product in Australia," the spokesperson said.  Steinberg
admitted during the trial that his companies control sixty percent
of Australia's video game market.

Subj:	More recycling stuff


Information for recycling plastics:

First, buy the right plastics. Look for a triangle symbol with 2 in the
middle. That is the symbol for High density polyethylene (HDPE). Examples of
this plastic are milk jugs and shampoo bottles. A triangle with a 6 in the
middle stands for Polystyrene (P/S). Examples of polystyrene are yogurt and
cottage cheese tubs.

HDPE and P/S can be recycled locally. Waste Management/Recycle America
accepts HDPE at 1140 Campbell Ave, near Newhall Ave and The Alameda in San
Jose. Bay Polymer accepts P/S at 44530 Grimmer Blvd in Fremont. Please make
sure the containers are clean. Otherwise, they will be rejected.

For more information, Waste Management can be reached at 408-980-9900. Bay
Polymer's phone number is 415-490-1791.

There is no cash reward yet for recycling plastic, but you will have the
satisfaction of knowing you're part of the solution to a critical problem.

It appears that not everybody is aware of the situation, so here it

Farrokh has been out on medical leave for over three weeks. He was 
rear-ended in his car and hurt his back and neck. He will be back 
next monday, in all probability. 

However, as you might expect with those types of injuries, he will not
be able to move games or cabinets (in-house or for field test), for

	Would whomever secreted the answering machine in Morgan's area
for safekeeping, please tell me where it is secreted?  I tried to move
it to the computer room to ensure its continued operation, only to find
someone had already taken it to a safe place.  The machine IS (make that
WAS) being used, and IS needed.  Thank you.  I already know Cris didn't do it.
Or Carole for that matter.  And probably not even Tim.  Or Farokh.

	Also, since I have the general ear, I've disconnected the printer
known as CAD$PRINT until further notice (don't hold your breath).  We had
to get it out of the warehouse, and there is no suitable place to install
it.  It is in storage, and will eventually be reconnected in an area somewhat
close to where it is now, once such an area is designated.  Until that time,
CAD$PRINT has been glued to DIO$PRINT (look in the printer room for stuff
that used to come out there).  For those of you who would use CAD$PRINT if
it still existed, continue to do things the same way, and when it is 
reincarnated, everything will work the way you want.

car arena, a shooting gallery, kiddy rides, batting cages, pitching
cages, and SR2 (similar to but much smaller than Disneyland's Star

Subj:	New, improved COSTPL procedure!!


My COSTPL.COM procedure for costing parts lists has been improved as follows
when costing SciCards parts lists with the /SCIPL option: 

1. It now asks you if you want to include assembly part numbers when costing.
The default is NO since these assemblies are usually included as complete parts
lists. (Pat requested this option) 

2. It now recognizez part numbers based on the following criteria:
	- at least 5 digits
	- one hyphen
	- no more than 3 alphas
	- no other special characters
  I believe that this should cover all legal Atari part numbers but if it 
  doesn't, please tell me.

3. It no longer blows up in a nasty fashion if the a part number appears 2 or
more times in the combined parts list. It now totals all occurrences of a part
and combines them into one line.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

 - An option for re-costing an existing xx.COSTPERITEM file using current
MANMAN data. 
 - If one of the standard/current cost columns is zero, the non-zero value will
be substituted and tagged somehow (probably with *).

I am interested in hearing if any of you use this procedure or others that I've
sent out mail about so that I know what level they need to be maintained at. I
am also open to suggestions for any enhancements that you may want.

From the soapbox collection:

	  	" Hazards of a traffic light "

  One might think of the traffic light as a place where one could take
ones feet off the pedals to relax. A place to meditate for a few moments
and briefly converge with other fellow drivers who are willing to wait 
for that beautiful shade of green.  One might also find drivers who 
don't share the same enthusiasm for the peace and serenity that a traffic
light can offer.  One might even get the opportunity to meet such drivers 
and exchange personal data with them.  But these new acquaintances aren't
the type one would run into again in ones lifetime if one can avoid them.
No, ... such meetings can leave painful impressions that can stay with
you for some time. 
  How can one avoid such interaction you may ask.  Well, I'm not sure if
it's totally possible but I'm going to practice the following:

1. Avoid the open lanes in an intersection. I know it's tempting to drive
   on to the open space and assume the pole position, but it's not worth 
   it. Leave that lane open for the drivers who aren't particular about 
   traffic signals color codes.
2. Always tow one of those giant spot lights behind your car (the kind
   that car dealers use to shine on the sky on special sales and grand 
   openings).
3. And this one is not all that practical but on some occasions you might
   just put the car in park and wait in the sidewalk for the green so if
   anyone should rearend your car, you can be a bystandard and act as a
   witness in your case. 

  If you have additional suggestions on ways to avoid rearend collision
at the red light, or would like to warn me on other possible hazards of
the traffic light, please forward your comments to this vax address.

Subj:	Tomorrow's Hits


Holy Pitfighter! Look at the Ramparts on that stunt track! What's a
helicopter doing in that BMX race? And remember to toss the shoes, not
the horse. Well, those are all yesterday's games from the perspective of a
Brainstorming session. Did I say Brainstorming? Yes indeed. We're having a
true blue knock down slam bam died in the wool Brainstorming session this 
Year. The format includes several concurrent in-house sessions on the same 
day. This is followed by an off-site session several days later. Off-site  
participants will spend 2 days/nights in the ultra-creative environment of 
the Santa Cruz Mountains at the Boulder Creek Lodge and Conference Center.   

   IN-HOUSE SESSION:   Tuesday, September 11,1990 (about 2 weeks away)
   IN-HOUSE RSVP Due:  Thursday, September 6,1990
	To RSVP, Send Downend a 10-20 line game idea description.
   Off-site session:   September 30 - October 2, 1990
	Space is limited so only a subset of the in-house participants
		will be able to attend the off-site session.

Themes are likely to focus on video, but any ideas for a coin-operated
entertainment product are welcomed and encouraged. Here are several
topics, themes, technologies as food for thought:
	
   - Virtual Reality (vision output & player-motion sensors that simulate
				an environment)
   - vechicle simulation ( ala Hard Drivin)
   - CD ROM
   - Growth motion object H/W (allows zoom, cinematic camera effects)
   - Digitized graphics, photo-realistic looks 
   - Movie Themes
   - Traditional Themes ( sports, driving, space, kick/punch, walk/shoot)
   - Redemption
   - Electro-mechanical
   - Puzzle solving
   - role playing
   - Pop Culture themes (TMNT, New Kids OB, Simpsons etc) 
   - Multi-player (required unless game has the WOW for $.50 play)
   - Multi-player networked (multiple screens w/1-2 players per scrn)

Subj:	Help me, help me!!!!


	Could someone explain to me what happens to the little doodads
that convert telephone-style cords to the DB25 connectors commonly found
on computer equipment?  We're not talking one lost sock in the dryer, here.

	It seems that every time a terminal gets moved, or an AMS, or even
an Arium, the cords and adapters vanish.  When we move an AMS, that's $30
in parts.  Every time.  I really don't begrudge the first set, and even
occaisional replacements seem worthwhile.  Cords are sometimes too short (and
then where do they go???) or are strung up on the ceiling and not worth the
effort to get down.  Fine.  I expect to relace line cords now and again, and not
always have a trade-in.  But who is collecting these things?  Most of them
have had at least 3 sets made, and some have gone through as many as 8.
By this time, if the parts are being saved for "if I ever get it back,"
I still shouldn't have to make connectors (cords, OK).

	A general plea:  Unless we are sending the box outside the company
(as in repairs), PLEASE leave all the adapters ON THE BOX.  We're talking
terminals, AMS, Ariums, etc.  I've been making an effort to screw them on
to help their longevity...and the attachment points have started disappearing
because they get unscrewed.  If you're giving up an AMS, for example, the 
connectors won't do you any good, and the next guy will really need them,
just as bad as you did.  So please, make my job easier, and yours, and even
save the company the cost of quite a few Xerox's.

	The soapbox is open.  Next?

Subj:	ImageWriter II now available to AppleTalk


For all you Appletalk users out there:

	There is now an ImageWriter II hooked into the Appletalk network that
all you should be able to print on.  It is located in the ASAP development lab
(across from Mike Albaugh's and Jim Morris' offices).  

	To use, Select the Chooser from the Apple menu on your Mac, then select
the AppleTalk ImageWriter icon (looks like a printer with a wire coming out of
the bottom).  The "ASAP lab ImageWriter" should then show up in the upper-right
hand box.  Make it highlighted if it isn't already, then select the goaway box
(square in upper left corner of the title bar).  Now you can print.

Note: You PacerShare users will probably have to change from EtherTalk to 
LocalTalk before doing the above.  To do this, Select the Control Panel from
the Apple menu, and choose "Network" from the control panel.  A couple of icons
will appear (LocalTalk and EtherTalk and possibly EtherTalk2).  Pick the
"built in" icon.  Now do the Chooser stuff from above to print.  When you are 
done printing, be kind to the rest of the users and switch back to EtherTalk 
(not EtherTalk 2)  EtherTalk icon looks like a pair of arrows pointing in
opposite directions, while the Ethertalk 2 icon is similar, but each arrow has
2 arrowheads instead of one.

If this stuff doesn't work for some reason, let me know and I'll install the 
necessary stuff on your Mac.

Subj:	New/Improved ATARI$AVL:SEEALL


         Introducing the all new and revised ATARI$AVL:SEEALL

SEEALL is a fast, convienient way to get AVL, USAGE, COST, STOCK, WHEREUSED, and
PURCHASE ORDER information about an part.  The user may configure SEEALL
to report only those items which are of interest.

SEEALL only works on node MIKE.  To use SEEALL, at the system prompt ($) type:

                       RUN ATARI$AVL:SEEALL

SEEALL will look for a file named SEEALL.INI in your default directory, if it
doesn't exist, SEEALL can create it using user-selectable options.  

You can change your default configuration or output-file from within SEEALL by 
entering the word SETUP or OUTPUT at the "Atari Part Number [EXIT]:" prompt.

You can also define a logical word in your LOGIN.COM to run SEEALL, such as:

                   SEEALL :==$ATARI$AVL:SEEALL

this would allow you to use several different config files with SEEALL by 
entering:
                      SEEALL [config-file]

at the system prompt ($).


If you want to create or modify your own config files, the syntax is simple,
just enter the options you want, in any order, at the left margin of your
ASCII config file, leaving the remainder of the line blank.

Your choices are:

	USAGE		lists the parts current period usage (6/1/89-TODAY)
	VENDORS		lists the approved vendors for the part
	STOCK		stock status
	WHEREUSED [n]	the parts where-used report
	PO [n]		purchase orders for the part
 
where n = the maximum iterations of the function you wish to have performed,
the default is to list all WHEREUSED or PO references.

Blank lines or lines not containing a valid option are ignored.

here's a sample config file to show a little of everything;

USAGE
VENDORS
STOCK
WHEREUSED 3
PO 2

I am rewriting PBCONVERT from FORTRAN to C and need your help.  There
are now 23 formats supported by PBCONVERT, and I'd like to prune away the 
obsolete ones.  

Please send me a list of the formats you use, or think should be retained.  
Those formats not listed by anyone will not make the transition to the new

Jed,

    The one line change I was refering to is in [bike.cycle.stest]gsptst.asm.

    I went looking for remaining data which wasn't in those ROMs.  I didn't
    find any which overflowed into the last pair of 512's.  So, I repeated the
    test by filling RAM with 0's, checking  that their checksums were indeed
    0000, and running selftest.  Only this time when I flipped the selftest
    switch to gamemode, the game came up.  Farrokh had to leave.  We'll try
    it again tomorrow afternoon.

* It's a very good polygon hardware with a helicopter fire-fight theme.
* Please minimize rewinds, slow scans, etc. since the tape is a VHS-C inside
   an expander cartridge so the tape is all pulled out on several rollers...
* You have to put up with serious sync bars since they update they screen
   much slower than 60HZ.

I hadn't been to the local arcade for a few weeks... from afar the excitement
mounted as I saw a yellow cabinet next to Hard Drivin'... sure enough,
"Race Drivin'" is out.  This is a sequel to Hard Drivin', the ultimate road
racing simulator from Atari Games.

You can choose the original classic course, a rallycross course, or a Super
stunt course.  The rallycross course is very short, and seems kinda dull.
You drive around on a flat course with marker cones (which I think make a
"squop" sound if you hit them).  There are some barricades, but I couldn't
smash through them.

The Super stunt course is wild.  It starts with a banked turn, then you 
cruise up into a vast bleak green mountain, which the road winds around.
Fortunately there are no other cars on this track.  There are some very
sharp (40 mph) corners, but unlike on the flat where running wide just
slows you down, on the mountain you drift outta line and . . . . your
clothes would be out of fashion before you hit the bottom [[I stole this
quote from a "car" magazine article about rallying with Stig Blomqvist]].
And if you nose into the mountain, the car does a Euclid-defying instant
flip and you're falling. . . . .  There are two cows by the road you can
crush, some more turns, then it's a steep descent off the mountain.  You
can really build up speed.  Next up is a split jump.  There's one take-off
ramp, but two landing ramps, one for 90mph, the other for 115 or so.  It's
really hard to land on the fast ramp.... more spectacular crashes.

Then a really steeply banked turn.  The transitions coming into and out of
this are so abrupt that they usually pitch your car right over. . . . but
as in the original, the car often bobs to the ground unhurt.

You've been on the track for 2 1/2 minutes, but there's more to come.
Zoom past SAM'S Bar, and into a huge loop with an inverted jump in the
middle (i.e. the top of the loop is missing).  This is spectacular to see
in the distance, but not very exciting for the driver.  You just don't
feel like you're flying upside down.  Time to license the Sega spinning
ride technology...

There's more.  You blast into a double loop which corkscrews off to the left,
just like a roller coaster ride.  It's one lane with no guard rails, so one
false move and you are flying. . .  The feeling of the suspension and steering
going through this is glorious.

Continuing the roller coaster theme, there's a near vertical climb to a flat
area, and then an immediate sheer drop.  The drop is so steep you lose contact
with the ground.  If you ever wondered what it's like to drive a Ferrari F40
off a cliff, check it out.  I stalled the car and restarted it as I hurtled
to earth.

Then there's a tunnel.  But I have no idea what happens in the tunnel.  I
think it's the last thing on the course, according to the map.  No one got
that far all evening.


You get to pick your car from an auto sportster, a manual sportster, a manual
roadster (no top) and a manual speedster.  I think the sportster is the 
car from Hard Drivin'.  I *think* the roadster is lighter, more nervous
handling, but I might be imagining it.

As well as the three courses, there were some other courses for "duels"
which were crossed out on the unit I tried.  I think that if an arcade
has two of these, you can race a friend.  This should be great for setting
up incredible crashes, like two cars smashing in mid air, or one landing on
top of another.


As you can tell, I think this is a sensational game, well worth a $.  I have
some questions about the world it presents.  Is there anything interesting
to do on the rallycross track?  What's the best car for the Super stunt track?
What's the multicolored building added to the original track from Hard 
Drivin?  Are there any secret sounds to be made?  Can you drive into any of
the buildings in this game (e.g. the bar, the service station, etc.).  If
anyone has some spectacular crashes, let me know.  If anyone has tips for
getting onto the fast jump ramp, or for making it through the second banked
turn without flipping, please let me know.  What happens in the tunnel?

I know some people from Atari Games read this group.  First, congratulations
on a stunning, sensational, fabulous game.  Did you drive cars through loops
and across ramps at 115 mph to get the game right?
I wish there was a way to make the instant replay show more time.  Many of
the crashes take 10 or more seconds before impact, so the replay just shows
a car spinning out of control in space.

Bicycle in real life, Race Drivin' at 7 miles per gallon in fantasy life --
take that Saddam!

Subj:	KIM gets new guts


The only constant here at Atari, is change...

Beginning the first week in October (next week in case you're not looking):

CHARM will be history. KIM will have been reincarnated as a new micro-vax 3800.
It'll have 48Mb of memory and except for a disk, a 9-track tape drive and an
ethernet interface, it'll have no other peripherals. A microvax 3800 is rated at
3.8 times that of a 780, which is what old KIM and CHARM are. I believe this
may improve the VAX responsiveness somewhat.

All the terminals, printers, devsys's, etc. that were connected directly to KIM
or CHARM instead will be plugged into what is known as a "terminal server". The
terminal server plugs into the ethernet thereby giving all engineering terminals
a "soft" connection to any Vax or Unix system on the ethernet. You will need
to know how to use the server, so I recommend you read the file

	DOK:TERMINAL_SERVER.DOC

I'd have mailed it, but I wanted to keep this message short and to the point.

Subj:	System down time


We are going to do some major work in the computer room this coming weekend.
This involves recabling terminal, power and network connections. As a result,
ALL of the systems will be down ALL day saturday (9/29) and very probably
all day sunday too.

The biggest job for us is the removal of the two older engineering Vaxes and the
re-installation of a  new one. In an effort to see to it that the engineering
computers are up and running monday morning 10/1, I will need to take them down
friday evening. The following schedule approximates what will be available:

	Before	After	
	5pm	5pm	
System	9/28	9/28	9/29    9/30    10/1
------	-----	-----	-----	-----	-----
MIKE	Up	Up	Down	Down	Up
ERNIE	Up	Up	Down	Down	Up
BERT	Up	Up	Down	Down	Up
SANDY	Up	Up	Down	Down	Up
ICY	Up	Up	Down	Down	Up
GAWD	Up	Up	Down	Down	Up
KIM	Up	Down	Down	Down	Up
CHARM	Up	r.i.p.	----------------------->
BIB	Up	r.i.p.	----------------------->

I can't guarantee that this schedule will be followed exactly and I don't
want to cripple our efforts by promising much more than the systems
will be up on 10/1/90.

Two new Sega pieces look interesting, as seen in new European trade mag:

1.  GP Rider - 2 monitor motorcycle racing game.  Plays like many of their
other racing games with very little new or exciting.  Supposedly getting
good word of mouth over in Europe.  This was testing in upright version
at Milpitas Golfland last week and may still be there.  Advertisement show
(shows) a cabinet with two motorbike seat units (similar to Four Trax seats).

2.  Ghost Hunter - Another 2-monitor game but this one has an interesting
twist....the monitors are superimposed and accomodates 3 players (2 seated
and one standing in middle).  The superimposed monitors are suppose to give
a good 3D effect.  

Also heard from the field that Namco may be showing a Rolling

Even more changes.

If you haven't noticed, the IMI and DIO have moved to the cubicle closest

All 3 DIO's and the IMI and their respective terminals are connected to
the terminal server. This means they can be operated from any Vax and are
therefore "connected" the vax that you login to. Otherwise, they ought
to behave the same as before.

     I need to get a copy of Race Driving Aromrel.doc. I checked in 
both [driving.raceversions.romreva] and [driving.raceversions.romrevb]
and don't see the file. I looked at the versions.doc file, but it's not 
the one I need. Can you help? 

                                                        RLO

I moved AROMREL.DOC to [DRIVER.RACEVERSIONS]AROMREL.DOC

The other choices were:

	Have a different AROMREL.DOC in each ROMREV_  directory
		or
	Remember to put the same AROMREL.DOC in each directory each
	time it was changed.

AROMREL.DOC contains all ROMs released for that project.

I also keep a copy of it in my directory [MARGOLIN.RACE].

I received a call today from a local Warlords fan who would like to 
find a game to purchase.  If you have a Warlords game and would like
to sell it, you can contact Steve Moser directly at (xxx) xxx-xxxx.

I have no further information regarding the price he is willing to pay
or anything else.  The fireball is in your court, you can catch it or
put up your shield.

Decode this secret message and you may win big bucks:

This month's walk-about is being hosted by a most happenin' muchacha, Bonnie,
who is working on the way aggro BMX game that most of you have probably checked
out before.  Make sure you plan a session in her lab this Friday between 3:30
and 5:30, have some fast fun and tell Bonnie what you think the game should be
called.

While playtesting the game, the kids at the focus thrashed the scoot, some even 
bailed, but Jacques the Ripper (that rightous dude) has made the ride fresh and 
buffed again.  So spec it out!  Dial in on a name for this game and get some 
fest money.  And don't bogue!  Wear your street garb and grind the game while 
you're in the lab.  Try some way aggro moves.  Lampin' the box is encouraged, 
so get clockin'!!!

(boom, boom!)

                H-h-h-hey, delbert; don't be lame.  
                Y-y-y-you gotta name the game!
(boom!)

                Put on your helmet,
                Don't get tweaked!    (boom!)
                                      
                It's aggro, gnarly
                You'll get freaked!

                           F-f-f-freaked, freaked, f-f-f-freaked!

(b-b-b-boom, boom...boom, boom!)

So, don your skid lid and take a ride.  Go vert.  Intense!  'Core to the bone!
Come catch some hospital air in the lab where it's safe.  Thank Bonnie for the 
radical grub, tell her what you think of the game and give her some ideas for 
a name.


The creative heads will decide on which names to submit for legal approval.
The weak ideas will be shelved and hot ones will be rewarded handsomely.

Subj:	audio board standard upgrade/update.


We are going to phase out the JSAII audio board and the SAII audio 
board. JSA-III will replace JSAII for Jamma compatable piggy back
audio boards, and SA-IIS will replace SAII for true stand alone
non-jamma applications.

JSA-III : 
This will be like JSAII except -
. Banking will be added to the ADPCM ROM area to double the 
  capacity. Four Mbits of memory will be available either as 4 1-Meg 
  EPROMS or 1 4-MEG mask ROM.
. SCOM will be removed. The main cpu upper data bus (d15-d8) and the 
  two status flags will go to the audio board through the 40 pin 
  connector. A simple parallel port will be implememted on the audio 
  board. 
. The volume pot will be changed to a more standard / readily 
  available type, probably with a linear taper.
. The 40 position connector will probably be changed to one that does
  not require hand soldering.


SA-IIS
This will be like SAII except -
. Stereo output will be provided.
. Banking will be added to the ADPCM area just like JSA-III.
. The volume control will change, possibly eliminated and replaced 
  with a digital volume control, adjusted only in self test.

Note that SCOM will stay on this board.

BATMAN and G1.1 (RAT-RACE) will be the first games using JSA-III.
Cyclotron and/or NONAME may use SA-IIS.
Other games that do not need a seperate processor for audio are unaffected.

I know that we used to have a Plant Lady (presumably from the Plant

Subj:	Designer Tools Demo -- Thursday -- 2:00 or 3:00 -- Central C.R.


In our DFM meeting a while back, we identified some 
improvements to designer's tools. Some of these improvements 
have been made. We need YOUR feedback on if the improvements 
are sufficient, and what other tools are still required.

I would like your feedback by the end of October. In order for 
you to be introduced to the tools (and to know what exists), 
Pat McCarthy has offered to give two demos on Thursday 
afternoon:

	2:00 ID, Mechanical, Harness
	3:00 Electrical

In the two weeks following the demo, I would ask that you try 
out the tools introduced and think about what would make them 
better and what other tools are desirable. I will reqest your 
feedback at the end of the month.

I will assume that you will be at the meeting unless I hear 
from you.

Mike and Jerry -- feel free to invite other members of your 
department. 

Carole -- feel free to invite Stevie (you were the DFM rep.)

Thanks!!

John

Subj:	Use the JAMMA START Inputs!!


We just got burned in yet another way on Pit-Fighter. I am 
writing this message to you in hopes that you will take the 
time now to keep this same problem from biting you when you 
sell your game to Japan.

On the game we build in the U.S., we use Kick, Jump/Start, and 
Punch buttons for each player. The standard Japanese game
cabinets have 3  action buttons (A,B,C) and one Start button for
each player.  Konami has asked us to change the PCBs so that the
Start buttons  on their control panel start the game. (The start
buttons come  in to the Jamma connector on 17 and U.)

What the hardware guys should do: make sure the Start buttons 
(17 and U) can be read by the microprocessor.

What the software folks should do: make sure you read the Start 
buttons (in addition to any buttons you are already reading for 
Start) and Start a game if appropriate. That way, it will work 
in the U.S. as well as in Japan.

Let me know if you need help deciphering this!

...maybe I should have used the "I shouldn't leave my terminal unattended"
excuse too.

I apologize to all who might have been offended by my "lamb's head" comment.
I did not mean it to be insulting to any particular group of people, so please
excuse my ignorance.

There are several people here that attended a dinner at a Greek restaurant in
Chicago who watched a certain member of our group order a lamb's head and
eat it for dinner.  My remark was intended to be a reflection of my own
personal taste relative to another individual's personal taste.  Thank 
goodness ice cream is made in many different flavors!!!

I certainly do not want to cause World War III here at Atari; so again,
I accept complete personal responsibility for my actions and please accept 
my personal apology.

remind everyone that during those hours there will be:

	NO Telephone service in either 675 or 735.
	NO computer services in either 1623, 675, 735 or via modem.
	NO outside access to 675 

In preparation for this, I plan on shutting off the computers on friday
at about 9pm. They will be backup and running late in the afternoon on
Saturday.

So, please, please, please don't call me saturday morning to tell me the
computer doesn't work. I'll know that already.

    So, we had a junk mail message this week that was offensive. ..........

	We seem to have a new policy here at Atari to make a new policy when
ever someone steps over the invisible line. I hope that doesn't happen in
this instance. We should not let one person ruin a good thing for the rest
of us. I believe that junk mail is a valuable vehicle for expounding ideas,
venting frustration, disseminating worthless information, selling our extra
A's tickets, and whatever else.
	Humor at the expense of another is rarely good humor. We can only be
our own judge as to what is in good humor and what falls into poor taste.
	After an incident like this one comes an eerie junk mail silence. I say

Milpitas, San Jose area.  I bought a cord of wood in 1981, of very difficult to
burn Oak. I'm down to my last three logs. Possibly you could recommend wood that
might be easier to burn.

                 Thanx,   Tom Smith

Subj:	Audio Regulator II board


Jed,
	I have been asked by Bob Flanagan and Tim Hubberstey to hook the 
Marble Madness in Bobs lab so that we can switch the operation from stereo
to mono audio. So, Hubberstey went and picked up the latest version of the
System I manual, marked it up and asked me to cover it. But what Bob has is
not an SA II like he has marked up. It is not even an Audio Reg. III.
What he has is an audio regulator two that has been modded. I think the audio
section is untouched in terms of the original PCB layout design. My question
to you is, is this audio considered to be "stereo"?

				Thanks in advance

				Cris

Subj:	401K -- GIC vs. Money Market


A year or so ago, you all expressed interest (pun intended) in 
a Money Market Fund as one of the choices for the 401k plan. 
Since then, I have learned that:
	a) Neither the GIC Fund nor the Money Market Fund are 
backed by the government
	b) Wells Fargo will only allow Atari to choose one of 
these two funds

So I am asking you if you have a strong desire to replace the 
GIC Fund with the Money Market Fund. If you do, then we will 
have to ask all fund participants if they would like to make 
this change (and see if the majority wants a change).

Let me know if you strongly desire the change or strongly 
oppose the change. I will assume you don't care if I don't hear 
from you.

TI has a new 'A' version of 1Meg EPROMS. They are marked 27c101A
They allow use of the SNAP agorithm. We got a bunch (5000) in stock, 
so some may make their way to engineering. Our programming equipment 
probably will not recognise the electronic signature I.D. for these 
parts, DATA I/O says January availability.

TI says that if you disable the auto select in the programmer, and 
tell the programmer that it is an Intel 27c010, that it will program 
OK. 

The notice from TI is posted at the programmers.

Subj:	Your right to moan and groan freely


	I am pleasantly surprised by the lack of political noise being
broadcast from the SYS$MAIL:JUNK soapbox.  At the risk of ruining a good
thing, there's something I think must be said.

	Eventually, the fear of broadcasting will again wear off, and the
usual contributors will be back, followed by the occaisional contributors.

	I simply want to point out that when that time comes, if you do not
exercise your right to vote, you have no moral nor ethical right to complain
about the results.  For those of you living in a cave (without a radio or TV),
and those who forget to wear shoes that match each other (mostly engineers
and programmers):  TODAY IS THE DAY.  VOTE.  Because you WILL live with the
consequences.

ROM 7 (a pair of 27512s) on the MultiSync Board is accessed through a
Slapstic at 200K.

The DSK Board has a pair of 27512s accessed through a Slapstic at 10A
and a pair of 27512s/27C010s that are not Slapstic'd.

Slapstics are not available anymore since the company that made them
threw out the masks.

The ones remaining in stock are being used for production games. As far as
I know there are no plans to do new ones.

If you need one or two I can supply them. This does not sound like a good
long-term solution to your memory requirements.

The Bi-CMOS from TI (the 74BCT29823NT) not only works but produces
a slightly sharper picture on the monitor.

I have submitted a CER and when I get the Atari pn I will ask Art
to ECN the parts list for Compact and Cockpit to use this new part.

I have evaluated the Signetics 74F823 and it will also work. It is
as good as the 74AS823 but is not as good as the 74BCT29823. The
Signetics part is already on the AVL under another number which I
do not have at hand just now.

The preferred part will be the 74BCT29823NT. The 74AS823N (TI) and 
74F823N (Signetics) can also be used if necessary.

It's time to start thinking about Christmas!!
Need a gift, or something to decorate your own house?
I've got the solution!  At my desk I have handmade
Mr & Mrs Santa Claus dolls. The cost is $25.00 each.
You can buy them as a couple or separately. I'm taking
orders now and they'll be ready in early December.
Come over and take a look at them, they're really
cute!!

Subj:	Use the Aux. Coin Sw.


Hello --

It's me again with another suggestion to keep you from getting 
burned when your game goes to Japan.

Besides the Start switches (see prior memo a couple of weeks 
ago), you should also provide for the Aux Coin or Service 
switch. This switch (Jamma pin R) should give a credit to the 
game without clicking the coin counter. I believe the standard 
software can handle this -- provided that all of the correct 
software "switches" are set.

I suggest you implement this by Field Test so that you have 
plenty of time to make sure it works before release (and any 
protos going to Japan would work properly).

That's all for now. Sayonara!

John

	 I encourage you to vote for the Money Market Fund.

	ADVANTAGES:

		1. Your principle is guaranteed by the U.S. Government

			instead of by an insurance company.

		2. The fund has out performed the GIC in the last

			2 years.

	In these times of economic uncertainty, my feeling is that it is
	better to play it safe.  If you have any other comments, i'd be

Subj:	models & associated paperwork


Several projects are in the process of digitizing live models for
animation/attract screens.  If this applies to you OR may apply to
you in the future, please note the following procedure for paperwork...

Three forms are involved:

   1) RELEASE FORM:  this form gives Atari legal rights to the use of
      the model's image and/or voice.  Each project may have special
      circumstances (Ex. Cyclotron used minors, requiring an extra
      line for the parent to sign).  Consequently, ALWAYS get your
      release form DIRECTLY from Berry Kane.  The completed form should
      be xeroxed (you keep xerox, Berry gets original).

   2) W-9: for tax purposes.

   3) CONTRACTOR INVOICE:  essentially, a timecard.  Both the W-9 and
      the Contractor Invoice can be obtained from Lois.  Xerox completed
      forms.  You keep copy, Lois gets originals (attach W-9 and Invoice).
      She will deliver the completed forms to finance for payment.  It
      takes 2-3 weeks for payment (be smart - tell your model 4 weeks).

Regardless who does the paperwork, the project leader is ultimately
responsible for it's completion.

The above forms are not necessary when the subject is an Atari Employee.
When dealing with agencies, payment is made to the agency who then pays
the model.  For information on the purchase/rental of props & costumes,
refer to Rob Rowe.

     Gentlemen:
   Our current production schedule in PCB requires the availability of 
this programmed part in greater quantities than has been heretofor available
to us.  I know that I initially asked Rick to support us to the tune of about
75 parts a day, however at this time it appears that I underestimated our
usage. I would like to request approximately 120 parts daily if possible,
and in particular I would like to get as many as possible today.  If we
in production can supply any manpower that would help to expedite this process
please say so and we will happy to oblige.  Thanks for any and all support
you can give me in this matter (Atari p/n 137665-200).

                     Regards,
                     Rob

p.s.  As of this morning, Nov. 28 AM, we have received a total of 734 parts
      from you.

Subj:	So you are having MAIL problems, eh?


An important MAIL file was destroyed today (wednesday) so I restored it
from a copy made on tuesday night.

Among the things stored in this file is your NEW MAIL COUNT. This means
that your count of new mail messages will no longer be in synch with your
actual mail message count. What you may get is a message at login saying
you have new mail, but you actually don't or it'll say you have 3 messages
when you only have one (for example).

To fix this problem, type READ/NEW while at the MAIL> prompt and ignore
any error messages you might get (such as "...no new mail..."). This
will reset the new mail count to its correct value.

If you made any changes today to your personal mail environment such as
forwarding,personal name, mail directory, etc. (Any of the things you can set
with a SET command), they will have been lost.

I don't know why the mail file got wiped out. It probably was a result of
the very disturbing system crashes that are happening with increasing frequency.

Finally at long lost I can recommend a movie on TV.  Tonight on channel
36 at 8 pm "Trip to Bountiful" is being broadcast.  Geraldine Page won an 
Oscar for her portrayal of an old woman who wants to return to her home
on last time.  I loved this movie.

Then this weekend trip on down to the best popcorn in town at Camera 3
and see "To Sleep with Anger" starring Danny Glover. Now is the time
to see it, not later when Glover wins the Oscar and the line gets long.

Four are 25" family cabinets to be built in Ireland. 

We are supplying (6) PCB's altogether: 
	(1) PCB is to ship with the 33" module - Ireland needs it to test
						  the 4 they are building
	(5) PCB's will be hand-carried in early January to equip the

          Due to conflicts arising from the Atari Games/Tengen Christmas
          party on the evening of Friday, December 7, and in response to
          popular demand, we have changed the date originally planned for

          You are all now cordially invited to come for refreshments, door
          prizes and a tour of our new facility during our "Christmas Open
          House" on Friday,  December 14, 1990, from 3:30 - 5:30 p.m .

Subj:	CELPROCESS update


I put a new version of CELPROCESS in UTL$PPS: which expands on the /XDEF
command.  The new format of /XDEF is 

		/XDEF = num [[, first], format]
	where:	[]'s  represent optional values
		num	= the XDEF value as before
		first	= 1 to limit XDEF to the first label only, 0 otherwise
		format	= a printf-type format string to use for the label
			  text (defaults to "section %d")

Also with this change comes the ability for you to specify any numeric values
in octal or hex.  An octal number is assumed if the number begins with '0'
(zero), hex is assumed if the number begins with '0x' or '0X'.  Let me know
if this causes great tragedy.

Merry Christmas Everyone!

If you would like to buy a Sega Genesis or any Genesis carts, this is your big 
chance. We have a complete wholesale price list from Sega, and will be placing 
an order next week. I expect to get delivery in about a week.

To place an order, call Lisa at the Tengen direct order desk (extension 491). 
Lisa will tell you the price, or you can come back to Siberia (TENGEN) and 
visit her in person and get a copy of the entire price list. You will need to 
give Lisa a check or charge card number by Wednesday December 12 so that we can 
place one large order for all of Tengen/Atari Games.

	Did anyone but myself and former Atarian, Paul Mancuso, receive a notice
from the IRS reguarding an alleged IRA distribution from Warner Communications
for the 1988 tax year?  Supposedly a 1099 was issued, but I didn't ever cash any 
such check!  Was this a computer glitch from the last months power failure on
Wall Street or ?   
I don't even have an IRA account.

Everyone who worked for Atari in 1985 will probably receive this notice from
the IRS. It concerns the distribution of stock from the Warner ESOP (Employee
Stock Option Plan) that was distributed that year. You will also receive a
follow-up letter from an accounting firm stating that they supplied the IRS
erroneous information concerning this distribution (a 1099 form stating the
distribution was done in 1988).

You are still obligated to respond in writing to this letter from the IRS and
dispute the proposed increase in taxes for that year. I sent them copies of the
1985 1099 from Warner for this distribution and a copy of my income tax return
for 1985 to show that I claimed the distribution.

	You have heard the rumors!  So now is the time to come and play

	we have NOT even placed it in the common area.  You must come to

	outside Marble II/III, Danger Express, and Rampart.

	Come and bring a friend and blow him out of the sky with your
	dazzling flying skill.  Or stop by and learn the basic controls
	and skills of flying a helicopter.

	As always should you get caught finding a bug, the team will
	disavow any knowledge of your actions.  But in any case write your
	comments down or come find Ed Rotberg or myself.

	You will have until this afternoon before this game is moved into

	Well, now it's my turn to vent my anger at some anonymous
low-life. I was wandering through the common area and saw a new
issue of "Machine Design". "Hmmm", I thought to myself, "I haven't
gotten my copy of that issue yet". Imagine my surprise on picking it
up to discover it _was_ my copy. No only that, but the person who
presumably took it from my mailbox (and didn't bother to return it
there) also folded over a few pages, and tore out at least one more.
I might think those were shipping damages, but the note:

	Sherry
	415-838-0184
	___________
	Find Devsys

was almost certainly not put there by the publisher or the post office.
I am glad to share my magazines and if asked will put you (whoever you are,
yes still) on my informal "distribution list", but I would like an apology
and if I catch someone doing this again (_after_ Christmas, when I'm in a
worse mood) I'll rip your lungs out, hear?

				Mike

P.S. I toyed with the idea of petty little things like calling Sherry
and finding out who she knows at Atari, or leaving out the number so
you'd have to see me, but hey, I'm normally a decent guy :-)

Subj:	Laser Printers


This is an offical announcement of the retirement of the NEC spinwriter (aka
LQ0, aka TTQ3) and the Diablo 630 (aka IT, aka TTR3). YEA!!

The replacements are QMS PS410 postscript laser printers. They are connected
to Appletalk and can take files from the Vax and the Mac's simultaneously.
These printers are fairly smart. They try to sense whether the data to be
printed is postscript or HP LaserJet II so they can do the correct emulation.
The problem is, many of the files that we normally print look an awful lot
like postscript (lots of #'s, /'s, { and }'s and %'s). I thought I could get
away with not having you have to specify whether the file you are printing is
a postscript file or just a plain text file but I can't.

Soooo, the print symbiont assumes you are printing a plain text file (or
something with embedded HP escape sequences) and inserts a non intrusive HP
escape sequence in front of your file so the printer immediately switches to HP
mode and won't get confused with postscript like text that may appear in your
file.

To print an actual postscript file, you need to specify a parameter on the
print command. This parameter tells the symbiont not to stick in the HP
command in front of your file. At this time, the parameter need only be non
blank (the symbiont doesn't care what the parameter is, only whether it's
there or not). You might want to assign a word for printing regular text
and printing postscript text:

	$ PRLQ :== print/que=lq0
	$ PRPS :== print/que=lq0/param=post_script

The printers each hold about 250 sheets of paper in the "optional tray" which is
underneath the printer. If it runs out of paper, an orange led on the control
panel labeled "paper out" will light. Check to see that the "optional tray" led
is lit (someone may have selected the "standard tray" via a printer command
which, on LQ0, is not normally loaded with paper). To add paper to the optional
tray, open it by pulling the drawer open (and out) to the left. Fill it as you
would a Xerox machine adding paper only to the fill line and reinsert the
drawer. To add paper to the "standard tray", just insert from 1 to about 50
sheets into the upper slot through the paper guides.

	Could you also change the software to use 40 word packets?

	During our Focus Group I noticed that the Compact PCBs and the Stun
PCBs I have do not use the same video resistors.  Do the resistors R97, R108,

	CHECK OUT THE NEW REARVIEW MIRROR!!!!!

	Bugs so far:

	1.  rearview on autocross track has wrong lap car picture

	2. sometimes have problem re-entering a linked game after game finish


	Let us know what you think about the drones?  Are they too hard,
	too easy?

	Has anyone used or purchased one of those electronic personal
event/calendar/diary/phone_dialer/notebook/ items like the BOSS?  If so, are
they worth the +$200 they are asking for such item?

Subj:	LOV on the AMS


The AMS Load Overlay command doesn't seem to be working.  I have ROMs at
80000 to 9ffff on the Multisync board.  If I map 80000 to 9ffff : RO and
then LOV 80000 to 9ffff I should see the ROM image in that overlay area,
right?  I don't.  It has other values.  What's wrong?  Is it (A) I'm doing
something stupid, (B) a defective AMS, (C) LOV doesn't work with Multisync,
or (D) None of the above...

Subj:	LOV in the Afternoon


It should work. I have used LOV zillions of times in loading Self-Test ROMs
on MultiSync Boards.

Perhaps you have run out of Emulator memory. There are some AMSs that report
(and presumably think they have) more memory than they actually do have.

Or maybe you have a naughty AMS.

That's all I know about it.

LOV,

Has anybody out there seen my white Galileo cup with blue Galileo spacecraft
on it? That is the only souvenier I kept since I left JPL. I would really
appreciate the call if you have seen it. Mary Sumner X3722
