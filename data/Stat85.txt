Re: Regulator/Audio III
Dt: 1/16/85

The Problem:

	I have run into a Regulator/Audio III board that behaves strangely
	and I want you to know about it in case there are problems in the
	field.

	The main symptom is noise in the speaker that does not go away when
	the volume is turned all the way down. It may be accompanied by 
	distortion that sounds just like a bad speaker cone (but isn't). The 
	distortion may occur by itself, without the noise.

	In extreme cases the Regulated +5V is affected.

The Fix: 

	Audio:  Clip R16 and R17. In Rev B they will not be loaded.

	Regulated +5V:  Connect a 0.1 uF monolythic capacitor (Atari p/n 
			122002-104) across CR3. This will be added in Rev B.

The Theory:

   1. The +22V powers the +15V Regulator (Q3) and the Audio amplifiers (Q1
      and Q2). 

   2. The regulated +15V powers the +5V Regulator control circuitry (Q6 and 
      Q7). 

   3. The +5V Regulator pass transistors (Q7 and Q8) operate from the +10v.

	I did it this way because the +10 volt output is being operated above
its rated current and at low line would not be enough to power the LM305. 
Therefore I am operating the LM305 from the regulated +15V.

	Because the +10V is already overloaded, I did not want to operate the
audio amplifiers from it, so I connected them to the +22V. This also provides
more audio power.
 
	This makes it possible for an audio problem to affect the Regulated 
+5V. If the amplifiers oscillate, it may get on the +22V. This may cause the
+15V Regulator to oscillate, which will screw up the regulated +5V.

	Removing C16,R17 and C14,R16 from the amplifiers reduces the chance
of the amplifiers oscillating, and adding the 0.1 uF capacitor across CR3
makes the +15V Regulator more stable.

One More Thing:

	If there is no +10V (for example, if the fuse blows) but there is
+15V, the LM305 and the TIP32 will attempt to deliver the current by itself
through R20, which will burn up.

	We have had cases where the fuse looked good (visually) but was
revealed by an ohmmeter to be open.

Re: Game Manuals
Dt: 1/18/85

Before Atari crashed and burned I was on a list somewhere so that
I got a copy of each manual as it came out.

I haven't gotten any in a long time and nobody knows anything about it.

I talked to Cody Lawrence in Publications and she is useless. I asked
why I hadn't received a review copy of the manual (since it contained
a brand new power supply) and she took it as a personal insult. Pete 
Takaichi happened to wander in and HE took the question as a personal 
insult, too. They are both useless.

I talked to Melanie Martin and she is willing to send me a manual if
she has some extras.

Her opinion was that the way to get manuals was to MTO them as they
become available. Of course, if I don't have a manual I won't have
the part number I need to MTO the manual.

I think it is a real waste that I will have to spend all this time
getting a game manual. Why don't you use your influence to have a
a system set up to take care of this?

Item 2: I have sent a Deviation to production to do the above mods.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 3: Regulator/Audio III Rev B is in progress and should be ready to send
	out for Film and Fab by Tuesday.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 4:
	I am continuing to make progress on TomCat. I expect to have 
schematics ready by early February for the first wirewrap. It will consist of 
a 68010 connected to a Vector Generator and will allow me to program the 
TomCat algorithms to get an idea for future direction. (Will it be fast enough
the way it is? Should I increase the processor clock speed? Add a TMS-320? 
Things like that.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 6:

	According to Publications (Cody Lawrence and Pete Takaichi), only 
Project Leaders receive review copies of game manuals. Since I am not a 
project leader I did not receive a review copy of the System i manual even 
though it used my power supply (and was the first project to use it.)  

	I have always been willing to review and check everything concerning 
a project that I do, and I usually give same-day turnaround. I get really 
unhappy when I see errors in manuals; errors that I would have been able
to correct.

	They pulled the exact same crap on Star Wars.

1. Regulator/Audio III:

   	Regulator/Audio III Rev B has been released.

   	I have given PCB the inputs to create Regulator/Audio III-02,
   	which is intended for use in games that have an Operator Panel.
   	This version uses the same PC board as -01 but is loaded differently.
   	PCB will do it when they have time.

2. TomCat: 

	My hardware (version 4) is in the Assembly queue for wirewrapping.

	I have started writing the program.
	
	I would like shelves on the work benches in the TomCat lab.

3. The outside door on our side of the building is very difficult to open.

4. I would like to be able to call the elevators from the ground floor.

5. I would like there to be Cocoa at the coffee stations.

Re: Namco Power Supply
Dt: 5/1/85


To put things into perspective I have converted the costs into dollars.
I have used the conversion that 12,740 Y = $51.00 .

				1K			5K
		          -------------   	-----------------
Switch Bracket		  120 Y  $ 0.48		  120 Y    $ 0.48

Transformer		3,000 Y  $12.00		2,800 Y	   $11.20

Switcher		5,250 Y	 $21.00		5,280 Y    $21.00

Filter			  540 Y  $ 2.16		  470 Y	   $ 1.88

Audio PCB		3,210 Y  $12.84		3,100 Y	   $12.40

Metal Base		  620 Y  $ 2.48		  620 Y	   $ 2.48
			-------  ------ 	-------    -------
		       12,740 Y	 $50.96	       12,360 Y	   $49.44	


I do not believe there is any way we can match these prices with
a unit that we design, purchase the parts for, and build.

I must raise the following questions about the Namco supply:
	
	1. Will the switching power supply operate over a range of
	102-135 VAC or must it be redesigned?

	2. Will the switching power supply operate at an installation
	ambient of 55 degrees Celsius without derating? 

	3. Both the switching power supply and the audio amplifier
	board are single-sided. In the past we have avoided the use
	of single-sided boards because the the parts have a tendency 
	to fall off due to vibration during shipping. Would that be a
	problem with this supply?

	4. Normally the remote voltage sense lines are connected at the 
	game board. Here they are jumpered together at the supply. 	
	Was this done on purpose or is this an error?

	5. System I and System II were designed to use +15 VDC and -15 VDC
	for the audio. This supply contains a 7812 and a 7912 which 
	normally produce +12 VDC and -12 VDC. Are they used in a circuit
	that raises their outputs to +15 VDC and -15 VDC or do they actually
	produce +12 VDC and -12 VDC? (System I can probably use +12VDC and
	-12VDC but Doug does not think it would be satisfactory for 
	System II.)

	6. Is the heat sink containing the audio amplifiers and the regulators
	large enough to operate satisfactorily at an installation ambient
	of 55 degrees Celsius?

	7. Does the transformer have an acceptable temperature rise? Ours
	are Class 105 transformers with a maximum heat rise of 55 degrees 
	Celsius. This allows them to operate at a game installation 
	temperature of 38 degrees with a 12 degree rise to the inside of
	the cabinet. 

	8. How much will it cost to change the transformer to operate at
	120 VAC?

	9. In order to operate at 220 VAC and 240 VAC, either the power
	supply must be redesigned or we will have to use an auto-transformer
	which I believe would cost $14. 

	9. How much would the Namco supply REALLY cost if we were to use it?
	

Now about our supply (Power Base and Regulator/Audio III):

	1. $80 sounds a little high. My guess is that it would cost $70 if
	we bought the parts intelligently instead of scrapping the parts
	and then buying them back at a premium. Or paying a premium because
	of inadequate lead time.

	2. If the Regulator/Audio III could use two cheap trimpots for $0.20
	each instead of the Dual Audio taper pot that we pay $2.00 for, we
	could save $1.60 . (The pot wasn't supposed to cost that much; somehow
	Purchasing has managed to do it.)  

	3. If I could produce a supply that operated at only 120 VAC I could 
	reduce the transformer cost by $4.00 and the harness cost by $2.00 .


Caveat:

	At Atari there is no way to find out how much things will REALLY cost
	ahead of time. There is not even a way to find out how much things 
	have REALLY cost in the past.

	I think you should buy the power supplies from Namco and be done 
	with it.

New Product		Jed Margolin 5/28/85


      This is a box with a microphone connected to it. You can plug headphones
into it or you can hook it up to your stereo.

    Mode 1: You hum into the microphone (or play a kazoo), the box determines
    	    the pitch and uses it to control a Yamaha chip set. The play has
	    a wide choice of instrument voices.

    Mode 2: As in Mode 1, however, it is "recorded". The player can then play 
    	    it back while recording additional tracks. The tracks can be 
	    different instruments.

     If it is cheap enough it can be marketed for kids as a toy. It can also 
be marketed for people who play single note instruments (such as clarinet, 
flute, saxophone) who have not be able to use synthesizer technology if they 
did not also play a keyboard.

Hardware:

     1. It will be powered by a transformer lump (To make it easier to do UL)

     2. The electronics will be:	
		6502
		RAM	(Perhaps Non-volatile)
		ROM
		Yamaha chip set
		Membrane switch pad, with illumiunated switch positions
		Cheap Pitch Extraction Circuitry (This is the key element)
					
     3. It should come with a cheap microphone and a kazoo so people can start
     using it right out of the box.

TomCat Status		6-27-85		Jed Margolin

1). I have completed a set of schematics for a two board implementation of 
    TomCat. After showing Art Jackson the chip count we have decided to try to
    put it all on one multilayer board.

    I am working on a redesign to take advantage of the one-board 
    configuration. It will take about a week.

    Art doesn't know when Joe will be able to get to it because TomCat has
    zero priority.

    If Joe is ever able to work on it I expect to work with him on the 
    schematic entry and on the board layout.

2). Karen is wire-wrapping the TMS-320 math processor for me. It is not very
    much work but it has already been bumped once because it has zero 
    priority.

    It will take about two months to program it so I can measure its 
    performance against the naked 68010.

3). I expect to be able to give a show-and-tell after I have integrated the
    TMS-320 into the program. This will be in two to six months depending
    on whether I can get the TMS-320 system wire-wrapped, whether I will be 
    spending time with Joe (laying out the board), and how much time is
    wasted because the project has zero priority.

4). My productivity is reduced considerably by the poor ventilation system.

Re: Revised Vaction Policy
Dt: 7/12/85


	Since the new vacation policy takes effect March 31, 1986 I assume 

that the "old" vacation policy will be in effect until then. Is this correct?

	Since I currently have almost 5 weeks of vacation accrued and my 

anniversary date is January 15 your memo indicates that if I don't take most 

of it (all but two weeks) before January 15, I will lose it. Is this correct?

	Now, about the "old" policy. The last memo that I have on vacation 

policy is dated 3/12/84 and was issued by Richard Stearns who was at that time

the Human non-Resources Director. According to this memo, employees could not 

carry over more than two weeks of vacation time each CALENDER year, starting 

January 1, 1986. This is the first time I have heard about the anniversary 

date method. When was it changed to the employee's anniversary date?

Re: Specification Review Sheet; Transformer, Power, Domestic, p/n 142041 
Dt: 7/24/85

Section 3.5 Thermal Protection:  	

	Is it necessary to have a thermal cut-out? 

	Wouldn't the fuse in the primary circuit be sufficient?

Section 4.2 Leads:  4.2.1 Size; 4.2.6 Connectors

	If you are going to specify the part number of the Faston

	you should also specify which wire sizes are acceptable, not just

	a minimum size.

Section 5.0 Environmental Requirements:  5.3 Temperature Rise
	
	Why are you using 55 degrees for the delta R method and 50 degrees
	
	for the thermocouple probe? 

	Also: 		 105 degrees C maximum transformer temperature 
			- 55 degree C rise in transformer
			- 38 degree C maximum game installation temperature 
		       ------	
			  12 degree C maximum temperature rise from outside

	the game cabinet to the inside, where the transformer will be mounted.

	In the past, Upright cabinets would have about a 4 degree C 
	temperature rise. The 12 degrees originally was needed because of 
	cocktail cabinets.

	Are the new cabinets actually this bad? 

Cover Sheet: You have Earl on it twice.

   Re: Ants
   Dt: 8/12/85


   There are ants in my lab. In fact, there are ants all over the building,
   and have been for several weeks.

   What is your plan for dealing with this problem?

_____________________________________________________________________________

In looking at the specification for the new transformer (142042) I
noticed that in Section 3.1 and in Figure 1 the 220/240 version
is a 142041-101 while in Section 10 it is a 142041-002.

Also, I think you need to specify that the Faraday shield is to
be grounded to the core.

Re: Marketing of non-game Products
Dt: 3/21/86

From OnSat magazine (a satellite TV program guide) Mar 23 - Mar 29:
==============================================================================
	* Nation's First Commercial Satellite Network 
	     Takes Computer Message to Marketplace *

	The nation's first commercial satellite distribution network for 
computer users has been established by Computer Distribution Network (CDN), 
and can be seen on Galaxy 2, transponder 5, Monday-Friday at 2:45 pm (ET). 
The CDN signal is not scrambled.

	The new network carries mainline advertising messages from 
manufacturers and distributors of computers and computer related products. 
CDN's programming also includes special programs, such as training in the use 
of computers, computer products and software, panel discussions, seminars, 
videoconferences, demonstrations of computers, and other programming developed
exclusively for the business computer user.

	CDN currently airs six hours of weekly programming, but plans 
expanding to a schedule of 24 hours of program availability seven days a week.

	For additional information contact CDN, 1 Woodfield Lake, Suite 117,
Schaumburg, IL 60195.
==============================================================================

	Although it is aimed at commercial and industrial users consider also
that there are about 2 million home satellite dishes in North America. Some
are owned by people who have no other way to get any TV but some are owned
by people who like to buy Expensive Toys. If we had a non-game product to
sell this could be a really good way of reaching a target market.

	A small ad in one of the satellite TV guides could let people know
that Atari was demonstrating something interesting on CDN. 

	Just about anyone with a dish can receive this service.	I have taped 
45 minutes from one of the shows if you want to look at it.
