Driver Sound Board Rev 1
------------------------
I have been working on test routines.


Driver Main Board Rev 1
-----------------------
Stephanie needs to fix her RAM Test so it correctly reports which VRAMs
are bad.


Gate Array
----------
Don, Max, and I have agreed on the major features for the security circuit.


Driver Main Board Rev 2
-----------------------
Joe is working on the PC Board.


Driver RAM Board

This means that if everything goes ok, production cannot be sooner
than May-June.

20 prototypes do not sound like they will go very far.


Driver Main Board Rev 2
-----------------------
Joe is almost done.


Driver Main Board Rev 3 (Gate Array)
------------------------------------
I have given Joe:

	a. Gate Array pinouts.
	b. A drawing of how I want the Gate Array symbol drawn.
	c. Circuit changes to convert Rev 2 to Rev 3.


Driver RAM Board
----------------
Gary has delivered a legible schematic to me, but
nothing else that is usable for anything.


New Prices
----------
	Thomson Mostek (Now SGS Thomson), Rep is THE Bill Woods. 
	   48T02-15, 2K x 8, TimeKeeper   $12.60  (5K) was $14.60 last year
	   48Z02-15, 2K x 8, ZeroPower    $ 6.30  (5K) was $ 7.30 last year


Hardware Status, 22 January 1988					-2-
	


TRW Parts
---------

I have received information from TRW on their TMC2301 Image Resampling 
Sequencer.

The part is used to rotate, translate, scale, and warp 2D images.

It appears to be aimed at applications where cost is no object:

	1. It does one pixel at a time at 18 MHz maximum. At this rate
	a 512 x 512 image can be transformed in 15 ms. This would require
	55 ns memory for both buffers. A display buffer 512 x 512 x 8
	would require 128  4K x 4 SRAMs at a cost of $256. A source and
	destination buffer, double buffered, would require 512 parts costing
	$1024. (For comparison, four buffers in VRAM require 32 parts and cost
	about $192.)

	2.  Slowing it down to VRAM speed (150 ns) would negate its main 
	advantage: speed. Besides, the system does not accommodate dynamic 
	memory.

	3. A system requires two TMC2301s ($69 ea.), a Multiplier/
	Accumulator ($20), and the memory previous mentioned. 


It does do something that is interesting. When a picture is rotated the new
target pixels will probably not overlap the source image pixels. The TRW 
system interpolates the pixels.

Hardware Status, 22 January 1988					-3-

Parts
-----
We are on the hook for two custom parts:

	R2R Networks:	8-18 weeks
	Gate Array:	8-12 weeks


There are several sole sourced parts:

	Texas Instruments:	TMS34010-40, -50

	Analog Devices:		ADSP2100
				AD7582 (12 Bit A/D)

	SGS Thomson (Mostek):	48Z02	ZeroPower RAM	
				48T02	Timekeeper

There are several parts that have several sources but since they
are under different part numbers they must be treated as having
limited or sole sources because PC will not put alternate part 
numbers on Parts Lists.

There are several other parts that Atari has not used before:

	64K x 4 Video RAMs

	TMS32010

	ALS, AS, and F parts

Program ROM on the Main Board needs to be 200 ns, which Atari does
not stock.
 
Unless someone is given the responsibility (and authority) to buy these 
parts in a timely manner we will not be able to produce the game without 
costly delays.

That is for production.


For game development, field test, and show games:

We should immediately order parts for twenty Driver ADSP Boards.

When the parts list for Driver Main Rev 3 (Gate Array) becomes available we 
should order parts for ten boards.

When the parts list for MultiSync Turbo becomes available we should order 
parts for ten boards.

This will allow us to do the Driving Game and also support at least one other
project.

Re: Microphones for recording sound effects
Dt: 3 February 1988


I called the following places and asked what microphone they recommended
for recording sound effects:


Century Stereo - San Jose      -  Bob
-------------------------------------
   Condensor Mics:

	AKG and Sennheiser (Studio quality) for about $1500.
	Shure makes one (SM91) for about $250.

   For recording sound effects he recommended using a dynamic mic because he
   felt it would handle high sound pressures better than a condensor mic.

	Shure RE20 for $550
	Electro-Voice ND-408 for $190.

   Both are cardioid pattern mics.


K&K Music - San Jose
--------------------
   The gentleman I spoke with recommended dynamic mics because they are more
rugged than condensor mics and are less likely to rust out if exposed to
moisture. They also have a selection of Electro-Voice mics.


Delta Services - S.F.	(formerly Sound Genesis)	
---------------------
   I spoke to Don Cruise who said he had installed our Sound Room and 
   knew Brad Fuller.

   He definitely recommended using a condensor mic in order to handle high
   sound levels.

   He liked the Sony C500 which unfortunately is no longer made but which 
   might be available used.

   He suggested a Crown PZM mic for about $300. This is a surface mount mic
   which he thought would be effective mounted on a large swaure of plexiglas.

   He also thought a Beyer M501 Ribbon mic might be good. I didn't know anyone
   still made ribbon mics.


Recommendations
---------------
  I think that before we buy anything we ought to borrow back the dynamic 
  cardioid (EV RE11, I think) that I bought for the PASS Speech Development 
  system and which has apparently become the property of the Sound Group.

  If it works well enough for our application we won't need to buy anything.

Driver Main Board Rev 1
-----------------------
I have added rotors to the HIND helicopter.

I have also added routines to draw a wireframe object from either a
polygon table or a connection list. This is so I can look at the
objects originally designed as wireframe objects in order to do the
polygon tables. I am currently working on converting the T62 Tank to
polygons.

ASSAULT
-------
I have looked at Namco's new ASSAULT game in the harness area. It has a game
feature new to raster video games, which is the ability to rotate the
playfield.

Because it does not have a frame buffer and because the memory is 150ns I 
expect they use the following technique:

To mathematically rotate a point:

	X' = X*COS(A) - Y*SIN(A)
	Y' = X*SIN(A) + Y*COS(A)

where	A is the angle of rotation
	X is the horizontal scan position (assume 0 to 319)
	Y is the vertical line number (Assume 0 to 239)

	X' is the playfield memory horizontal address
	Y' is the playfield memory vertical address

Each position on the screen is scanned, representing an X,Y address.
This X,Y address is converted to an X',Y' Playfield memory address, 
according to angle A.

In order to avoid the use of expensive multipliers:

     1.	SIN(A) and COS(A) are constant for each	angle and come from a table. 
 	
	As Y (vertical line) goes from 0 to 239 one adder is used to accumulate
	Y*SIN(A) and another one is used to accumulate Y*COS(A).  
 
     2.	SIN(A) and COS(A) are constant for each	angle and come from a table. 
 	
	As X (horizontal position) goes from 0 to 319 one adder is used to 
	accumulate X*SIN(A) and another one is used to accumulate X*COS(A).  
 
	A subtractor is used to produce: 

		X' = X*COS(A) - Y*SIN(A)

	A adder is used to produce:

		Y' = X*SIN(A) + Y*COS(A)

	Translations are accomplished using an addition pair of adders (or
	subtractors) to give:

		X' = (X-XT)*COS(A) - (Y-YT)*SIN(A)

		Y' = (X-XT)*SIN(A) + (Y-YT)*COS(A)

I developed this technique about four years ago, but no one was interested.

and am still reviewing it.


Parts List
----------
We have given Jim Wallin parts lists for the Driver Main Board Rev 3 and for 
the Driver ADSP Board Rev 1 so he can start getting firm prices for parts.

I used Jeff's AVL program to create a list containing the AVL entries
for each part on the Main and ADSP parts list.

I have completed a DCL program that extracts part numbers from a SciCards
Parts list and generates a program that (with a little hand editing) calls
MANMAN and creates a list of MANMAN entries.

I have given Mary Burnias the parts list for the Driver Sound Board.
She now has parts lists for Driver Main, Driver ADSP, and Driver Sound.
We still owe her the parts lists for the Motor Amp and the Shifter Amp.

I have written DCL programs to do the following:

   1. Converts SCI-Cards Parts List Files to files that can be used with EDT.

   2. Extracts the Part Numbers and creates a file that, when run, looks up
      stock status in MANMAN.

   3. Extracts the Part Numbers and creates a file that, when run, looks up
      cost in MANMAN.

   4. Extracts the Part Numbers and creates a file that, when run, looks up
      AVL status in DataTrieve.


Driver ADSP Board
-----------------
Timing For Driver ADSP Board ADSP-2100 10 MHz and 12 MHz
Using Preliminary Data Sheet for Fast ADSP-2100, February 1988


Summary:

				8 MHz	10 MHz	12 MHz
				-----	------	------

Clock Oscillator		32 MHz	40 MHz	48 MHz

Instruction Cycle		125 ns	100 ns	83.3 ns

Program RAM speed		45 ns	35 ns	25 ns

Data RAM Speed			45 ns	35 ns	25 ns

Sequential Input Memory Speed	250 ns	250 ns	250 ns
NOPs between SIMBUF Reads	  2	  3*	  3

Sequential Output Memory 
    8Kx8 SRAMs speed		150 ns	150 ns	120 ns	


Sequential Input Memory		

	Reading SIM is ok at both 10 MHz and 12 MHz

	Writing to the SIM Counter is marginal at 10 MHz and not acceptable 
	at 12 MHz.

	This can be fixed by changing the circuit.
 

Sequential Output Memory

	The current circuit is not acceptable at either 10 MHz or 12 MHz.

	This can be fixed by replacing the LS373s with ALS374s and
	changing a trace. 



	Jed



* Can use 2 NOPs if Sequential Input memory is 200 ns.

{ Date Unknown }

Marty asked me to give you my input on his proposed mini-emulator, probably
because at one time I was considering doing something similar.

If there is only going to be one built it is not a cost-effective use of
Marty's time.

Buying a cheap emulator would undoubtedly require an enormous amount of time
to debug and is, again, not a cost effective use of Marty's time.

If there are to be several made the danger is that various people will not 
be happy unless it duplicates or surpasses the functions of the AMS.
Doing a full scale emulator is not a cost effective use of Marty's time.

Making an emulator whose functions are transparent to the target hardware
is not trivial.

Driver Main Board Rev 3 (Gate Array)
------------------------------------
We received eight boards, had one stuffed, and are making progress on 
bringing it up.

Art reports that the disappearance of the connector outlines was caused by an 
error on the part of the PC Designer.



Driver RAM Board
----------------
Art said he had not received any word from SCI-Cards on the problem with the
first RAM Board but that he believed the problem was caused by an error on the
part of the PC Designer.

I told Art that I wanted the RAM Board done on the real SCI-Cards system and 
not on SCI-Design.

He told me not to tell him how to use his tools, which I understood to
mean he is going to have the board done, once again, with SCI-Design.

Driver Main Board Rev 3 (Gate Array)
------------------------------------
The Gate Array seems to work.

We have discovered that the TI VRAMs do not work as advertised, having
to do with Tri-Stating the Serial Data Outputs after a Memory-to-Shift Register
Load. It isn't supposed to.

I will call them on Monday to find out what the deal is.


Driver APU
----------
Gary has started on it.



MultiSync
---------
PC is scheduled to start it on May 2.

The mods to Driver Main Rev 3 are also required on the MultiSync Board.

We will save time later on if PC makes these mods to Driver Main Rev 3
before turning it into the MultiSync Board.

Driver Main Board Rev 3 (Gate Array)
------------------------------------
The Gate Array seems to work. The board is running the Driver Program.
There are still sparklies while it is painting one of the monitor test screens.
The sparklies are not present while running the Driver program. There are
no sparklies on Rev 1 boards.


We have discovered that the TI VRAMs do not work as advertised, having
to do with Tri-Stating the Serial Data Outputs after a Memory-to-Shift Register
Load. It isn't supposed to.


I talked to Andre Gulillemaud (pronounced Gillmo) Product Engineer for TI VRAMs.

	1. We are right about Serial Data going Tri-State about 1 us after a 
	Memory-To-Shift Register Transfer and staying there until the 
	first Serial Clock. There isn't anything they can do about it 
	without redesigning the part.

	2. We have old Rev C parts in which Shift Register-to-Memory Transfers
	and Write-Mode Enables are the same. This is probably what is  
	causing the problem at the top of the screen.

	3. Rev C parts have been known to drop bits.


He recommended that we return them to John Hendricks for Rev H parts. 
(Rev H 	come immediately after Rev C for some reason that I didn't 
understand.)

Andre has sent me the data sheet addendum for the VRAMs.

Sockets for the VRAMs
---------------------
The Robinson-Nugent socket for the VRAMs is not end-stackable and will not
fit on the board. The VRAMs are currently spaced 0.150 and would have to
be redone at 0.200 to use this socket.

The only other source is SAE in Japan. Erwin is getting some for us, hopefully
320 pieces. He has been told that this socket is not stocked in the U.S. and 
orders should be placed early.

The options, in order of my preference are:

	1. Order the sockets from SAE with the required lead time.
	2. Use strip sockets.
	3. Solder the VRAMs directly (no socket).
	4. Re do the board to increase the VRAM spacing.


Driver RAM Board
----------------
Gary is working on it. Unfortunately, Art has insisted that Gary 
use SCI-Design despite my request that he use Schemactive.

Gary insists that the problems with Doug's Cyberball board were caused by
incorrect schematic entry.

Rob says there is at least one trace on the schematic that is not
on the board.

Doug kind of agrees with Rob but does not appear to be concerned about it.



Driver Main Board Rev 3 (Gate Array)
------------------------------------
Still investigating sparklies that are present while it is painting one of the
monitor test screens but which are not present while running the Driver 
program. 

I have gotten the Test Program to run with Watchdog active, except for
Stephanie's memory test routines. Also, the VRAM Verify Test no longer
runs. These will need to be fixed in order that the Test Program can
be part of the Game Self-Test.

1. The casters on the RoadBlasters cabinet do not work and I hope we do ours
   differently.

2. The game did not sound very loud in the arcade environment.

3. The game locked up several times. Presumably the software was in a loop, 
   waiting for something.

	a. These types of loops should use software timeouts, initially
  	   for development to log errors, but also in the final version 
	   to allow some kind of recovery.

	b. Watchdog is the last resort. 

4. The crowd seemed to enjoy watching other players drive, especially
   the Instant Replays. In the final cabinet, either the monitor should
   be easily seen by the crowd or we should offer an optional extra
   monitor.

5. The players were able to handle starting the car, although many were
   probably helped by the crowd.

6. Players seemed confused by the screen to select the transmission.
   Could some way be found that was more pictorial and did not require
   reading?   

7. One guy had trouble starting the car on the hill. He kept sliding
   backwards and stalling out. I liked it.

According to Leon's schematic you have swapped the functions of
190W and 100K. If this is so, you have placed video circuitry
outside the video section.

What does it mean for a part to be "Inactive"?

Does it mean it will not appear on the AVL in Datatrieve?

Does it mean that Manufacturing will scrap existing stocks of
said "Inactive" parts?

If I want to use an "Inactive" part will I have to fill out a CER?

Some of the parts I am using on Driver and Stun Runner are being reported
as "Inactive" They weren't "Inactive" when they were first put on the parts 
list.

What is the deal?

Steve Suttles has installed a squawk system for the manufacturing people
in the back, right outside our lab. It is very loud, and enormously
distracting. 

On Friday, May 27, I informed Steve of this and he said it is under the 
control of Kurt Waller. Besides, no one else had complained about it. 

A little while later Steve called back to say that he had talked to the
Manufacturing people who expressed the opinion that they were being
blasted out of their minds by the system.

Steve showed them (Kurt?) where the volume control is.

As of Tuesday the system is as loud and annoying as it was on Friday.
I talked to some people who work back there who said, "yes, it was too loud,"
and "no, no one ever showed THEM where the volume control is."

Re: Focus Group 6/8/88, Hard Drivin'
Dt: 6/9/88


The Seat
-------
The three groups uniformly seemed to like the seat.


The Graphics
------------
The first two groups liked the graphics. In the third group someone said the 
graphics reminded him of I ROBOT. I am not sure if he said he didn't like the 
graphics or if Lyle said the guy didn't like it.


The Steering Wheel
------------------
When people were talking about the steering wheel it was not always clear 
whether they were talking about the physical effort to move the steering
wheel or about how the car handled. It was clear that the third group did not
like the way the car handled.

Part of the problem may be the speedometer and dash. People did not seem to
use the speedometer much. Several commented that it was hard to see. I expect
that it is also lost in the clutter of guages that are not used, like fuel
and temperature. You should consider making the Tachometer and Speedometer
twice as large, dumping the unused guages, and making the dashboard background
color darker.


Realistic Simulation
--------------------
All three groups seemed to think that the realistic simulation of a car was a
good idea.


Transmission
------------
The third group seemed to have the most trouble with the transmission, mostly
the automatic transmission. It did not help that first gear was usually "out".

I recommend that with the automatic transmission the shifter not be used.

I personally prefer a semi-automatic transmission, using the shifter to select
the gears, but not using the clutch.


Tracks
------
Most people seemed to think the long track was too boring.

The stunt track was too hard for almost everybody. The stunt track has too 
many stunts. 

There needs to be more tracks, with the number and difficulty of stunts 
properly apportioned.


Traffic Cars
-----------
The third group wanted more interaction with the traffic cars. The first two
groups seemed content with the existing traffic. (They probably had enough
to do just to drive.)


Instant Replay
--------------
A clear winner with all three groups.


Sound Effects
-------------
People generally liked the sound effects but,

	Someone in the third group noted that at 7000 RPM the engine did not
	sound like an engine at 7000 RMS.

	Although they generally appreciated the voice help, they would have
	preferred a different speaker. I think they would have liked an
	appropriate female voice. 

	Several people expressed their desire for music. Several wanted to
	be able to choose from a selection of tunes.


Rear View Mirror
----------------
Several people expressed their interest in having the rear view mirror work,
although one guy in the third group said he didn't need it.

 
Other
----
One gentleman was consistently able to drive over the rainbow, leading to
suggestions that the hardware was at fault.

The brake is too close to the gas, and the clutch is too close to the brake.

We need to decide when we can freeze the hardware and schedule PC work with 
Art.

I need to know if you or Max think there are any problems with the hardware.

If we go ahead and release the hardware on July 18 it will not be possible
to order final prototypes. 

As you know, we have had great difficulty in getting correct PC Boards from
PC. It has gotten to the point where there is no assurance that the Board 
will match the schematic, even if it is done on Schemactive.

The Driver APU board is in special jeopardy because it is analog.

A MultiSync board has been stuffed but remains unmodded. (There are two small

	I asked Don Paauw about putting LETA II in a 20 pin DIP and
received the following reply:


From:	SANDY::PAAUW        22-JUL-1988 12:18
To:	MARGOLIN,PAAUW
Subj:	RE: LETA

    There is an updated copy of the LETA-II spec in the components file or I 
have an extra copy that you may have.

    The LETA-II should fit into a 20 pin DIP but this would reqiuire a new 
test fixture and a new test program for VTI's Sentry test.  This would cost
a few thousand dollars.  The piece price wouldn't change much, if at all,
so it would be hard to justify a new package.

-- Don


	According to the LETA II documentation the Clock and Direction 
quadrature signals are clocked into a state machine. The 720 game used
160 KHz. The LETA II document (which is a marked up and not particularly 
legible copy of the LETA I document) says this clock is 450 KHz. maximum.

	The game gets the count information through a dual port RAM. All of this
is in the Gate Array.

	I asked Don if there was some kind of synchonizer in LETA II to
prevent the count changing while it was being read. He said he didn't
think there was.

	My guess is that reading the count while it was changing would
give the wrong count. If the 68010 runs at 8 MHz and the LETA II Clock
is 8/32 = 250 KHz I would expect a very rough maximum average of 1/32 = 3% of
the counts to be wrong.

Game Idea - BattleZone II
Jed Margolin	8/8/88



Perspective: 	3D with Polygons


Hardware: 	Driver System or MultiSync


Cabinet:	1. Driver Sitdown
		2. Upright


Controls:	Star Wars Control,
		Footpedal for Gas,
		Lever to select Forward or Reverse
		Switch to select Magnification factor,
		Switches to select Weapons.


Screen:		The lower part of the screen has a control panel which 
		contains:

		  	Fuel Guage, 
			Speedometer, 
			Radar Display, 
			Weapons Display,
			Message Screen.


Weapons:	25mm machine gun (coaxial with the main gun)
		Armour piercing shells
		High Energy Shells
		TOW Missiles


Situation:	The player is inside his tank, able to drive it, change
		the angle of the main gun, select weapons, and fire them.


Game Play:	The player drives around and is confronted by other vehicles: 
		American and Russian Tanks, American and Russian Helicopters, 
		and American and Russian Personnel Carriers.

		The player must identify the targets. Destroying an American 
		vehicle loses a player's life, but a Russian vehicle that is
		not destroyed in time will fire on the player.

		Destroying a Russian vehicle earns the player big points.
		
		The player starts with appropriate supplies of fuel and
		ammunition.

		Machine gun and main gun rounds follow ballistic trajectories.
		TOW Misiles are guided by the player to the target.
	
		Some targets can be destroyed with machine gun fire (There is
		a lot of 25mm ammo.) Some require High Energy or Armour 
		Piercing. (There are fewer rounds of this ammo). Some targets 
		can only be destroyed with TOW Missiles. (There are not many
		TOW Missiles.)

 		If the player reaches a resupply depot he can replenish his
		supplies. However, resupply depots are considered prime
		targets by the enemy.


Game Link:	Up to six of these units can be linked together in the
		Atari Battle Network, accommodating BattleZone II (Tank),
		the Helicopter Game, and the Jet Aircraft Game.


Game Over:	The game ends when the player loses the requisite number
		of lives. A player who runs out fuel and ammunition will
		not long survive.

		Helicopters, and American and Russian Personnel Carriers.

		The player must identify the targets. Destroying an American 
		vehicle loses a player's life, but a Russian vehicle that is
		not destroyed in time will fire on the player.

		Destroying a Russian vehicle earns the player big points.
		
		The player starts with appropriate supplies of fuel and
		ammunition.

		Machine gun rounds follow ballistic trajectories.
		Heat Seeking Missiles will seek heat sources; if fired at an
		appropriate target at an appropriate range it will hit the 
		target. TOW Misiles are guided by the player to the target.
	
		Some targets can be destroyed with machine gun fire (There is
		a lot of 25mm ammo.) Some are best handled with Heat Seeking
		Missiles; others with TOW Missiles. (If the target is in front
		of the sun, do not use a Heat Seeking Missile.)

 		If the player reaches a resupply depot he can replenish his
		supplies. However, resupply depots are considered prime
		targets by the enemy.


Game Link:	Up to six of these units can be linked together in the
		Atari Battle Network, accommodating BattleZone II (Tank),
		the Helicopter Game, and the Jet Aircraft Game.


Game Over:	The game ends when the player loses the requisite number
		of lives. A player who runs out fuel and ammunition will
		not long survive.

  1. According to Erwin, JAE #DICF-24C without the E2 suffix is 0.6" 
     wide instead of 0.4" wide. There are therefore not useable.

  2. Rick and I have decided that we will build the first 100 games with 
     sockets for the VRAMs (32 per) and solder the parts in thereafter 
     (unless there are problems with the VRAMs or if manufacturing objects).

  2. There are other parts with 12 (or more) week lead times. 12 week
     lead times on the sockets would be ok.

  3. JAE has lied about the availability of sockets before. When I needed
     320 for prototypes in May they promised two week delivery. I actually
     received them last week. I would just as soon not buy anything from them.

  4. Erwin says he gave you information on sockets with machine tooled pins.
     Please look for it and find out cost and delivery for 3200 pieces.

  5. While I am generally not available in the morning, I am here every 
     afternoon and most evenings. I read my VAX mail every day and I always 
     respond to messages sent to my attention.

  6. The following is the AVL entry for the VRAM socket, 179258-014:

We are waiting to do the Driver ECNs until we have a chance to really
go over the Pre-Prods.

But.

Since we have already decided not to stuff the DUART IC, I want to
make sure you know so you won't order it.

It is on ASSY, Driver MAIN PCB, P/L A044425-21:

Item 9, pn/ 137543-001
_____________________________________________________________________________
{To PCB Department, Date Unknown }

Please make me the following plots for MultiSync Rev 2:

Vellum	1:1	+5
Vellum	1:1	GND
Vellum	1:1	Silkscreen

34020
-----
I have obtained the following information from Jeff Twombly of TI about the 
34020:

   Samples will probably be available in April if the first silicon works.

   Production quantities will probably be available in August/September
   if the first silicon works.

   My prediction is that early '90 is more realistic.

   Jeff's prediction for prices in early '90 is:

	34020	32 MHz	$150-$160
		40 MHz	$210-$225

	1MB VRAM	$30-$45		($66 now)

	1MB DRAM	$15-$18


   The 34020 has a 32 bit external memory bus and would therefore require
   eight VRAMs. Eight 1MB VRAMs would thus be 1M Byte VRAM which is what
   the Driver Turbo has now. 

   The 34020-40 has instruction cycle time of 100 ns verses 160 ns for the 
   34010-50 that we are currently using.

   Taking into account the 32 bit data bus and the ability of 1 MB VRAMs
   to write four pixels at a time, the maximum fill rate of the 34020-40
   would be 80 MegaPixels/sec. The other instructions would execute 66%
   faster than on the 34010-50.

   A 34020-40 and eight 1MB VRAMs would cost $450-$585 in early '90.


   Even if the costs were acceptable it would not be prudent to plan on the
   34020 being available in time for June '89 production of Stun Runner.

PC Boards
---------
Driver APU	We have released Rev A.

All PC Boards have now been released.



VRAM Sockets
------------
I have asked Melanie to get prices for sockets with machine-tooled pins as
an alternative to the JAE sockets which have a long lead time and which
have jumped in price.

I recommend that only the first 100 Main boards be built with VRAM sockets.
Unless there are problems the remainder should be built with the VRAMs
soldered in.

If the VRAM sockets continue to be a problem I would feel comfortable soldering
the VRAMs in on all boards as long as everyone involved knows that TI VRAMs
must be at least Rev H (marked HH) and not Rev C (marked HC).



Self-Test
---------
I am continuing to make progress.



Stun Runner
-----------
They have not set up a development system for the MultiSync board that
I delivered to them two weeks ago.



System 3D GSP
-------------
Marty and I have brought up the board. I still have some Test Program 
conversion to do.


	Jed



Proposed changes to Self-Test			J. Margolin    8/15/88


Once Self-Test has started, pressing the Start Switch will terminate Self-Test
and go immediately to the Menu.

The first Menu will be:

	OPERATOR SCREENS
	MONITOR TEST PATTERNS
	GSP TESTS
	MSP TESTS
	ADSP TEST
	CONTROLS
	CLOCK
	SOUND TESTS


The GSP Test Screen will be:

	EXIT
	VRAM SIMPLE TEST - 30 SECS
	VRAM VERIFY	 - 3 MINUTES
	VRAM COMPLETE    - 22 MINUTES
	TEST VRAM FOR DISPLAY GLITCHES
	COLOR RAM

The MSP Test Screen will be:

	EXIT
	MSP VERIFY   - 90 SECONDS
	MSP COMPLETE - 3 MINUTES


The CONTROLS Test Screen will be:

	8 BIT A/D
	12 BIT A/D
	STEERING WHEEL
	SHIFTER
	  ?	


Stephanie will need to add some code to her part of Self-Test to bail out
of the test and go to the Menu.

She will also need to add the Color RAM Tests.

I suggest she wait until after the game goes out on Field Test.

Stun Runner
-----------
They have not set up a development system for the MultiSync board that
I delivered to them three weeks ago.



System 3D GSP
-------------
The board is working. There is some video noise that I believe is caused by
WW construction.

The 68010 Test Program is working, putting characters and a cursor on the 
screen. Either Jim or Max will have to do the 34010 program but there does not
appear to be a big rush for it.

Marty has ordered a 34010-40 so we can have our 34010-50 back.



	Jed


Driver Self-Test
----------------
Once Self-Test has started, pressing the Start Switch will terminate Self-Test
and go directly to the Menu.

The first Menu will be:

	OPERATOR SCREENS

      I need a flag to indicate if the GSP Verify test has timed out (instead
      of all the VRAMs being bad).

      I need a flag to indicate if the MSP Verify test has timed out (instead

101 PGA Socket (179236-001)
---------------------------
According to Verna, Purchasing is aware of our long leadtime parts and is 
ordering them as required to meet our schedule.

The sockets have a 2 - 4 week leadtime and therefore have not been ordered yet.

100 Position Socket for Plastic Quad Flat Pack (PQFP) ICs 
---------------------------------------------------------
According to Corrinda at AMP they make a Micro-Pitch Socket for Plastic 
Quad Flat Pack (PQFP) ICs. 

It is a two-piece socket with the pieces sold separately.

				 500	1000	5000
				-----	-----	-----

	Housing	821949-4	$8.69	$7.98	$7.80		6-8 weeks 

	Cover	821939-1	$1.12	$1.04	$0.83		6-8 weeks 
				-----	-----	-----
				$9.81	$9.02	$8.63

According to the sell sheet:

	" Providing a rugged, cost effective method of protecting the PQFP 
	  during shipping, the cover contains slots that not only protect and 
	  separate the leads, but also ensure proper lead-to-contact 
	  registration between chip and socket. "

Bob Grant has given me the data sheet and a drawing and two samples of the 132
position socket. (I gave one to Erwin.) Bob will try to get me samples of the 
100 position socket set.

System 3D is using a 128 position PQFP for which no production socket is 
available. Unfortunately, it is not a JEDEC package. The AMP sockets are
for JEDEC standard packages like the ADSP-2100 PQFP.

I showed Morgan the socket and he expressed some interest in it. In the 
process he and I have determined that it might be possible to lay out the PCB 
footprint so that the PQFP can be socketed ot soldered. (PQFP is surface mount.)

Aux GSP For System 3D
---------------------
It is now working, locked to their System Sync. There was a problem due
to the number of pixel clocks in their Horizontal Sync not being
divisible by 4. The way I solved it would probably be worth a Patent 
in most other companies. Details are available upon request.


ROM Release Form
----------------
I have done a sample form for the table of information required to release
ROMs.


Other
-----
Since I do not have an AT Clone and there does not appear to be any prospects
of the company getting me one anytime soon, this request will be absent
in future Status Reports. 

Likewise, the VRAM Shift Register Tests that I had hoped to write with said
AT Clone will be absent from the Hard Drivin' Self-Test.

SYNCHRONIZING THE 34010 TO EXTERNAL SYNC WHEN THE EXTERNAL SYNC IS NOT THE
CORRECT INTEGER DIVISIBLE FACTOR OF VCLK


Jed Margolin		
12/9/88



Because the maximum VCLK frequency is 12.5 MHz, it is derived by dividing
the 25 MHz pixel clock by four, to produce a VCLK of 6.25 MHz.

(On earlier 34010 data sheets the maximum VCLK frequency was 7.5 MHz .)

When used with External Sync, the 34010 samples the External Sync on the
rising edge of VCLK.

When the External Horizontal Sync is not divisible by a factor of four
pixel clocks, the 34010 Sync will be offset by from 0 to 3 pixel clocks on
each line. For example: line n could be offset by 0, line n+1 offset by 1, 
line n+2 off by 2, line n+3 offset by 3.

Because 34010 Blanking is produced from this same signal, it will also be off 
from 1 to 3 pixel clocks on each line. Because the pixel scanner is initiated
from Blanking the horizontal lines will not line up.

Possible solutions are:

	1. Redesign the External Sync so it is divisible by a factor of four
	   Pixel Clocks.

	This may not be feasible because of design time contraints or because
	of the requirements of other hardware using the Sync timing.



	2. Use External Blanking instead of 34010 Blanking to initiate the
	   Pixel Scanner.

	This results in the loss of flexibility of the 34010's ability
	to have Blanking under software control.



	3. Use External Sync to trigger a digital delay whose output
	   will initiate the pixel scanner.

	Because the pixel clock is 25 MHz it requires several ICs to produce 
	the required delay.

	This also results in the loss of flexibility of the 34010's ability
	to have Blanking under software control unless addition ICs are
	used to bring the delay under software control.

SYNCHRONIZING THE 34010 TO EXTERNAL SYNC WHEN THE EXTERNAL SYNC IS NOT THE
CORRECT INTEGER DIVISIBLE FACTOR OF VCLK

	4. When External Sync goes high, use this signal to clock the states
	   of 12.5 MHz and 6.25 MHz (VCLK) into a register. These two states
	   indicate the number of pixels by which the pixel scanner must be 
	   delayed into order to start at the correct position referenced to 
	   External SYNC. This is accomplished by using these two latched 
	   signals as the preset data to the Pixel Scanner. State 1 requires a 
	   delay of 3 pixels, State 2 requires a delay of 2 pixels, State 3 
	   requires a delay of 1 pixel, and State 0 requires no delay.


	This requires only one additional IC and retains the flexibility of 
	having Blanking under software control of the 34010.

34020
-----
At Ed's request I have obtained the following information from Jeff Twombly 
of TI about the 34020:

   Samples will probably be available in April if the first silicon works.

   Production quantities will probably be available in August/September
   if the first silicon works.

   My prediction is that early '90 is more realistic.

   Jeff's prediction for prices in early '90 is:

	34020	32 MHz	$150-$160
		40 MHz	$210-$225

	1MB VRAM	$30-$45		($66 now)

	1MB DRAM	$15-$18


   The 34020 has a 32 bit external memory bus and would therefore require
   eight VRAMs. Eight 1MB VRAMs would thus be 1M Byte VRAM which is what
   the Driver Turbo has now. 

   The 34020-40 has instruction cycle time of 100 ns verses 160 ns for the 
   34010-50 that we are currently using.

   Taking into account the 32 bit data bus and the ability of 1 MB VRAMs
   to write four pixels at a time, the maximum fill rate of the 34020-40
   would be 80 MegaPixels/sec. The other instructions would execute 66%
   faster than on the 34010-50.

   A 34020-40 and eight 1MB VRAMs would cost $450-$585.


   Even if the costs were acceptable it would not be prudent to plan on the
   34020 being available in time for June '89 production of Stun Runner.

Stun Runner Hardware
--------------------
I have talked to John Ray about possibilities for cost reduction of Stun 
Runnerhardware.

  1. Stun Runner does not need:

	MSP
	12 Bit A/D
	Steering Wheel Interface
	Shifter Interface
	Sound Power Connector

     The only remaining need for the +12V and -5V regulators is for the DUART.
     Stun Runner is not planning on linking games or having multiple channels.
     Therefore the only use for the DUART is during development. Perhaps some
     alternative arrangement should be made for that. 

  2. Shrinking the board from 16.05 x 16.0 to 14.0 x 16.0 should save more 
     than would be accounted for by just the reduction in board size. 
     According to Doug's memo of 26 April 1988, 14 x 16 is an optimum size for
     the use of the raw stock. 

  3. John wanted to know if the Main and ADSP boards could be combined. I 
     advised against it because:

     a. The ADSP Board already exists;

     b. The changes I will be making to the Driver ADSP Board will result
	in a board useable by both projects;

     c. A large board is more difficult to mount in a cabinet than two smaller
	boards;

     d. A large board radiates more than two small ones.

  4. The final decision will be made by someone-or-other (or maybe a 
     committee) based on the projected cost savings and Art's schedule, which 
     means that the cost savings will be turn out to be whatever is necessary 
     in order to support the decision which will have already been made.

  5. I asked John what Power Supply system they will be using. He hadn't 
     thought about it. The Sound Board they will be using does not exit yet.
     (Stempler is working on it.)

  6. I advised John Ray that you and Max should be involved with some of these
     hardware decisions and that he should wait until early February to 
     involve you.



The following is the projected schedule for Stun Runner hardware that I gave
to Mike Hally and John Ray.


Schedule for Stun Runner PC Boards		J. Margolin  12/12/88
----------------------------------

Feb 15		Final Inputs for Rev 1 Stun Runner Main and ADSP	

			1.5 weeks	

Feb 27		Send out for Stun Runner Main and ADSP Boards

			4 weeks

March 27	Receive Rev 1 Stun Runner Main and ADSP Boards

			2 weeks

April 10	Final PC inputs for Stun Runner Main and ADSP Boards

			1 week

April 17	Order Production PC Boards for Stun Runner Main and ADSP 
		Boards

			7 weeks

June 5		Production


Notes: 	Some parts (like Video RAMs) may have 12-20 week lead times.

	The current MultiSync Board is about to diverge into Driver MultiSync 
	Rev 2 and Stun Runner Rev 1.

	If Pre-Prods are built they should use Stun Runner Rev 1 Boards 
	which are scheduled to be available April 10. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to Driver MultiSync to create Stun Runner Main:
 
	Remove:		Shifter Interface
			Steering Wheel Interface
			12 Bit A/D
			MSP

	What about:	Slapstik?
			Sound Power Connector?
			DUART?	

Changes to Driver ADSP to create Stun Runner ADSP:

			2100 Quad Flat Pack?
			More Graphics ROM?
