Regulator/Audio III-01  Testing
Jed Margolin  2/22/84


1. Test at high line (132 Vac) fully loaded.

   Measure temperature rise for heatsink, 2N6576, and Regulators.

   (The Regulator/Audio Board should be able to operate in an
    ambient temperature of 55 degrees C.)
	
	a. Will the 2N6576 need an additional heat sink?

	b. Will the 7815 and 7915 need their own heat sink?



2. What happens if there is +10.6 Vdc but no +15 Vdc?
 
   What happens if there is +15 Vdc but no +10.6 Vdc?

   (Do it with the +5 Vdc output both loaded and unloaded. 
    Does the 723 get fried by these conditions?)


3. Measure the current limit at TA= 25 degrees C. and at 55 degrees C.

Re: Mathbox Patent Application
Dt: 2/24/84


1. The only new project that uses the Star Wars mathbox is TOMCAT but I am 
   designing new, faster hardware which will replace the Star Wars mathbox. 

   The LAST STARFIGHTER had considered using the Star Wars mathbox but they 
   are now planning on using the Digital Signal Processor (the TMS320) that
   I will be using in TOMCAT.

2. There are no new products out in the market using the Star Wars mathbox.

3. As far as I know, none of our competitors uses anything similar to the
   Star Wars mathbox.

4. There are no new projects using the original mathbox.

5. If we can get anything from it, a continuation would be worthwhile.

This is to confirm that I am taking compensatory time off, covering
the Star Wars and FireFox projects.

I will be gone from Monday, March 5 through Friday, March 30.
I will return on Monday, April 2.

Re: Conflict of Interest Statement
Dt: 4/3/84



Your definition of Family Group is too broad and the involvement of
my Family Group in these questions is an unwarranted invasion of my privacy.


Although, to my knowledge, I have never had any outside interests which 
constitute a conflict of interest with the business and affairs of Atari,
I doubt if I am aware of all of Atari's Affiliates, Suppliers, Competitors, 
and Customers as defined under "Definitions". 

  
Therefore, please supply me with a list of Atari's Affiliates, Suppliers, 
Competitors, and Customers as defined under "Definitions". 


Also, since your document is written in legalese I will need an attorney
to explain it to me. When I receive her bill who do I send it to for 
reimbursement?

Re: Star Wars Retrofit
Dt: 4/6/84


This is to address your concern that that if the retrofit kits
consist mostly of ROMs, then operators will be able to copy them
themselves instead of buying them from Atari.

You also want to be able to retrofit the games in the field without
having the boards returned for rework.

One option, that Greg expressed an interest in, was to do a new Sound
Board with the Yamaha Sound IC, a 6502, and more ROM. Now that
Manufacturing has been shut down, this will not be possible.
Besides, I don't think it could be done in three months.

As far as creating a small piggyback board to plug into something,
the physical arrangement of the boards precludes plugging a piggyback
board into anything interesting. Besides, we have no one to build the 
boards anymore.

My only idea so far is the following:

	There are lots of EPROM programmers out there to enable operators
	to copy our EPROMs. But how available are the programmers to copy
	the bipolar PROMs used for the Matrix Processor microcode? (These
	are 82S137 PROMs).  If these PROM programmers are not widely
	available we can change (or move around) the microcode so the
	operators will have to get the new PROMs from us. By the way,
	I had these PROMs socketed.

Re: Electronic Speech Systems
Dt: 4/11/84


I called Joe Costello from Electronic Speech Systems (415-490-8642)
and found out the following:

Dr. Mozer of the University of California (who developed the algorithms used
in Digitalker) is a partner in Electronic Speech Systems which claims to
have developed new algorithms to make it possible for an 8 bit processor with 
a DAC to perform as well or better than Digitalker. They have a program
that uses about 50% of a 1 MHz 6502 (estimate provided by Joe Costello).
  
They are interested in having us use their algorithms in return for a
royalty estimated at:   $5.00 	in quanities of 1K
			$2.50	in quanities of 10K	
			$1.50	in quantities of 100K

Currently, they do all the speech analysis. Next year they expect to come
out with a speech analysis that runs on an IBM PC. Possibly, they will
do Beta site testing this summer.

If anyone is interested they should pursue it.

Controller for a DC Motor
-------------------------
	

Jed Margolin   5/1/84
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:

A). There is no target date for project completion; most of the
    people on this project have been layed off.

B). Various implementations of the Powered Moving Seat have been shown
    to outsiders as early as (probably) October 1983. However, although
    the Powered Moving Seat was controlled by the DC Motor Controller
    under discussion, the DC Motor Controller itself has not to my
    knowledge been disclosed to anyone outside the company.

C.  What is Atari's policy on the publication of this kind of information?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROLLER FOR DC MOTOR.
ABSTRACT:

A Triac is connected in series between an AC current source and a DC motor.

A microcomputer program is synchronized to each AC half-cycle and by
triggering the Triac during a selected time during a selected half-cycle,
the speed and direction of the motor are thereby controlled.

In its implementation on a Powered Moving Seat, the microcomputer
also receives inputs from a chair position sensor and from a control 
element (either an analog joystick or a communications link to a game). 
The computer program calculates the difference between where the seat is 
and where it should be, and controls the motors accordingly.

The following features are implemented in software and can therefore be
easily adjusted:

	Control of Chair Position Limits 
	Control of Chair Acceleration 
	Deadzone (to prevent chatter)
	Mediation of Control Inputs (Scaling, Offset, and Rate of Change)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed Description of Invention:


1. The invention provides a simple method of controlling a reversible 
   DC motor.

2. The standard method of controlling a DC motor requires some type
   of bridge configuration (consisting of thyristors or transistors) 
   requiring a complicated trigger or drive circuit.

3. Schematics and a program listing are attached.
   
4. The motor drive electronics is greatly simplified over what has been
   done before, while the software permits easy adjustment of the motor 
   control parameters.

Re: Peter Schmelcher
Dt: 7 May 1984


Peter Schmelcher's "Eye Catcher" sounds very interesting. There are
some basic questions concerning this type of device:

	1. Existing devices of this type use a low power Laser. Assuming
	   that this one does, too, there could be liability problems.
	   People would tend to sue us just knowing that there was a Laser 
	   in the game, pointing at them.

	2. An eye tracker is probably not even the fastest control. Missile 
	   Command would probably be too slow with it. And if you've ever
	   played Whack-A-Mole, you know that if you take the time to look
	   at the Mole, it's too late.

	3. An alternative to the Eye Catcher might be something with Doug's
	   position sensors. Something like a helmut-type arrangement with
	   earphones.

	4. If we were to use it, it would require a "champion"; otherwise
	   it would turn out just like the "Face" camera. 

	5. I wonder how much it costs.


I think a demo would be very interesting.

_____________________________________________________________________________

	My DB16000 Development Board is connected to an ERNIE terminal line
because apparently there are no more KIM lines available.

	My problem is that most of the time I end up getting kicked off
of the DECNET link and can't get back on.

	I would like either: 1) a KIM line

				or

			     2) an ERNIE account

	If you give me an ERNIE account please also create the user

Re: The "New and Improved" Atari Health Care Program
Dt: 6/22/84


	I just got the booklet describing the Highlights of the
new Atari Health Care Program.

	It starts off by saying that "no services have been taken away" 
and then goes on to explain:

	1. There is to be a $150 deductible for each separate hospital 
	   admission.

	2. There is to be a YEARLY $150 deductible before Major Medical
	   benefits are paid (for an individual).

	3. These new medical "services" will only cost us $10 a month.

	4. The new Plan for Basic and Major Dental requires a separate
	   $50 yearly individual deductible.

	5. These new  Basic and Major Dental "services" will cost us $2/month.

	6. It is not clear whether Preventive Dental Services is exempt from
	   the $50 deductible. Also, if an individual has routine preventive 
	   dental treatments and requires, say, a filling, does that come
	   under Preventive Dental Services at 100% or under Basic and Major
	   Dental Services at $50 deductible and 80% ?
 

Perhaps R.B.Zufall and I mean different things by the word "service". The only
"service" that a health plan provides is to pay money. (Actual medical service
is provided by people like Doctors, Nurses, and Dentists.)

This plan is obviously going to pay LESS (plus COST individuals $10/month for 
Medical and $2/month for Dental).

It's bad enough that the Medical and Dental Insurance programs are being cut,
but I think that R.B.Zufall has a lot of damn gall trying to make it sound
like we're getting MORE when we are actually getting LESS. Who does this clown
think he is? George Orwell?

The Questions:

0.	Do you feel strongly either way about keeping the Mentor system?
	Which way and why?

1.	Do you know how to use the Mentor simulator (SIM) ?

2.	"         "                   "   timing verifier (TVER)?

3.	"         "                   "   schematic capture package (NETED)?

4.	Do you want to learn how to use those tools?

5.	Do you currently, personally, perform drafting functions on the Mentor
	System?

6.	Do you currently use the Mentor system for engineering functions?

7.	Do you plan to use the Mentor System for engineering functions?
	If no, why not?	

	If yes, when to you anticipate using it and on what project?
	If yes, what benefit do you expect from it?


The Answers:

0.	Either the Mentor system should have its more egregious defects
	fixed or we should get rid of it. The plots it makes of the
	schematics are too small to be usable. Thus it fails to fulfill
	what I consider one of its primary functions.

1.	No. I just want something that I can do schematics on which will
	plot them out in a usable form.


2. 	No.

3. 	Yes. It is a lot like doing it by hand, only slower.

4. 	I just want something that I can do schematics on which will
   	plot them out in a usable form.
 
5. 	No. The plots it makes of the schematics are too small to be usable.

6. 	No.

7. 	No, it's too much work to figure out how to use it.

	During the last two weeks The VAX response time has been ok, but then
I haven't used it very much during the last two weeks. Several times when I 
have been running EDT it bogged down just like always.

	Previous to the last two weeks, it was maddening, trying to run 16032
programs, or even to just Edit. It was even impossible in the evenings when 
the VAX time was normally more available.

	The 68000 programs (and their development systems) seem to require
an inordinate amount of VAX time. It also doesn't help when a programmer runs 
four RT11 jobs in batch at the same time. It doesn't leave very much for the 
rest of use who need an interactive computer system. 

	Selling off the VAXes because "we don't need them" is a self-
fulfilling prophecy.

To: Users of TI TMS-5220 Speech Synthesizer
Fr: Jed Margolin
Dt: 10/2/84

The TMS-5220 Speech Synthesizer (Atari p/n 137308-001)

has a new and improved version that we should use after

we have used up the 11,000 in inventory. The new version

TMS-5220C (Atari p/n 137308-002) is fully compatible

with circuits and data developed for the old version 

but the reverse is NOT true. A circuit design that takes

advantage of the TMS-5220C's new features will NOT work

with the old TMS-5220. Therefore, until someone decides

otherwise, design for the TMS-5220. (Purchasing should

buy the TMS-5220C from now on.)


TMS-5220C - New Features

1. D7 is now the MSB. This is a name change in TI documentation only.

2. There is a new command to change the frame rate. It comes up from
Reset in a mode that is compatible with PASS data.

3. There is a real hardware reset, accomplished by bringing WS and RS
low together for 1 ms and following it with a Reset command. For
actual timing consult the Data Sheet. This means that the external 
circuit to remove power from the IC is not needed.

4. WS timing is better but for most applications the data input will still 
have to be latched.

5. The oscillator input can be configured to accept a 0-5 V, 320 KHz
clock. Therefore, the level shifting circuit will not be needed.

6. The Data and Control Lines have built-in pull-up resistors.

SYSTEM I Switcher Requirements		Jed Margolin 9/84		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE ISOLATION:

	The unit shall be quoted two ways:

		1. The unit shall contain full line isolation so it may be
	  	operated directly from the mains. The permissible line
		leakage shall be less than 0.1 milliamperes.

		2. The unit shall be connected to a source that is isolated
		from the mains.

INPUT:	90 - 140 VAC, 47 - 63 Hz.

OUTPUTS:  5 Volts DC @ 10 Amps	
	+15 Volts DC @ 2 Amps 
	-15 Volts DC @ 1 Amp

REGULATION: The 5 Volt output shall be regulated to between 4.90 Volts and 
	    5.1 Volts at all Line input voltages and installation 
	    temperatures.

	    The +15 VDC and -15 VDC outputs may be regulated by the control
	    element that regulates the +5 Volt output. The tolerance on the 
	    +15 VDC and -15 VDC outputs is plus or minus 0.1 Volt under the
	    condition that there is no voltage drop in the +5 VDC load 
	    harness.

REMOTE VOLTAGE SENSING:  
	Remote Voltage sensing shall be provided for the +5 VDC output for 
	both the positive line and the return line. The supply shall be able 
	to tolerate a 0.2 Volt drop in each of these lines going to a load.

	The +15 VDC and -15 VDC outputs are allowed to proportionately track 
	the +5 VDC output. For example, with a 0.4 Volt total harness drop in
	the +5 VDC circuit, the +15VDC output is allowed to rise to no more 
	than 16.5 VDC.

	Provision shall be made that an unconnected sense line shall not
	result in an output greater than +5.1 Volts.

OPERATING TEMPERATURE:
	The unit shall operate at full ratings at an installation temperature
	between 0 and 55 degrees Celsius.
	    
UL:	The unit shall meet the applicable UL and CSA safety standards.

FCC:	The unit shall meet the applicable FCC standards with an appropriate
	line filter to be supplied by ATARI GAMES, INC. 

_____________________________________________________________________________

Dan,

	On Wednesday, September 26, I sent a memo to various people
requesting that they complete and return to me by Friday afternoon
a survey of their power supply requirements. (It is reprinted here
as [MEMO77.DOC] ). Pat McCarthy (Road Runner) was the only one to do so.
I received some information from Chris Downend on Monday, but most
of it was bogus. 

	In the meantime, on Friday, September 28, at about 7:00 pm,
Rick wanted a spec for you to take to Japan. I stayed until 8:30 pm,
the result being [MEMO79.DOC]. Remember, the Budget System people
had ignored my request for information (and when I did get it, it was
wrong).

	Therefore, when Rick wanted a spec I took my best shot, and
was actually not too far off. The major 'discrepancy' is that the 
switcher I was asked to specify did not include the audio amplifiers
and would therefore have to power them in addition to the game boards.
I guessed +15 volts @ 1.5 Amp for the audio, allowing +15 VDC @ 0.5 A
and -15 VDC @ 1.0 Amp for the game board.  Later, when I examined the 
possibilities more rigorously, [SPKR.DOC], I calculated that 
+15 VDC @ 1.23 Amps would be sufficient for the audio.
The actual totals would be:

					+15 VDC (Amps)		-15 VDC (Amps)
					---------------		--------------
Not-Budget Only:			  1.33			   0.1

Not-Budget + Road Runner:		  1.63			   0.4

Switcher Spec:				  2.00			   1.0


Therefore, I was off by 23% on +15 VDC and 150% on -15 VDC. Or, if you
like (if it is to be for the Not-Budget System only) I was off by 50% on 
+15 VDC and 1000% on -15 VDC. 

I really hate having been dragged into this power supply crap.

****************************** PRELIMINARY ************************************
SYSTEM I Switcher Requirements		Jed Margolin 9/84		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE ISOLATION:

	The unit shall be quoted two ways:

		1. The unit shall contain full line isolation so it may be
	  	operated directly from the mains. The permissible line
		leakage shall be less than 0.1 milliamperes.

		2. The unit shall be connected to a source that is isolated
		from the mains.

INPUT:	90 - 140 VAC, 47 - 63 Hz.

OUTPUTS:  5 Volts DC @ 10 Amps	
	+15 Volts DC @ 2 Amps 
	-15 Volts DC @ 1 Amp

REGULATION: The 5 Volt output shall be regulated to between 4.90 Volts and 
	    5.1 Volts at all Line input voltages and installation temperatures.

	    The +15 VDC and -15 VDC outputs may be regulated by the control
	    element that regulates the +5 Volt output. The tolerance on the 
	    +15 VDC and -15 VDC outputs is plus or minus 0.1 Volt under the
	    condition that there is no voltage drop in the +5 VDC load harness.

REMOTE VOLTAGE SENSING:  
	Remote Voltage sensing shall be provided for the +5 VDC output for both
	the positive line and the return line. The supply shall be able to
	tolerate a 0.2 Volt drop in each of these lines going to a load.

	The +15 VDC and -15 VDC outputs are allowed to proportionately track 
	the +5 VDC output. For example, with a 0.4 Volt total harness drop in
	the +5 VDC circuit, the +15VDC output is allowed to rise to no more 
	than 16.5 VDC.

	Provision shall be made that an unconnected sense line shall not
	result in an output greater than +5.1 Volts.

OPERATING TEMPERATURE:
	The unit shall operate at full ratings at an installation temperature
	between 0 and 55 degrees Celsius.
	    
UL:	The unit shall meet the applicable UL and CSA safety standards.

FCC:	The unit shall meet the applicable FCC standards with an appropriate
	line filter to be supplied by ATARI GAMES, INC. 



The Proposed Regulator/Audio III		Jed Margolin 10/3/84

The least expensive Audio/Regulator board for the Not-Budget Systemi (only) 
would be:
		+5 VDC @ 10 A
		+12 VDC @ 0.1 A
		-12 VDC @ 0.1 A
	
Two audio channels, nominally 3.7 Watts each, into 4 Ohms, using TDA 2002's 
connected to the +12 VDC output.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Audio/Regulator board that could be used with either the Not-Budget Systemi
or the Road Runner game system would be capable of:
		
		+5 VDC @ 10 A
		+15 VDC @ 0.4 A
		-15 VDC @ 0.4 A

It would have two audio channels, nominally 10 Watts each, into 4 Ohms, using 
TDA 2030's connected to the +22 VDC output.
It would cost about $2.00 more than one for the Not-Budget Systemi only. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This same Audio/Regulator board might be used for the Paper Boy project 
(apparently as part of some kind of backup scheme).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please send your comments to [Margolin].


Amplifier and Speaker Calculations:

For a single ended supply of voltage VS, the peak to peak voltage
will be VS minus some slop in the amplifier. Use 1 volt.
	Vp-p = VS - 1			
Therefore: Vp = (VS-1)/2	   
For Sine Wave Vrms = (VS-1)/2*0.7071

Power = Vrms*Vrms/R
      = ((VS-1)/2*0.7071)**2/R

Since POWER = I*I*R, I = SQRT(P/R)
Because it is single ended the effective current is half,
so for each channel I = SQRT(P/R)/2



	VS			 R(Speaker)	Power		   Current 	      Amplifier Type
	(V)			  (Ohms)     (/Channel)	 	1 CH / 2 CH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	10.3 (unreg)		    4		2.7 W		0.41 A  / 0.82 A	TDA 2002

2.	12 (reg)		    4		3.7 W		0.48 A	/ 0.96 A	TDA 2002

	26 (unreg, high line)	    8		9.7 W		0.55 A	/ 1.10 A 	TDA 2030

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Not-Budget Systemi claims to require +12 VD@ 400 ma + Audio and -12 VDC @ 400 ma + Audio.
This is bogus. The 400 ma was made up. For a TI TMS-5220 + a bunch of LM324 a more realistic figure
is +12 VDC @ 60 ma and -12 VDC @ 95 ma. [The TMS-5220 requires 35 ma from -5 VDC. The +5 VDC comes
from the +5 VDC logic, not the +12 VDC. Allowing 10 ma per LM 324 package * 6 packages = 60 ma. 
That is 24 op-amps which should be sufficient.]

	The Audio they are referring to is the Audio Output Amplifiers that this is to help
select.

	The game board requirements should be satisfied by +12 VDC @ 100 ma and -12 VDC @ 100 ma.

	(They could probably use +12 VDC and -5 VDC or +15 VDC and -15 VDC instead).
	(If they are really using LM324's, they shouldn't. They should use TL084's.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The Road Runner game requires +5 VDC @ 7.5 A, +15 VDC @ 0.4 A, and -15 VDC @ 0.4 A.		
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The audio output amplifiers cannot be powered from the +10.3 VDC because it is already
overloaded by the +5 VDC Regulator.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The 7812 is good for about 1.5 Amps.

	The 7815 is also good for about 1.5 Amps.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The +22 VDC output is rated at 1.5 A and the -22 VDC output is rated at 1 A. Since they come
from the same transformer winding, the current available from +22 is increased as the current drawn
from -22 is decreased.

	+22 VDC actually ranges from +18 at low line to +26 VDC at high line.
	-22 VDC actually ranges from -18 at low line to -26 VDC at high line.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*	The maximumn undistorted output level for the TDA 2030 is 10 Watts for 4 Ohm loads and
about 9 Watts for 8 Ohm loads.

From:	MARGOLIN       15-NOV-1984 15:42  
To:	HOFF
Subj:	System I Audio Level

The audio output level should be increased to 5 Vp-p during normal
game play, and should have a reasonable amount of headroom for peaks.

Background:

1. If you leave the output purposefully low so that the audio does not clip 
under any conditions, then most of the time it will not be as loud as it 
could otherwise be.

2. By having the output high enough to clip with the volume control all the
way up you assure that it can be adjusted for maximum loudness.
Presumably the operators will adjust it short of clipping.

3. In the old days, the volume was controlled via a rheostat at the
amplifier output, so that if the amplifier was clipping it could
not be fixed by turning the volume down. The volume control pots
on Regulator/Audio III are at the amplifier input.

4. The amount of dynamic range available for arcade games is fairly narrow.
Arcades tend to be noisy, which sets the low end. The high end is set by the 
amount of audio power reaching the player's ears and is limited by the 
threshhold of pain. Also, if too many sounds are turned on at the same time,
they will simply become an indistinguishable jumble.  

5. Generally, sounds with very high ratios of peak to average levels (like 
explosions) have been allowed to clip. Otherwise, if the system is adjusted
to handle the peaks, the average volume level is too low.

Re: Status Report
Dt: 12/12/84


1. I have given Art Jackson and Joe Dieu the inputs for Regulator/Audio III
   Rev B and asked them to schedule it for January. I showed the changes to
   Tim Hale; he did not have anything else to add.

   The following are the changes:

Jed Margolin	12/12/84
For Regulator/Audio III Rev B:


1. Move the +SENSE test point away from the -SENSE test point.
   
   Reason: Eliminate the possibility of inserting the test points incorrectly.

2. Move the +10.3V test point farther away from the heat sink.

   Reason: Reduce possibility of a short when the test point is being used.

3. Add alternate stuffing for R2, R6. (See schematic).

   Reason: Allow for future use of the Regulator/Audio III without an
	   on-board volume control.

4. Fill in more ground near the heat sink.

   Reason: more ground.

5. Add pads to allow the use of the Centralab potentiometer (P/N 119012-103).

   Reason: This will give us an alternate source for pots.
   The parts list should indicate that either one is acceptable.	

6. Remove Solder Mask around 2N3055 mounting holes. (As per note on FAB 
   drawing.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. I have gotten the run-around on the Marble Madness audio levels. Morgan
says it's Brad's fault because he is not using all the loudness range.
Brad says that's not true. Morgan wants to fix it by increasing the output
to 15 vp-p. I say that's bullshit.

The following is the memo I sent to Brad and to Morgan:

From:	MARGOLIN       15-NOV-1984 15:42

Re: Regulator/Audio III Costs
Dt: 12/20/84

I just received a copy of Rod Peterson's cost information on the 
Regulator/Audio III.

I used the best information I could get, and it was wrong. I used as many 
parts from inventory as I could and then it turned out these parts had been 
scrapped.

It makes me look bad and I am mad as hell about it.

Regulator/Audio III	Rod Peterson's cost	 =    	$31.95

			My estimate in September =    -	$23.64
							-------
							$8.31

Total Increase:
---------------
			  1.  Inventory Parts		$1.91
			  2.  CTS Pot			 1.01
			  3.  PC Board			 3.75
			  4.  TDA 2030			 1.20
			  5.  Heat Sink			  .49
							------
							$8.36

Item 1
-------
When I did my cost estimate I used the best information I could get, which was
the AMPS system before it was turned off. This was in September.

As an example take 24-250477 (470 uF 25V Electrolytic Capacitor). According
to AMPS we had 71,350 in inventory and paid $0.11 a piece. How could they now
cost $0.477? And why do they cost almost twice as much as a 1000 uF 25V part?

	Was the original AMPS entry incorrect? 

	Did the capacitors somehow increase in cost while they were sitting in
	inventory? 

	Did our inventory go through some kind of time warp?

	Did we store them in a 747 that was kept in the air (with in-flight
	refueling) so as to be immediately available once it was determined
	where the factory was going to be?

	Did we sell them off and buy them back? 

There are 9 items that fall into this category, accounting for an increase
of $1.91 .

Item 2
------
	The CTS volume control pot (119011-103) is listed as $2.028  .
According to the quote I got from CTS, this would correspond to a quantity
of 300 pieces. Are we buying our parts in quantities of 300? 

This accounts for an increase of $1.01 .

Item 3
------
	The PC Board used in the Regulator/Audio II is 91 square inches 
(6.5" x 14") and costs $8.08 . (0.0888/sq in)

	The PC Board for Regulator/Audio III is 119 square inches (8.5" x 14")
and costs $12.25. (0.103/sq in). Why is that?

Item 4
------
	The TDA-2030 used in the switcher was listed as $1.50 each. Why are
they now $2.10 ?

Item 5
------
	The cost of the Heat Sink increased by $.49, presumably by having
three more holes drilled in it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is impossible to get reliable cost information ahead of time. However, 
critical Engineering decisions are often based on price differences of $1.00 
or less. 

It is no longer possible to base a design on the cost effective use of parts 
in inventory, because these parts could be scrapped at any time without 
notice.

Atari's system makes parts cost too much because:

	Atari sells parts from inventory and then buys them back (at an 
	inflated price).

	Parts that require some amount of lead time are purchased at a
	premium because parts are not bought until the game is released
	and games are manufactured as soon as they are released.

	There does not seem to be any way of buying parts in quantities
	beyond what is necessary for the next release of 300 games.

If you want to avoid a price increase on the Transformer Power Base,
Alltronics-Howard is selling them for $10. Ginsu knives are not included.
