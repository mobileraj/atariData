Subj:	New person on board in Publications Dept.


     Effective next Monday, Jan. 11, we have a new person in the Publications
Department.  Rosalind Hutton replaces Pat Cook as a technical writer.

     Rosalind will be responsible for writing the text for all of our techni-
cal publications, and she will also be doing some page layout with one of our
new Macintoshes.

     Rosalind has a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the University
of Arizona.  She came to us from SEI Information Services Co. in San Jose,
where she also was a technical writer.  Before that she worked at Space Age
Publishing in Santa Clara.  She was a mechanical engineer for 3 1/2 years in
Colorado, Oregon, and Arizona.  Among the more interesting things she has done
is teach English at Hunan University in the People's Republic of China.

     Please welcome her and feel free to introduce yourself; her extension is
3719, and her username is [HUTTON].

Subj:	Stress Diet


Having been under a bit of stress lately, I have found that the diet given
below has a remarkable way of dealing with STRESS.

			THE STRESS DIET	
			--- ------ ----

Breakfast
---------
1/2 Grapefruit
1 Slice of whole wheat toast
8 oz. Skim milk

Lunch
-----
4 oz. Lean broiled chicken
1 Cup steamed zuchinni
1 Oreo cookie
Herb tea

Mid-afternoon Snack
------------- -----
Rest of the package of Oreos
1 Quart Rocky Road ice cream
1 Jar hot fudge

Dinner
------
2 Loaves of garlic bread
Large Pepperoni and mushroom pizza
Large pitcher of beer (light!)
Entire frozen cheesecake eaten directly from the freezer

***********************************************************
***********************************************************

DIET TIPS
---- ----
1. If no one sees you it it, then it has no calories.
2. If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, they cancel each other out.
3. When eating with someone else, calories don't count if you both eat
	the same amount.
4. Food used for medicinal purposes NEVER counts against your diet.
	Such as:  Hot chocolate, brandy, toast, and Sara Lee cheese cake.
5. If you fatten up everyone else around you, then you look thinner.
6. Movie related foods don't count against your diet because they are
	simply a part of the entertainment experience and not a part of
	one's personal fuel.  Such as: Milk duds, popcorn with butter,
	junior mints, and red liccorice.
7. Cookie pieces contain NO calories.  The process of breakage causes
	caloric leakage.

Subj:	Yet another Greenhills Bug


	The following Greenhills C bug (version 1.8.0) caused a really obscure
bug in the stats package on XYBots.  I have kluged around it on all the stats
packages I "control", but those of you who are winging it on your own, or just
generally multiplying unsigned shorts occasionally, should watch out!

	The following code fragment:

unsigned int coins,time;
	...
time = (unsigned short)time * 60;

produced the following assembly:

	MOVEQ	#0,D0
	MOVE.W	D3,D0	*fr
	MULS	#60,D0

note that it "knew" that D0 was unsigned, and that the constant 60 (which is
clearly positive) would fit in a short, but it used a MULS.

	Changing the second line to:

time = (unsigned short)time * (unsigned short)60;

fixes the problem (this time).

I usually disdain recommending investment opportunities, however, I think
this gizmo is worth mentioning. First a little background:

As oil is pumped from the ground either on dry land or especially from under the
ocean, water is usually also included in the fluid (sometimes on purpose because
water is injected into the well to help with the oil extraction). The oil/water
sauce is typically run through a simple floatation extractor which removes
some of the free oil by letting it float the surface of a tank then skimming it
off. This method removes none of the dissolved oil (oil molecules bonded to or
trapped between water molecules). This filtered water would then be dumped
overboard in the case of an off-shore well or into some nearby river or lake in
the case of an on-shore well. As you might imagine, the water systems in areas
where there are active oil wells gets pretty contaminated with oil. Fish, birds
and plants die off. The EPA has established some standards for a maximum
oil/water mixture and oil/sand (oily sand is also sucked from off-shore wells)
that can be dumped into the local environment. The standards are set based
upon what the current technology can provide (perhaps also via bribes).

The gizmo:

Glenn Gilley of Gilley and Associates has developed what is known as a Solvent
Extraction Method (SEM) of removing free and dissolved oil from production
water. It looks quite neat in its simplicity; it uses centrifugal force to
remove the free oil, injects a gas (solvent) into the water to attract the
dissolved oil and later extracts the solvent from the cleaned water to be
recycled. It can purify water to far in excess of the current EPA standards
which (I hope) will prompt the EPA to tighten up their standards. The machine
has only 1 moving part (a pump) and takes up roughly 1/10 the space of the
current SEM systems.

Minimum investment is $10,000. I have a prospectus in my office if you care to
look at it. I also have a 10 minute video tape with a demo on it.

And to satisfy the SEC:

	THIS MESSAGE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL OR THE
	SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY THESE OR ANY SECURITIES.

A couple people have asked about a "global search and replace" function.
There wasn't one yesterday, but there is one today. The next time to
login or RESTART, type:

	$ GSR  file

where "file" can be a wildcarded filename or a single file. It will prompt for a
search string (can't be null), whether the search string is a TPU
regular expression (normally No, the default) and whether you want a case
sensitive search (normally No, the default). It will then open each file,
do a global search and replace through the file and write out a new one in
the same directory as the source if there were any changes.

If you currently use or expect to use VPIF, a tool that allows one to 
view picture files on the GPX terminals, then read on.

	This program, running on the GPX's in the LSI CAD lab, 
has a nasty problem.  It takes almost all of the cpu.

	EVEN WHEN THE DISPLAY IS STATIC AND 
	THERE IS NO APPARENT PROCESSING OCCURING.

The batch queues grind to a sub-crawl.  
This stops LSI design unnecessarily.

	So please, if you use VPIF get what you need then log off.

Subj:	Unsolicited Testamonial (Mexican Restaurant divison)


    Let's say, for the sake of argument, that you like Mexican food.  You like
Casa Azteca, but sometimes would like something a little more well...
"Mexican". La Milpa suits your taste, but you would rather not wait 2 hours
for a one hour meal.  Well, have I got a deal for you.  Last Saturday I
was in exactly the situation described above and my wife suggested that we
try out a new little place called "Gardenia", in Abel Plaza.  I am now glad
La Milpa was so crowded.  I will continue to go there sometimes because:
	a) There have Chicken in mole sauce everyday (not just Sunday).
	b) They are closer to my house.
	c) They are a bit dressier (although they aren't the Ritz and
	   Gardenia is not a dive.)
	d) I like the people there.

    But Gardenia is a VERY attractive alternative.  Yes, they have Mexican
hot chocolate (like La Milpa). Yes, they have the tomato/onion/cilantro salsa,
like La Milpa. (Casa Azteca has neither). PLUS, they have Penafiel sodas,
which I remember fondly from my school days and can get at neither of the
others.  I had the Verde, while my wife had an enchilada/chile relleno combo.
Both were excellent. And they have all sorts of neat stuff on the menu which I
intend to try....

    So why am I telling you? After all, I was one of La Milpa's first customers
and now all you riff-raff are lining up and keeping me waiting. Well, we were
only the fourth party on Saturday night, while La Milpa was spilling onto the
sidewalk. I am afraid these folks won't last long enough for me to eat my way
through their menu if they don't get some more business soon. So... cruise over
17 (pardon me, 880) on Calaveras and turn right on Abel, then left into the
parking lot. Gardenia is at the far left of the little shopping center.

			Try it, you'll like it.

			2 page 11 x 17 
			2 page 11 x 17  on demand
			2 page 8 1/2 x 11 (same as above, reduced) on demand

    On demand means that I'll make them for you as you ask for them.
 
    If yours are dated more than a year ago they are hopelessly out of date, 
 there have been a large number of changes since then (If they are undated this
 is still true).

Subj:	Charm


The current Charm is actually one of the new Vaxen. It doesn't have ANY
disks of its own. Instead, it is using GAWD's system disk for system, page
and swap files. CHARM$USERDISK is located on Kim, so Kim does the file
serving for Charm's userdisk. It may crash because DEC says the system
can't be hooked up like this, but I did it anyway. You will know if they
were right.

For some things, you may notice that this system is about 3 times faster
than the old Charm. However, since it does its page and swap access via
Ethernet, it may slow down quite a bit for other things. Also, it won't
run MAC65, the BSO assembler or TECO.

I believe that the 780 Charm's system disk has some kind of problem which
has been the reason for 780's crashes recently. I dual-ported Charm's
disk controller last weekend so that you could get to the userdisk even 
if Charm was down. As it happens, the problem in the system disk seemed
to cause both Kim and Charm to crash, so it has been disconnected.
A 780 won't work without a system disk which is why I tried hooking 
things up this way. Perhaps by tuesday the disk will have been fixed
and I can put things back to normal.

Subj:	GAWD - Gettin' Alot of Work Done...


The new VAXen are hooked up and appear to work. Kim and Charm's SYS$BATCH
default to running on the compute server (GAWD) and we strongly recommend
that you use BATCH for all your compiles, assemblies, links, PPS utilites
and any other compute bound tasks. You'll find that your jobs will complete
in 1/3 to 1/4 the time it would take on an un-busy 780 (there used to be
such a thing as an unbusy 780, but I think such a thing is extinct these days).

I believe it will be faster to batch even "tiny" compiles than to run them
interactively. Besides, you'll automatically get a log of any errors.

There are two commands (.COM files actually) that make it easy to use the
batch stuff: AT and BATCH. Use AT in place of an "@" on a .COM file that
you would normally run interactively to cause that file to be executed in
batch mode. Use BATCH to execute a DCL command in batch mode. For example:

	$ AT A_COM_FILE
	$ BATCH MAKE MY_PROGRAM

MAC65 users are out of luck for a little while yet. MAC65, LINKM, TECO and the
BSO 68000 assembler will only run on a 780. You should switch from using TECO
to TPU; from LINKM to LLF; BSO to Intermetrics. If these system problems
give me a break, a new MAC65 written in C should be useable by April.

DEC will be out this coming thursday to "install" the new VAXen, so I'll have
to take them apart and put them back in the box wednesday night. They should
be back online by noon thursday unles DEC breaks them.

	I have tentatively set up a meeting with the sales rep and a Toshiba
engineer who is a specialist in memory devices (EPROMs, RAMs, mask ROMs, etc).
He should be able to answer any questions regarding the 'address activated
circuit technology' that some had voiced concern about.  Any other memory
topics would also be welcome. 

	May I have a raise of hands of those who would like to attend a

There are a couple of changes which you might want to include in your LOGIN.COM
file to eleminate the recurring problems with cdefs.com moving or becoming
obsolete etc. A CDEFS.COM is permanently located in UTL$COM. This file
references a system logical name IM_TOOLS: which will change with future
releases (if any) of the intermetrics tools so without making any changes in
your procedures, you will always be using the latest release of the tools. 

There are instances where one must keep using an older release of some tools.
In this case, you can assign the logical IM_OLDTOOLS to IM_TOOLS before calling
CDEFS.COM. At this time, there are no old IM_TOOLS so both names point to the
same directory.

	$ assign IM_OLDTOOLS IM_TOOLS 	!if you don't want new versions
					!as they are released.
	$ @utl$com:cdefs	!gets the Intermetrics tools logicals

The GreenHills C compiler is called up via a foreign command. It appears
everyone has a different word for invoking the C compiler so I can't do
a common command file to set it up. There are however, two logical names
to assist in defining your GreenHills C compiler startup:

	GH_EXE and GH_OLDEXE

GH_EXE will always point to the latest release and GH_OLDEXE will point
to the previous release. At this time, GH_EXE and GH_OLDEXE point to the
same directory. Use it thusly:

	$ GCC :== $GH_EXE:CCOM68	!for the current release
	$ GCC :== $GH_OLDEXE:CCOM68	!for the previous release

Subj:	Abject apology, with forelock tugging


	Since I've been raving about how those $%#&* hardware guys
keep screwing up the coin switches, I guess it's my turn to eat crow.
The reported problem with mech-multipliers on Blasteroids is in fact
my fault. Those poor coins went through two processors and at least
4 subroutines before I twisted them at the last possible moment.

	Anyway, all this is really pretty straightforward on the
standalone audio board. The rightmost switch gets hooked to the rightmost
bit (D0). The rest follow in order (up the byte right to left). These
single bits get translated into two-bit (what else, at least in the U.S.)
fields that get sent to the game board, but again, rightmost is rightmost.
Should we bring up 6502 based boards that connect their coins to the MSB's
MSBs of the inputs? In case you wondered, the rightmost switch connects
to D7 (actually the rule is that rightmost goes to the bit that falls out
first when you shift). Anyway, it's supposed to be the 6502 coin routine's
problem to get things straight before sending them on to the game, and
the S.A. board does it right.

	On a separate-mech game (e.g. Xybots), everything stays consistent
again, the rightmost mech is for the rightmost player. But players are
number left to right (0..3), whereas bits are numbered right to left
(fun, huh). This is still not too confusing, until I re-converted the
Gauntlet-style coin routine, as hacked for S.A. Audio, back to System I
style. 

	The software is clearly wrong, and can be fixed in one of two ways.
I can change which mech I consider "right", leaving right the more valuable
mech. Or I can change the wording of the coin options, acknowledging that
the Left mech gets the higher value. I vote for option one, but will listen
other arguments.

	Can get some mercy by pointing out that if I didn't have to
keep changing this stuff I wouldn't keep breaking it?

				Didn't think so!
				Mike

Subj:	DIO model 288


Finally, the DIO model 288 talks to the VAX. This programmer has 8 32 pin
sockets so it can program 1 megabit EPROMS. It has 512k of ram (same as the
IMI). It appears to be somewhat slower than the IMI but it is no doubt
faster than waiting in a line for the IMI. 

Unlike the DIO model 29A, this programmer has an automatic family/pin
code selection mechanism that actually works. There's even a way for the
VAX to find out the real F/P code after it automatically figures one out.
So, it is no longer necessary to specify a DEVICE command to the DIO
procedure if you are programming devices larger than 27128's. The VAX
will force an auto f/p select and report the other manufacturers parts
that may be interchanged with the ones you are programming.

Until I get a switch box built up, you can switch between the 29A and the
288 by unplugging and replugging the RJ11 connector (telephone type) from
the light blue (29A) and dark blue (288) DB25 connectors lying behind the
two units.

If you need to upload a set of EPROMS but want the data to appear in the
uploaded file as though it were 16 or 32 bit words, you can do that with the
/WORD=nn option on the UPLOAD command. I think you will also have to specify
the whole range too. For example, if you want to upload 4 27256's into a
file as 16 bit data:

	DIO> UPLOAD your_file_name 0-1FFFF/WORD=16

Both the 288 and the 29A (with the GANGPAK) will do this.

Subj:	MacPaint to PIF/RAD conversion, and EASY picture digitization


Here are a couple utilities to make life easier for somebody:

1. Convert any MacPaint file to a PIF/RAD file.
   	Read charm$userdisk:[theurer.mac]mp.doc for details.
2. Digitize a picture and get a PIF/RAD file, almost as easily 
   as running the Xerox machine.
	The digitization is done on Mary Sumner's scanner / Mac II system.
	"Publish Pac" program scans your picture and produces a 
	MacPaint file (bi-level or halftone style 1 bit deep).
	(You can specify the size of the resulting picture).
	Then execute the MacPaint to PIF/RAD conversion.
   	This works really well on line drawings.

Coming Real Soon Now:
   Conversion of TIFF files (scanned pictures with 256 grey levels) to RAD.

Subj:	using .COM files with AVL


You cant get there from here...

Because I had to have AVL support ANY terminal types, yet still needed
timeouts, I had to use QIOW's for the inputs.  The QIO's are to the
terminal, and a file isnt a terminal.  I'd have to write the program using
FAB's (file access blocks) and RAB's (record access blocks) which would more
than quadruple the code... at least thats what the systems folks tell me.  I
think I could do it with a call to SMG$READ_COMPOSED_LINE, which allows for
timeouts and doesnt do anything thats terminal specific.  I'll try to get
around to it next week or so.  I tried using a .COM file with another 
program that uses SMG$READ_COMPOSED_LINE and it worked.

I forgot to mention how to enable the DIO 288 for VAX access. The message
COMPUTER CONTROL should appear on the top line of the LCD display. If it
doesn't, then press one of the arrow keys repeatedly until the message
RS232 PORT shows up on the top line of the display. (If pressing the arrow
keys doesn't change the top line of the display, then press any of the
number keys until the 288 beeps, then try again with the arrow keys. I.e.
bang any or all the buttons until the DIO cries for you to stop.)

After you get the RS232 PORT message, press ENTER twice. After the first
ENTER, the message COMPUTER CONTROL will appear in the lower window (if not,
press the arrow keys until it does) and after the second ENTER that message
will replace the RS232 PORT message.

Subj:	ACME TRADE SHOW  


As many of you may be aware, this coming weekend, March 11 through 13,
our industry will be sponsoring its annual ACME Trade Show in Reno,
Nevada at the Bally Grand Hotel and Casino.

This is the first time that this trade show has been held in the western
United States.  Though we have officially limited the number of Atari
employees who will be formally attending the ACME Show on "company
business", I would like to clarify that any and all employees are
welcome to attend this function "on their own time and expense".  It is
unlikely that another major Coin-Op industry trade show will be held
this close to the Bay Area any time in the foreseeable future, and as
such, this is an ideal opportunity for those who have never attended to
do so.

Subj:	Some new stuff


Have you been steamed at MAKE, the quemanager, DIO or IMI lately? Well, I just
added somemore junk that may REALLY make you mad. On the other hand, you might
like it. 

For the IMI and DIO, the system will broadcast a message to all terminals logged
in with a username that matches the top level directory specified in the FILE
command announcing that "your roms are done" when they are done programming,
verifying or uploading or any other stuff that you might do. (I'll try to fix it
to be more discriminating later). It remains to be seen if this is a good
feature or not. I'm sure you'll let me know one way or the other. 

I have found that the message returned at the completion of a batch job leaves a
lot to be desired (i.e. bla_bla completed with status of "%NONAME-E-WHAT,
Undecodable message number %X09898080" or some such nonsense. So, I tried to fix
that. There's a new program to do the announcing and there's some changes to
MAKE.EXE and MAKE.COM. One key point is that the notification of completion of a
job started with a DCL BATCH or AT command is done by an announcing program
rather than the que manager. As a result, your job may not actually be complete
until a couple seconds AFTER you get the message. Sorry, but this appears to be
the only way I can get meaningful messages to your terminal from make. 

If you cause your make procedure to exit with a status code between 0 and 4,
then one of the following messages will be broadcast to your terminal: 

	code 0 = Completed with warning(s)
	code 1 = Normal successful completion
	code 2 = Completed with error(s)
	code 3 = Completed with information message(s)
	code 4 = Completed with fatal error(s)

i.e. $ EXIT 2 would signal completion with errors. Any other codes will be
translated to the VMS message that it may represent and sent to your terminal.
For example, if you trapped the error status from some VMS utility and exited
your procedure with that status, then the appropriate VMS error message would be
broadcast to your terminal. 

In addition to these changes (and partly to better use the messge facility),
I've added three special macro names to MAKE: *, < and >. These names represent
the current root filename (*=whole root; < is name portion only; > is type
portion only). You may use these macro names anywhere in the makefile except in
a dependency list which wouldn't make any sense anyway. The macro is not
expanded until it is used in a method stream. The following example (an excerpt
of MAKE's makefile) uses this feature along with the new announcing program to
blast reports of compile and link errors AS THEY OCCUR during the make. Using
this feature makes the methods for the files quite small (in the case of the .c
files, a single macro call): 

FILES = #H, make.c, macro.c, token.c, parsedir.c, file.c

	Gene Cavanaugh is with a Mississippi consortium called the Institute
for Technological Development.  This is a cooperative effort between the
government, academia, and industry to try to develop a better base for high
tech industry in Mississippi. The entire group has initial funding of $20 meg
and the advanced microelectronics section has the largest share of this.  The
engineering manager for this section is Bill Durham from Texas Instruments.
	The group's plan is to generate local industry by encouraging spin-
offs from projects they initiate.  According to Gene, the group has about
14 engineers and 14 Sun workstations with a very wide variety of software
packages.  They are planning on getting VTI's tools.  The group's recent
work has included megacell development for NCR, Thompson, and others.
	Gene wants to come by with Bill Durham to see if we have any basis
for joint projects.  Some possibilities include them doing designs for us for
little or no NRE in return for manufacturing rights or their licensing some of
our designs to market. (Gene specifically suggested licensing the PIXI or
Calfee's RISC).
	I've tentatively scheduled a meeting with Gene Cavanaugh and Bill
Durham in the executive conference room at 1:30 on Wed. March 16. Please
let me know if there is any interest in this meeting.

Pat, 
	Due to the extreme difficulty in locating these parts, I have advised
purchasing (Mary) to go ahead and order 55ns parts from Motorola (MCM6164C-55)
at high cost to us (over 6 dollars).  Between Mary and myself, we have contacted
over 20 manufacturers or their representatives with the result that there is no
chance to obtain 80 or 85ns parts in time for Vindicator production.  If you 
have any objections to using 55ns parts, please let us know immediately.
	There seems to be three reasons that 80ns is not available:
		1. The manufacturer does not make slower than 55ns,
		2. The manufacturer does not make faster than 100ns,
		3. The manufacturer will not be producing speeds in the
		   70 to 85ns range until many weeks or months from now.

supply channels to support it.  If there aren't enough 512's for us to

are enough 512's then where are they?  Are they hard to get on purpose so
we will respect their value?  This is one game I don't enjoy.  (and it's

first one being for Manufacturing.  It is anticipated that if all goes
according to schedule, Manufacturing would move into the new facility by
March 31, 1989.  Thereafter, a second building will be started with the
expectation that company personnel in building 675 would move into that
building during the first half of 1990.

We will keep you advised on the status of the company's plans as they
develop.

Subj:	ex


	It has come to my attention that a variety of dangerous and
addictive mind-altering drugs are being used and/or distributed here at
work by Atari Games employees.  In fact, some of these substances have
reportedly been supplied, free of charge, by the company itself.  This
is intolerable and must stop immediately.

	First of all, a large number of workers are apparently addicted
to the powerful stimulant caffeine.  These so-called "caf-fiends" will go
to any lengths to get their morning fix, even if it involves taking the last
available dose and leaving a quarter cup of coffee in the pot for the next
poor addict.  Others abuse the substance known as "Jolt", apparently because
they feel its well-known eye-bulging effects make them more physically
attractive.  Coca-Cola may have removed the coca from the formula, but it
still has the cola - a caffeine-rich nut which leaves its victims feeling
"wired" and "awake".  Chocolate also contains caffeine, and users will
obtain their "bars" any way they can, even procuring them from innocent
young girls.  Caffeine has been shown to cause insomnia, heart arrhythmias,
mild delirium, and broken chromosomes, and is regarded as possibly
hazardous to the fetus during the first three months of pregnancy.
	
	Ethyl alcohol is another psychoactive drug used by certain employees.
This substance has been distributed at various Atari Games functions,
("brainstorms" and "parties"), despite the fact that it is highly addictive
and extremely toxic.  Its use may result in disorientation, impaired
insight and judgement, diminished intellectual capability, and throwing up
on your shoe.  (Prizes have even been awarded to encourage the latter.)
Many of our employees display the tell-tale bloated look, flabby muscles,
and chronic degeneration of the typical alcohol abuser.  Some days you can
hardly walk down the halls without seeing someone who is apparently in the
midst of an acute delirium tremens episode.

	Finally, certain employees have been observed toking on nicotine
cigarettes while at the workplace.  With no regard for the health threats
posed to themselves or others, these "ash-holes" suck one "butt" after
another to get their foul chemical gratification.  As with all stimulant
drugs, the stimulation of the brain is followed by a period of depression,
which reinforces the user's dependence.  The user may require larger and
larger doses to achieve the same level of central stimulation.  Side effects
include coughing, bronchitis, emphysema, death, and smelly clothes.  Use
during pregnancy and breast-feeding is contraindicated, although one
cigarette immediately following conception is probably okay.  The second-hand
smoke inhaled by nearby non-smokers has been shown to be hazardous, and is
particularly annoying to those who are allergic or otherwise sensitive to
cigarette smoke, and are just trying to do their job without having to
breathe someone else's personal pollution.

	These forms of chemical abuse cannot be ignored any longer by Atari
Games Corporation.  Therefore, on Monday we will be conducting tests to weed
out the "druggies" in our company.  These tests will be as private and
non-invasive as possible, but you will understand if there is some slight
discomfort or embarassment involved.  It will be necessary to take blood,
urine, and fecal samples, as well as a small amount of liver, lung, and brain
tissue for analysis.  Please refer any questions to my secretary, April. 

	Frankly, some of you have been behaving as if your bodies were your
own, and as if whatever you choose to eat, drink, inhale, sniff, or take
by enema were your own business.  Let me remind you that Atari Games is in
business to make money, not to support your decadent drug habits.  If you
damage your bodily tissues, you hurt our profit margin.  This we will not
tolerate.  Remember, you work for us.

	Atari Games.  We own you.

  I am pleased to announce that Sam Comstock has been promoted to the 
position of Supervisor of Animation.  Sam has been with Atari for nearly five
years, and had eight years of animation experience prior to joining us.
  Sam came to us from LucasFilm, where he worked in the special effects
animation department on such films as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Return of
the Jedi.'  He started out at Atari in a consumer software group, working on
game graphics for Sesame Street cartridges for the Atari 2600 VCS. 
  Sam was transferred into Coin-op when we began work on computer generated
graphics for videodisc games.  He was responsible for the beautiful art which
was created for a videodisc version of Road Runner (which, unfortunately, was
never manufactured).  Since then, he has worked on a varitey of products, and
most recently completed both Xybots and Blasteroids.  Using his vocal talents,
he has also narrated or appeared in some of our sales and promotional video
tapes. 
  Please join me in congratulating Sam on his promotion, and please cooperate
with him as he assumes his new duties.

Subj:	Marty's mini-emulator


Marty asked me to give you my input on his proposed mini-emulator, probably
because at one time I was considering doing something similar.

If there is only going to be one built it is not a cost-effective use of
Marty's time.

Buying a cheap emulator would undoubtedly require an enormous amount of time
to debug and is, again, not a cost effective use of Marty's time.

If there are to be several made the danger is that various people will not 
be happy unless it duplicates or surpasses the functions of the AMS.
Doing a full scale emulator is not a cost effective use of Marty's time.

Making an emulator whose functions are transparent to the target hardware
is not trivial.

Subj:	how to save the company money

I'd appreciate it if someone could tell me who is in charge of
maintaining the grounds, and specifically who is in charge of the sprinkler
systems? I have pointed out that the sprinklers are watering the asphalt
several times but I must not have found the right person yet. 
It is particularly offensive in the face of a drought to see a sprinkler
head in front of the building discharging water at the rate of AT LEAST
50 gallons a minute directly into the gutter because it has been broken 
for months!! in addition, the watering cycle lasts so long the grass becomes
saturated and water just runs off. 

	THIS IS COSTING THE COMPANY MONEY!!!!

	while i'm at it, the faucet on the left in the executive rest room
gets stuck on very easily, which can easily waste a gallon/10 minutes.

thank you in advance for help finding the person responsible.

Subj:	MCI credit card calls (not AT&T)


	For the select few of you who have opted to get an MCI credit
card, you can now make credit card calls from our phone system.  You'll
note that there is a local number on the back of the card for you to call,
in order to get a dial tone for placing an MCI credit call.  This number
is now in the system speedcall directory.  So, to make such a call:

	Pick up the phone.  DO NOT DIAL 9.  Instead, dial #624 (four buttons,
pound, six, two, four).  This happens to be pound, M, C, I.  You must then
wait for the dial tone (different from the ones you get here).  Now dial
the number you want to call.  Again you'll get a tone.  Next, dial your
credit card number.  Your call will go through (and be billed to your card)
if you did it all right.  Contact me if you have problems with this procedure.

	For those of you concerned with AT&T cards:  This is possible because
it is a workaround.  I'll check into the possibility that AT&T has a similar
service;  I doubt that they find it necessary.  It is still the best I can
offer to dial #600 (pound six hundred) for an AT&T operator, and place the
call by voice (operator assisted).  There is a change in the works to make
it possible in a few months to dial some kind of access code like the MCI guys.

	As usual, if you have complaints or suggestions, let me know, and I'll
probably find a way to screw it up.

Subj:	MultiDIR/NEW-Sync H/W cost


In reviewing the MultiSync Hardware costing a couple of areas appear low,
and I would expect them to be issues for contnetion at the initiation meeting.
I would recommend revising them.

1) 27512 OTP EPROMS: I checked with Rod Petersen, and we have never bought
	27512 OTP's for less than $4.80. We have a supply at that price through
	September. After that, the price goes to $5.30. I suggest using $5.30.
	I also suggest costing the elctronic hardware WITHOUT EPROMS since 
	the price and quantity can vary so much. I suggest that the EPROM Cost
	should be a separate item on the final assembly cost estimate placed
	right under the elctronics cost. 

2) SRAMs: As of today, on Vindicators which is in production, 8k x 8 SRAMS
	vary in cost from $5 for 100 nS to $8 for 55 nS. Gary has a qoute on
	Toobin (production in June) for 1k x 4, 25 nS SRAMs of $7.65. I 
	have no information to forcast where SRAM cost are going, but 
	prudence suggests using a cost around $5-6.

3) Raw PCB cost: The lowest price we have for a recent PCB purchase (Blasteroids)
	was $.34 per sq. inch. this was a small PCB (100 sq. in.) and they 
	made them "2-up" to reduce cost. A recent quote on the larger Toobin
	PCB (200 sq. in.) came to $.38 per sq. in. I suggest revising Mult-sync
	PCB costs accordingly.

Subj:	conversion of Mac pictures to RAD format


Have you got some Mac pictures you want to use in your game?
Yes:
  Have I got a tool for you.
  mac_to_rad will convert 3 different kinds of Mac pictures to RAD format:
    > color pictures produced by PixelPaint, one of the greatest paint
      tools on this planet.  It can convert a file with up to 256 colors down 
      to 16 colors.
    > grey scale scanned pictures
    > MacPaint (1 bit deep) format black/white pictures.
  It's easy to use.  Practically all you need to know is the name of the file 
  you want to convert.
  To learn more about mac_to_rad,
  print charm$userdisk:[theurer.mac]mac_to_rad.doc
No:
  Why would anybody want to use Mac pictures?  A few reasons:
  > better looking text: there's hundreds of fonts in MacPaint format
  > need pictures scanned in & don't want to trace them: the scan conversion
    process (on the Dest scanner in Pubs) takes about 10 minutes.  It works 
    PERFECTLY with line drawings.  It does 16 level grey scales also.

about three days.  Our options of lead plating are tin and gold (gold being
nearly twice as much).  I said we would prefer the tin plating but we don't
know what Japan has in stock.  Question:  Can you afford to wait a few more
days for tin if it turns out that they only have gold in stock?  I will call

The three days mentioned above is travel time only.

Subj:	RE: IC sockets, 24ckt/.400


	The sockets will be requested by FAX this afternoon.  The Japan factory
is closed today so won't act on the request until Monday.  The tin plated leads
are usually the ones that they stock.  I was told that this socket is not stocked
in the U.S. and orders should be placed early.

	Your sockets are available from JAE, Japan, and will take about two
weeks.  They wish to stock their southern California facility at this time
for our use later this year.  Can you take a guess at our usage for the next
six to eight months?  They also want to know when they will receive a
purchase order for the 320 parts.  I promised to return their call this

Each game uses 32 sockets.

We expect to be in production within the next six months.

I expect we will produce at least 1,000 games.

If you will provide me with ordering information I will find someone to
order them.

	Thanks,

	It's officially working.  Atari Games people can call
Tengen people office-to-office without using outside lines
(we pay for each and every outside call, even local ones).
It works the other way too.

	The good news:  You may dial any Tengen extension
(including 0 for operator) following a 6.  Because we knew
this was coming, the extensions are all three digits, so a
four digit number starting with a 6 is a Tengen phone.
They can also call over here, by preceding your extension
with a 6 (they already know this).

	The bad news:  we cannot forward phone calls between
facilities.  This may or may not be coming in the near future.

	Things you should know:
		There is a delay between the connection to the
tie line and the time Tengen hears Atari people (it doesn't seem
to be as bad the other way).  This may (or may not) change.
		DON'T transfer outside calls over tie lines.
As soon as you drop out, so does the outside call!  This also
applies to conference calls.
		Once a tie line is involved, you CANNOT FLASH.
So, any features like add-on, consultation calling, hold, are
unavailable to you while talking to Tengen people.

	James has already included Tengen people and numbers in
the Atari Games phone list.  THESE ARE NOT OUTSIDE NUMBERS.  You
can't get to them through Pacific Bell.  Tengen has one outside
number, (408)435-2650.  This goes to their switchboard, and the
desired party or extension must be asked for.  If you wish to give
out a number for Tengen, this is the ONLY number.  Methinks the
64xx number group has been issued to Hewlett Packard.

	Calls going over the ties are treated as inside calls by
both systems.  For those who can tell what extension a call is coming
from, incoming Tengen calls come from extensions starting with 0
(so they can't be dialed).  You can't tell what Tengen extension
is calling you; and they can't tell who we are (we have strange
extension numbers over there, too).

	When you have problems (notice I didn't say IF), let me
know.  To save all of us some time, I already know that there is
a delay between everybody being able to hear.  Sometimes the call
doesn't go through, for no known reason (dial again).  In this event,
you'll hear their error tone, which is similar to ours, but markedly
different.  You'll be able to tell whose switch didn't like what you
did.  You won't be able to do anything about it.

I just released v2.5 of LLF. There are no functional differences between
this and previous versions. This one is a VAX re-make of the sources after
all the changes were installed during the port to MS-DOS, Atari/ST, etc.

I added a couple of bits in the .OB/.LB file format to accomodate the
new MAC65. If you use the /ERROR option on the command line while you
are LLF'ing an old .OB or .LB file, you will be notified that the object
file format is obsolete and you should remake it. You can choose to
remake the file(s) in question or ignore the message.

Attention 6502 programmers! The is a request for volunteers to test the
new native mode MAC65. It's substantially faster than the old one, however,
there are also some substantial differences that you may not care for at
this time. If you are using the HLL65F macros, the new one won't work yet.

You can print or vu CHARM$USERDISK:[SHEPPERD.MACXX]NEWMAC65.TXT for

Thanks for the huge response to my hex calculator request for information.

The results are :

HP 16C, programmable, $70 approx. : four people say its great (if you 
				don't mind paying the price.)

Casio CS-100, solar powered, $15-20 at Best : six people reported that 
				it does the job and you can't beat the price. 
				Lots of people here are using this one.

Casio fx-451 : Favoured by one, its the only one that has all the

Subj:	A new downloader


This is specifically to 6502 programmers. I have released a new blue box
downloader (the vax end) that will accept any file type that the DIO/IMI
will accept, including .VLDA. This downloader also allows for a third
parameter that is an address to which to download. For example, the
blue box command for a download might be:

	{ filename 10000 10FFF 8000 } vlda load

which would download the data in the file from hex 10000 to 10FFF to
memory addresses 8000 to 8FFF. This effectively does a block move
of the raw data, it doesn't relocate any symbolic addresses. You
may find this useful when downloading different banks for the FC.

Subj:	Hardware meeting summary notes


The original of this document will reside (for a few months) at 
	KIM$USERDISK:[MCCARTHY.HARDWARE]hdw52788.mtg


	Report on Hardware meeting on 5/27/88

Attendees : Albaugh, Downend, Hoff, Ly, Mc Carthy, 
		Paauw, Snyder, Stempler, Theurer.

Summary of discussions:

. Planned deactivation of components from the AVL .
Components group are currently reworking the AVL to fully implement an
Active/Inactive catagorization. Pat Mc Carthy will recieve a list of 
all 137xxx and 37-xxx parts to make an initial pass at determinimg 
what parts will be active. This will then be reviewed by all the 
other engineers. The exact mechanism has not been determined.
There were a whole bunch of questions ranging from "What happens 
when  we reach 137999-xxx", to "How does an inactivated part be made 
active (CER?)".
A little (or a lot) of information from components about what is 
happenning would be appreciated. 

. Industry RAM shortage .
There continues to be a shortage of Static RAMs. 8Kx8, 55nS and 70nS 
were recently a problem. If anyone has current price/availability on 
any RAM ICs mail it out. Maybe we can log it in a central place and 
keep track of RAM trends on an ongoing basis.

. Stamp hardware integration (MOB et al.) forum .
Pat Mc Carthy successfully introduced the MOB asic on 5/23. Vendor 
selection will take palace by 6/3. At the same meeting a standard 
chip set for stamp hardwares (standard and medium res.) was suggested 
and favourably received. The chip set would probably comprise 5 chips 
(MOB, VAD, PRI, SAS, LB2). Initial work has been done by Pat and Doug 
in determining the functional divisions of the chips. The following 
expressed a willingness to be involved on some level. Contribution 
levels are : level 1 - Discussion group only, level 2 - Discussion 
group and possible IC design, level 3 - Total involvement.
Sam Ly	: 	Level 1 
Pat Mc Carthy: 	Level 3 (MOB chip in process )
Doug Snyder : 	Level 2 (possibly the PRIority chip )
Don Paauw : 	Level 1.5 (back end involvement & maybe the SAS chip)
Gary Stempler : Level 2 (Possibly the VAD chip)
Mike Albaugh :	Level 1.
If anyone else wishes to contribute some effort please let Pat know.

As soon as we have something to offer, the programmers will get involved.

. Classes, Matrix of hardwares .
The subject of doing classes was once again brought up. After much 
discussion (and with direction from Chris Downend) we decided that we 
would do one and see what the interest level was. Pat and Rusty will 
prepare something for a ROMALOT class.

. Standardization of TTL families .
The list of TTL families is large. We need some consensus on which
families are preferrable for stocking purposes in engineering, and
make full use of the economies of scale on production. The general
agreement was : 7400 and 74L00 series should not be used (except for
7406, 7407) and we do not need to maintain stock of them. 
The preferred families to use, in order of preference are :
1. 'LS00 series
2. 'F00 series
3. 'AS00 series
"F" parts were preferred over "S" because of better cost/performance.
'S00, 'ALS00, 'C00, 'HC00 and 'HCT00 series will still be used where 
necessary. This is not a Golden rule. It is a voluntary convenience 
to help reduce costs and maintain better stock.

. Earl .
Earl Vickers is leaving sometime in June.

. Next meeting .
Interest level in these meetings as expressed by attendees is high. We
will continue to try to do one every month or two, preferrably the
last Wednesday of the Month. Anyone can call a meeting. Just send out
a VAX mailer to sys$mail:HARDWARE with your suggested topic or topics.

If you received this mail then you are on the sys$mail:hardware 
distribution list, probably because you asked to be on it at some 
time. There is no obligation to come to a meeting just because you 
are on the list. We will try to publish summaries. If you have some 
contribution to make (or complaint to air) about hardware topics just 
come on down. Technicians, programmers, managers etc. are all welcome.

Subj:	phone problems


	MCI, our long distance carrier, has had some fiber optic cables cut
between Hayward and San Fransisco.  San Fransisco is apparently the nearby
distribution center for regional traffic.  A portion of our access to the
world is therefore cut off.

	Calls within the 408, 415, and 707 areas are not affected.  Any other
call (including international) will find a higher rate of busy rejection. 
Since it is external to our system, you can't camp on.

	This happened early this morning.  At first, it seemed like we wouldn't
be affected much at all, but as the busiest period of the day (now, you guessed
it) approached, our access dropped to nearly nil.  While writing this memo,
I've been asked 7 times for a workaround, and also have spoken to MCI about it.

	The good news is that the problem will be fixed by this evening (they
estimate 6 PM).  And the workaround is to wait if you can, because in order
to make a call, you must dial the Atari operator and ask her for the long
distance operator.  Then you must make an operator-assisted call--tell the
long distance operator the number you need and she will connect you.  If she
says you can dial direct, tell her our lines are down and you can't.  They'll
be hearing that a lot today.  A word to the wise:  Operator assisted long
distance is one of the most expensive calls you can make.

	In summary: If you need to call out of the 408, 415, or 707 areas:
Wait til tomorrow if you can;  otherwise dial 0 and tell Robin or Yvette
that you need an AT&T operator.  They'll connect you, and tell them what
number you want.

	This offer expires at the end of today (they will NOT connect you
to an AT&T operator after the lines are repaired).

Subj:	more phone stuff


	The AT&T operators are known to tell people, "If you dial
10-ATT or 10288, you can dial direct."  WE CAN'T.  Our switch is too
old.  It was designed, built, and programmed long before the phone
network breakup.  We are getting an upgrade which should make it
possible, but we don't have it yet.  If you want to make a long distance
call (non 408, 415, 707), and it has to be today, it has to be done
by voice.  If they insist, tell them you want the call to be
operator-assisted (cuz we'll pay for it that way anyways).

	Please tell those who need to know but don't read VAXmail regularly.

Subj:	MCI lines


	... have been repaired.  You may now dial direct.
MCI warns that since the lines were down yesterday, traffic is 
expected to be a little heavy today.  If you encounter a
busy signal provided by the outside network, simply try again
in a few minutes.  To make things a little easier, you may
use the SAVE/REPEAT functions;  when you get the outside busy,
FLASH, and dial a pound-4.  You'll be reconnected to the busy
signal.  Hang up.  When you want to try again, simply dial pound-7
(don't dial 9 first).  Your saved phone number will be dialed instead.
This should work for any outside call, including international.
By the way, this feature is available and useful all the time, not
just today.

	The Atari-operator-getting-the-long-distance-operator
offer has expired.  They are no longer supposed to extend calls
to the long distance operator for you, so please don't put them in
the uncomfortable position of explaining it to you--don't ask them to.

	Please pass the word.

Subj:	Part numbers pending inactive status


Components Engineering has begun the process of trimming the fat from the QPL
by inactivating Atari part numbers for ICs that are no longer used or are
obsolete. These parts will be removed from the active QPL and placed on a
data base containing inactive parts.  From time to time I will send out a
mail messege that will refer you to a parts list in an EDT file in my
directory, [ARVIDSON.AVL.REVIEW]. The file is for your review and will
contain a list of ICs planned for inactive status.  If you feel that some
parts should remain active, please send me a listing of those parts.  Old
part numbers (37-xxxxx) remaining active will be converted to new part
numbers (137xxx-xxx). 

The first list of IC part numbers planned for inactivation can be found in
ERNIE$USERDISK:[ARVIDSON.AVL.REVIEW]9X-1.LIS.  They will be inactivated
in two weeks.

What does it mean for a part to be "Inactive"?

Does it mean it will not appear on the AVL in Datatrieve?

Does it mean that Manufacturing will scrap existing stocks of
said "Inactive" parts?

If I want to use an "Inactive" part will I have to fill out a CER?

Some of the parts I am using on Driver and Stun Runner are being reported
as "Inactive" They weren't "Inactive" when they were first put on the parts 
list.

What is the deal?

Subj:	Response to your questions.


What does it mean for a part to be "Inactive"?

	Inactive parts are placed on a database for presently unused or unspecified
	parts.  This means that they are not found on MANMAN or not known to be used
	on any project in development.  The new-project parts lists as found in PC
	Design directories are researched to determine parts used in projects under
	development.  If a part was inadvertently removed, it will be replaced.

Does it mean it will not appear on the AVL in Datatrieve?

	Inactive parts and obsolete parts are removed from the AVL but not from
	Datatrieve.  They are merely transferred from the database containing active
	or frequently used parts to a database for unused parts.  There are six
	databases used and here are their Datatrieve names:  reserved parts = DB3, 
	active parts = DB4,  inactive parts = DB5, obsolete parts = DB6,  spare
	parts/marketing = DB7,  approved vendors/part numbers = DB8.  DB8 contains
	a status code for all vendors' part numbers:  0 = approved,  1 = restricted,
	2 = temporary,  3 = disqualifed.  When accessing Datatrieve directly, it is
	important to look at the status code.  For a complete explanation see 
	Rick Meyette or Jeff Bell.  

Does it mean that Manufacturing will scrap existing stocks of
said "Inactive" parts?

	No.  Removing seldom-used parts from the active list just clears the clutter
	from the database.  It does not effect the physical inventory.

If I want to use an "Inactive" part will I have to fill out a CER?

	I think not.  A message or note to Jeff should do it.  Ask Jeff or Rick
	Meyette for details.  

Some of the parts I am using on Driver and Stun Runner are being reported
as "Inactive" They weren't "Inactive" when they were first put on the parts 
list.

	Send a list to Jeff and it should be taken care of.

What is the deal?

	The purpose is to reduce the enormous size of the approved parts list, 
	remove seldom-used or obsolete parts and speed up searches.  Included
	in this clean-up process is the conversion of old part numbers 
	(37-xxxxx, etc.) to new (137xxx-xxx, etc).  All of this was started
	on 4-6-88 and the job must be complete by 10-6-88.

Subj:	VADRS chip in prototype fabrication and 256k VDRAM shortfall


VADRS and 256k VDRAM's:
	Purchasing's difficulty in getting 256k VDRAMS for the "DRIVER" project
in Q3, Q4 88 has alerted me to the analogous potential problem for Sys3d in '89.
The word from TI's Jon Henricks (Field Sales Engineer) is that fab lines are
being converted from 256k DRAM and VDRAM to 1M DRAM and VDRAM, that the parts
are hard to get now and will be harder to get in the future. This is just one 
vendor's plan.
	The VADRs chip is currently on the fabrication path.  It is useless
without 256k 120ns Video RAMS.  It will not work with 1M Video RAMS.  Using 1M
parts would require redesign starting at the TTL prototype stage and would take
an estimated 9 monthes to get to engineering samples.  The other chips in the
system will work with 256k or 1M or ... video RAMS (Sorter, Gobot, Zippy,
Clippy, Maggie). Dave and I are contacting vendors (Hitachi, TI, Fujitsu, Mits,
NEC, Toshiba) and working with purchasing to get a feel for 256k VDRAM
availability in '89, '90. 

	Consequently, I asked Robert Pescosolido to investigate 
	what we could do to suspend the VADRS.  He has put the VADRS 
	fabrication on hold just prior to mask making. 

Suspension of the job incurs no additional cost, avoids the mask
charges (10 - 15K) and will not impact the Sys3d video schedule if the hold is 
release before GOBOT CIF is released (expected at the end of August).
	I expect/hope that once the VDRAM vendor information is in, and the tea
leaves are read, we will feel adequately comfortable in releasing the VADRS for
fab. 
	Also, Mary Burnias has offered to invite the vendors in individually to 
discuss their plans for the 256k VDRAM's.  Who wants to attend these sessions?  
I'd like to get a head count by the end of Thurs  6/9.  

----------

Rick and Jed, I think only TI has come in to discuss long term 256k VDRAM plans 
with you and that the suggested vendor sessions would not duplicate your prior efforts.  
Is that correct?

Subj:	Downtime


The good news is some of the new disk space has arrived. The bad news is that
I'll need to take down Kim, Gawd, Ernie and Icy for unspecified intervals at
various times over the next few days. This is going to be a painful and time
consuming process and take a great deal of cabling and re-cabling to get the
whole thing to work. So you'll get a better feel for what I'm up against, 
here's what has to be done:

	Format and verify the new disks (in process 6-8, hours/drive).
	Shutdown Gawd and hookup the new drives to it, reboot.
	Dismount (logically) Kim's userdisk from the cluster.
	Mount Kim's userdisk and the new disks on Gawd only.
	copy all the files from kim to the new disks (should take about
		3-4 hours).
	Mount the new disks on the cluster as KIM$USERDISK.
	Shutdown Kim and disconnect the 2 drives that were KIM$USERDISK.
	Adjust all hardware and software parameters indicating that Kim
		has only 1 disk and reboot.
	Format and verify these disks so they can be plugged into a
		different controller (6 hours/drive or so).
	Shutdown Ernie and hookup one of the newly formatted disks in
		place of ERNIE$DUA1:, reboot Ernie standalone mode.
	Copy ERNIE$DUA0 to the new ERNIE$DUA1 (will take about 2 hours),
		disconnect ERNIE$DUA0, hookup the old ERNIE$DUA1 and reboot.
	Shutdown ICY. Pull all the boards out of Icy and Bib (Bib has been
		shutdown since yesterday) and trade cabinets. Hookup the
		drive removed from Ernie (needs no reformatting) and the
		other drive from Kim to Icy. Hookup the little drive that
		was on Icy to Bib. Adjust software letting Icy and Bib know
		that they now have disks and reboot them.

As you might well imagine, this is going to take SOME time to complete and
due to vacation conflicts, I'd like to get going on it immediately. I
propose the following schedule, and if unless there are some serious 
objections, this it roughly what'll happen:

	Beginning tonight (6/10/88) 19:00 - shutdown Gawd and dismount
		Kim$userdisk. The copy from Kim to gawd will run overnight.
	Tomorrow (6/11/88) 10:00-12:00 Kim will be down to disconnect
		drives.
	Icy will be shutdown from about noon saturday until monday.
	When or if the Zippy DRC batch job currently running on Ernie
		completes on sunday, I'll begin the Ernie disk to disk
		copy. If not, then I'll do it next week.

In summary:
	This eve, Kim and Gawd will be down until about noon tomorrow.
	Icy will be down tomorrow through monday.
	Bib will be down until monday.
	Ernie will probably be down all day sunday.

Subj:	Mult-sync and VRAM's


A flag has been raised that 256K VRAMS as used in  Multi-sync are in short
supply now, and may become even scarcer as VRAM manufacturers convert 256K Fab
lines to 1MEG VRAM fab lines. Just in case this really happens, I would like
to know what contingencies we have, if any. 

1) Can Multi-sync be re-designed to use (1) 1Meg VRAM for (4) 256k VRAMs?
    if not...

2) Can Multi-sync be re-designed to use (1) 1Meg VRAM for (1) 256k VRAM?
	(and then only use 1/4 of the 1Meg part...ugh)

3) Are there software implications if the VRAM size changes? If so,
   what software changes and to what extent?

I am not really going to worry about this in a serious way until about January
'89. StunRunner production is tentatively planned in June '89. We would have
to start a PCB re-design in a January timeframe to have it ready for June 
production.

Subj:	Unix make now on VAX


For all those out there who are unix fans, I have just put a unix-like make
in utl$exe:umake.exe.

This is pretty much like UNIX make, with rules etc.
If you know the unix make go ahead and use it.
Otherwise I will post the documentation and send another mail message for
those who don't know UNIX make syntax but would like to learn.

The main advantage of unix make is that the makefiles are a lot shorter as
it knows how to make a .o (or .obj) from a .c so you don't have to specify
them in the makefile.

(Note for unix hackers, use $$ to get a $ in the method line).

		Any bug reports, requests to this address.

		Jim.

PS Any one have a machine readable form of unix make documenation??

Subj:	Documentaion for Unix make


Initial documention for the unix make (UMAKE) can be found in:

charm$userdisk:[morris.vaxutils.make]make.doc

This is not exactly the same, (No library or sccs support).
However it is mainly correct, especially for the sort of thing
we are likely to use it for.

I may update the doc file sometime in the future.
A good article on how to use make appears in a couple of issues
of the C users Journal. (I have a copy if you want to copy it).

Subj:	new hardware


	Does anyone out there have a need for growth/shrink motion objects for
up-coming game projects.  I have a new growth/shrink motion object hardware 
up and running and need to know what new projects may require such a hardware.
The current version is a medium-res hardware capable of filling about 2/3
of the screen with motion objects.  These objects are not position (scan-line)
limited and the grafix data is run-length encoded with 16 to 256 colors per
object.  Growth objects can vary from 1 to 16 times the data stored in the 
grafix ROM.  Shrink objects can vary from 1/64 to 63/64 times the data stored 
in the grafix ROM.  Objects are controlled with the standard parameter RAM 
control blocks.
	A lo-res version of this hardware would be capable of filling about
1 1/2 screens with motion objects.
	Depending on the complexity of the playfield and alphanumerics that
went along with the growth/shrink motion objects, the hardware would cost
about $150-$200 for lo-res and $250-$300 for medium-res.  Since the motion
object grafix are run length encoded, the cost of motion object grafix ROMs 
may be less than for standard hardwares.
	If you have a need, or think you may have a need for this type of
hardware, please respond to this address or x1790.
					Thanx,
					Doug

	We currently have two GPX's for use in IC design in the CAD lab.
One was slated to be moved into the new 3D lab and the other was to go into
one of the PPS rooms.  We also have two AED terminals but no CPU's to run
them on.  Morgan has asked that both of the GPX's be moved into the 3D lab.
The advantages to this would be keeping all of the IC resources together and
would make both GPX's convenient to the 3D team.  The disadvantage would be that
anyone needing a graphics terminal for other designs would need to intrude into
the 3D lab.
	I currently see very limited non-3D use for the second terminal:
Pat may need to do some touch-up on his gate array and Doug may need some time
for the ASAP at a later date.  Simulations, DRC's, etc could be run on the other
CPU's.
	If anyone has any strong feelings on the matter, please let me know.
Otherwise, we'll plan on moving both of the GPX's into the 3D lab along with
the manuals and the Versatec plotter.  The actual move won't take place for
at least two weeks.

Subj:	shredding of "confidential" papers


   An accident happened today when the shredding was put out for Mobile 
Shredding to shred, it was thrown in the dumpster!

   This was an unfortunate misunderstanding but the question been asked 
if it is necessary to search thru the muck to retrieve it, so it can be 
shredded before throwing it away.  I don't know so I'm asking for your 
opinion; send replies to OHARA, or a note in the mail will do and I will 
forward them on and keep record for future reference.

   While I'm on my soapbox a couple of other points:

       A.  I see no reason why end sheets need to be shredded, yet 1/3 to 1/2 
of the shredding I pick up is just the sheets that come at the end of listings 
and such.  This cost the company $25 to 35 worth of corporate money each month 
or so ($400 a year or more).
       B.  The shredding is not trash despite the fact that it eventually ends 
up there, I do not appreciate the candy wrappers and such that seem to find their 
way into the shredding.

     enuff said and apologies to those who don't need to hear this

Item 1:
	Let me see if I have this right.

	You want to use expensive Programmers' time to separate the end sheets
	of program listings so you can save $25 per month?

	Also, I disagree that the end sheets are unimportant. The end sheets
	would allow an individual to know what programs people are working
	on. People generally choose program titles representative of
	their content. The end sheets would tell an industrial spy what programs
	to target for acquisition.

	I expect you are already saving more than $25 per month from the 
	execrable printer paper you bought.


Item 2:
	As I understand it, the reason for shredding things is to prevent them
	from falling into the hands of our competitors.

	I use the shred pile to get rid of old schematics (although, 
	fortunately, not this month).

	I would not like the result of my last two years' work wasted because
	you did not think it was all that important to have things properly 
	shredded.

     Thank you all for your responses, it is clear to me that alot could be read
 into a name.  I will make sure that things are taken care of more responsibly
 in the future.
     However, wouldn't it be more confidential to shred things right away, for
 example; have a shredder in the printer room (they are made to feed like trash
 cans and are somewhat sealed so the dust is minimal and don't sound any louder
 then a line printer these days) and shred the stuff daily and have the janitors
 throw it away every night.  This would heighten the security of our operation
 somewhat, since it now stacks up in the warehouse until there are enough boxes
 to make it worthwhile to call Mobile Shredding, the boxes are unattended, and
 not locked up (no room for this).

	I just received a quote for prototyping four samples of the three-turn (3)
potentiometer:  $250   approx. 5 weeks ARO.  Normally the charge is $1000.  They
recommend prototyping the 3-turn because it's easier and faster to do than the
3.5-turn.

	If the resolution is satisfactory on the 3-turn samples, then it will
also be satisfactory on the 3.5-turn.  The choice of 3 or 3.5 will then be based
on the steering wheel stops.

	As soon as a purchase requisition is written, I will order the samples.

Subj:	Shredding


We had our own shredder and did our own shredding. When it broke the company
decided not to fix it because sending it out was supposedly cheaper.

By the way, the printer room is scheduled to disappear. The printers will go
in the computer room. (Bad place for a shredder.)

Nonetheless, it would be nice to have our own shredder again.

     I agree, new shredders have been sealed somewhat to cut down on the dust
 whether this is enough or not I don't know.  Also a shredder up to the volume
 we seem to generate costs about $3 or 4 grand.
     Also, please except my apologies for snapping back at you yesterday.
                                       thanks

Subj:	Current 1 MEG EPROM Prices


Mary Burnias gave me this information today:

1) 1 MEG EPROM, 200 NS, 32-pin, 128kx8:

  TOSHIBA:  TC571000D-20/TC571001D-20, 10K QTY. $23.35 each
  HITACHI:  HM27C301-20,	       10K QTY. $19.50 each

2) By comparison:
   
   (2) 27512-200 EPROMs cost  about $13.00  (6.50 each)
   (2) 27512-200 OTPs   cost  about $10.70  (5.35 each)
   (1) 231000-200 ROM   costs about $ 4.15  (plus $3500 mask chrg, 2500 min qty)

3) CONCLUSION: 1 MEG EPROMs are still not cost-effective compared to an 
	       equivalent number of bits in 27512's.

4) Mary is getting more quotes.

Subj:	VRAM Sockets


  1. According to Erwin, JAE #DICF-24C without the E2 suffix is 0.6" 
     wide instead of 0.4" wide. There are therefore not useable.

  2. Rick and I have decided that we will build the first 100 games with 
     sockets for the VRAMs (32 per) and solder the parts in thereafter 
     (unless there are problems with the VRAMs or if manufacturing objects).

  2. There are other parts with 12 (or more) week lead times. 12 week
     lead times on the sockets would be ok.

  3. JAE has lied about the availability of sockets before. When I needed
     320 for prototypes in May they promised two week delivery. I actually
     received them last week. I would just as soon not buy anything from them.

  4. Erwin says he gave you information on sockets with machine tooled pins.
     Please look for it and find out cost and delivery for 3200 pieces.

  5. While I am generally not available in the morning, I am here every 
     afternoon and most evenings. I read my VAX mail every day and I always 
     respond to messages sent to my attention.

  6. The following is the AVL entry for the VRAM socket, 179258-014:

Mary Burnias has procured (10) 1 meg EPROM samples for internal use. See me
if you need some. They are Mitsubishi M5M27C100K-150:
	- 128K x 8
	- 150 nS
	- 32-pin package
	- A16 is on pin 24 which makes them more compatible with a 
		28-pin 1 meg ROM.
	- CMOS, 50mA active, selected
Mary gave me a data sheet too.

Since 1 meg EPROMS cost around $20.00, there are not viable in production 
products, but they can be used in prototypes and in ROM verification and/or
hardware verification situations. The equivalent memory in (2) 27512's 
costs $12.00 total. This is for 200nS parts in both cases.

Subj:	MAC65 7.3


Just released, MAC65 7.3. This version has two bugs fixed. One was were
it was incorrectly reporting errors on numbers greater than the current
radix and the other was were it was incorrectly handling null operands
in .BYTE, .WORD and .LONG directives (it should have stuck in 0's).

I've changed the feature where statements with undefined opcodes, macros,
or psuedo-ops were assumed to be .WORD's. Instead an error message will be
printed. If you relied on that feature, you can turn it back on with 

	.ENABL .WORD		;re-enable the .WORD feature

Commas between arguments on .BYTE, .WORD and .LONG are optional now. The
macro case such as:

	.MACRO SOME A B C D E F
	.word B D F
	.ENDM

will not generate errors or extra 0's if, for example, the arguments D and F
are blank. (It will generate a single word of 0 if B is also blank).

The up-arrow character (^) means different things at different places in
the source. In a MACRO argument, it means the following non-space character
is the delimiter to the macro argument. For example:

	macro_call ^\argument with spaces and commas in it\

means to pass all the text between the two '\'s as argument 1 to the macro.
This has been a problem where you want to pass an ^ as an argument to a
macro (such as ^H0F0). I added a funtion whereby you can change the escape
character to something else to avoid these collisions. For example:

	.MESCAPE expression	;expression must resolve to a value
				;between 0x21 to 0x7E
	.MESCAPE '~		;changes it to tilda

The previous escape character is saved (one level of nesting). You can
restore the previous escape character by using the .MESCAPE op without an
argument. For example:

	.MESCAPE '~		;change escape char to tilda
	.INCLUDE FILE		;input file that has ^'s in macro args
	.MESCAPE		;restore the escape char

One other change, which I made under protest and would be happy to put back, is
in the checking of overflow. Values placed into a byte must now be between the
values -128 <= n <= 255 and values placed into a word must be between the values
-32768 <= n <= 65535. It used to allow bytes of -256 <= n <= 255 and words
-65536 <= n <= 65535. You may be irritated with error messages if you use the
^C (1's compliment) operator in any of your expressions that have bits 7 or 
15 set.

Subj:	New test pieces from Sega


Two new test pieces are testing at this very moment down at Emerald
Hills Golfland.  Both are from Sega.

1)  Dynamite Dux- looks like a potential kit.  Joystick and two buttons.
                  One button jump and the other is punch.  Gameplay is
                  a Woody Woodpecker character that roams the streets
                  picking up treasures, bombs, guns, and other items
                  using these for fire power against oncoming so-called
                  enemies.  These enemies are believe it or not, moose
                  heads and dog heads.  At the end of the first wave, there
                  is a big Mr. Fire Blaze that he character must put out
                  with the water guns he picks up.  

                  The game is a two player on 25 cents per play.  Not
                  one person played the game while I was there.


2)  Power Drift-  Another expensive looking driving game from Sega.
                  This one is an Outrun perspective dune buggy type
                  driving game.  Has the same graphics as Galaxy Force.
                  These graphics make the game very difficult to play
                  because they are so washed out and it is hard to
                  get a good feel for the track.

                  The player chooses from 5 categories of tracks and
                  starts on one of five tracks within that category.
                  Player must place in what appeared to be a predetermined
                  finish before he can continue.

                  The game has steering wheel, shifter, gas and brake pedals.
                  Coinage is set on 50 cents per play.

If you all have a chance to go out and see these games please do so.  Capcom
is also testing Rough Ranger at Emerald Hills.  This is the Rolling Thunder
rip-off.


Oh ya, one more thing.  SNK just had a distrib. meeting introducing P.O.W.
It is another low priced game for us to compete against.  Price will be
$1995ish.

Subj:	COLOR PRINTER


Subject: DIY COLOR printing
From: Dave Theurer    [theurer.cop.tek]tek.doc
Date: 8/25/88

We now own a Tektronix 4693D color printer (300 dots/inch thermal wax transfer).
We have the capability to print RAD and PIF files from the VAX via an IBM PC.
Within 3 weeks the IBM PC will be removed from the path and we will have a 
direct connection from the VAX to the Tektronix printer.
Each page costs 35 cents.
Please give me your suggestions for making the following procedure better.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary procedure:

1> Take your RAD or PIF file and create a TEK print file:
   a> On the VAX, "run [theurer.cop.tek]tek".  Answer the "20 questions".
      See discussion at end for more info on this program.

2> Turn on the PC:
   a> Turn it on.  Wait for the C:\> prompt.  Hit CR if it asks any questions.
   b> Type at the C:\> : cd \tek

2> Send the TEK print file from the VAX to the PC: (~~ 90 seconds)
   a> Type NFT and wait for the NFT> prompt.
   b> Type at the NFT> : copy charm::[directory-of-your-TEK-file]your-TEK-filename.TEK
      Enter your password if it asks.
      This takes about a minute.  Wait for the NFT>.
   c> Type at the NFT>: exit

3> Send the TEK print file from the PC to the Tektronix: (~~ 90 seconds)
   On the PC:
   a> Type at the C:\TEK> totek your-TEK-filename.TEK
      This takes about a minute.  The Tektronix should say IMAGING at this time.
      When it's done sending, it'll say C>\TEK again. 
   b> Type at the C:\TEK> del your-TEK-filename.TEK
      If you don't do this we'll quickly run out of disk space on the PC.

4> Turn off the PC:
   a> Type at the C:\TEK> park
   b> Turn it off.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"20 questions" program:

> NOTE: most of the questions have a default which will work.  Just hit CR.
> Takes cells from RAD or PIF files and lays them out on a big bitmap(whose
  size you specify), adds some information, then converts the bitmap into a 
  TEK print file.
> Range of cells to print:
  > You can print any range or combination of ranges of cells.
> It lays your cells out from left to right, top to bottom on the bitmap.
  You specify size of gaps:
  > between cells
  > around the edge (borders)
> Bitmap size:
  > You specify the size of your bitmap in pixels.  The program makes a guess 
    for you, but it doesn't guess very well if you have a lot of cells of 
    different sizes, or a lot of really big cells.  <to be improved>
  > The printer expands your bitmap to fill the page, maintaining the original
    aspect ration.  If you give it a small bitmap, it will get magnified more 
    than if you give it a big one. 
    > A page can contain 2440 x 3198 dots, so if your bitmap is 
      > 1000x1000 it gets magnified 2.44 X.
      >  500x500  it gets magnified 4.88 X.
  > To get a picture in portrait orientation that looks about the same scale as 
    > lo res game screen use size 175,228 (lo res game screen is 21 dots/inch)
    > RAD screen use size 520,680	(RAD screen is 64 dots/inch)
  > NOTE: if you are going to print several pages and you want them all to be
    the same size, you MUST SPECIFY THE SAME SIZE BITMAP for each page.
  > NOTE: if there isn't enough room on the bitmap you specified for all the
    cells you want, it gives you a warning but doesn't generate the second page.
    You have to rerun the program for subsequent pages. <to be improved>
> You specify picture orientation on page:
  > portrait print area is 8.13" x 10.66" (for skinny pictures)
  > landscape print area is 10.66" x 8.13"  (sideways printing) (fat pictures)
> You specify aspect ratio (for those pictures with rectangular pixels).
> It inserts cell info(cell # and size) at the bottom left corner of each cell 
  if you request a vertical cell-to-cell gap of at least 10 pixels.
> It inserts an "info zone" containing palette & file info  at the bottom of 
  the bitmap:
  > You get to specify the height of this "info zone" in pixels.  If the
    program needs more room for the cells you specify, it will rob from this
    info zone.  If there is extra room, the program will expand the height of 
    the palettes.
  > It inserts a palette for each set of 16 colors used.  The height of each
    palette depends on how high you specify the "info zone" to be.  
  > It inserts file information below the palette.
> Grids:
  > Tic marks around the edge of each cell may be requested if you don't want
    to mar your picture.
  > Grid lines through the picture may be requested.
  > You specify the grid spacing, grid color, and grid origin.
  > NOTE: if you want tics, you must specify at least 1,1 cell-to-cell
    separation, and a top/bottom border of at least 1.
> NOTE: there are a few color matching problems (for purplish bluy especially)
  which can be fixed if somebody will volunteer to do a color translation
  algorithm.

Subj:	bugs in gen_eer.asm


	Apparently Cyberball was the first project to use more than
two High score tables with the "official" code. There were bugs in 5
of the 8 (10?) places where I had conditional assembly. It's going to
take a while to re-merge their fixed version with the "mainstream" code,
so PLEASE let me know if you are "privately" maintaining your own copy.
I will then let YOU know what needs to change to maintain compatability.
I was hoping to put this off until I had MAC68K (my kingdom for ifdf!)
but obviously it can't wait...
				Sorry, (AGAIN!)

Subj:	Party Time


Well, its party time again:

"Tropical Iniberation II, this time its personal!" will be held at the home
of Owen Rubin on Spet. 24th starting at 2:30 P.M. The rules are simple:
1). Bring swim suit and towel to use the pool.
2). Bring something to burn, uh, cook, on the BBQ for dinner.
     (Hambuger and hot dog buns will be provided as well as all necessary
     add on's)
3). Bring something to throw into a blender which "could" be used to make a
    tropical drink (strawberrys, peaches, coconuts, bananas, pinapple, etc.)
4). You may pass on 2 & 3 above and bring a blender instead (it will be returned
    but it may be a bit sticky!!). I will provide hambugers and hot dogs.
    (I need about 5 blenders and this offer is good to the first 5 to 6 people
    who RSVP as such.)
5). Bring along a side dish to share (if your so inclined) as this will ease my
    work load. I will be providing the following: LOTS of ice, rum, vodka,
    sodas and waters (some beer will be available), chips, nuts, vegetables,
    and other assorted munchies as I happen to find at the Price Club.
6). Children are always welcome.
7). Maps will be available or you may call for directions. I have not made a
    map at this time as CalTrans is not yet done rearranging the streets in
    my area and they are currently subject to change at any time (They have
    changed 3 times this week!)

As a special incentitive to attend, the first 40 or so adults that arrive at the
party will receive an official Tropical Iniberation II T-shirt. They are only
available in Large and in blue. If there is enough demand for additional
shirts, they will be available for $10.00 each after the first 40 are gone.

Please RSVP by Sept 17th so I may get a final count.
Days: (xxx)xxx-xxxx. Other times and messages: (xxx)xxx-xxxx.

-Owen-

Subj:	Compressing Archiver ZOO now on VAX


A new utility called ZOO is now in utl$exe.

It creates a very tightly compressed archive of files.
 e.g.
$ zoo a t.zoo *.*  - this will save all the files in the current directory
		     in the archive called t.zoo.

It remembers the directories the fils were in and can be used to save
directory trees.

It produces more tightly compressed data than ARC.
It is also available in source form, and executables for amiga, IBMPC, XENIX.
(See me for source).

The full documentation is in DOK:ZOO.DOC

To use it do

$ ZOO:== $utl$exe:ZOO.EXE

in your login.com file.

$ zoo h

prints out a help message.

	Save disk space, archive all your seldom used files into a
	zoo archive!!

	Jim.

     From what has been seen around here some employees have been 
forced to go outside to have a cigarette.  I guess they haven't even
been told that there was a designated smoking area. 
     What's goin on?  Can we or can we not smoke cigarettes at our
own working area ie. office or cubicle?  I understand there must 
be a formal written company wide policy.  I do not recall ever
seeing one.

Subj:	smokers' rights


	It's hard to take seriously a complaint about lack of
information from someone who complains anonymously...

	There are some well known areas designated smoking and
non-smoking.  The most well known non-smoking area is the cafeteria.
The most well known smoking areas are the "facilities" offices.


Arbitrary question:
	Why do we need a formal policy established?  Can't you guys work
it out?  Since you seem to feel the need to repeat the question, here's a
suggestion to help you find a middle ground:

Suggestion for smokers:
	In deciding whether or not to smoke within your work area,
use a little common sense.  If you are the only smoker in your cube
group, please realize that all of your air is shared; step outside.
If you have roomies (cubies?) that smoke, they can't reasonably complain
if you do.  Take the temperature now and then, and see if anyone cares.

Suggestion for nonsmokers:
	If the smokers are in your cube area, let them know it bothers you,
and ask them to do it elsewhere.  If you/they are in different hardwall
offices, it shouldn't be potent enough to annoy you.  If you are particularly
sensitive to smells, ask them to close their door, and consider closing yours.
Either/both of you should put a post-it note or some other indication that
you are open for business, lest people are reluctant to interrupt a
closed-door meeting.  If your objection to smokers is that it "looks ugly",
then don't look.  Ugly is in the eye of the beholder, and you wouldn't
want everyone who didn't approve of your looks to gripe at you, would you?

Incidentally, don't bother trying to convince smokers to stop; they have been
beaten over the head with "it's bad for your health",  "it will kill you",
"it's offensive", and any other reason for quitting that you can think of.
If they haven't quit by this time, it isn't because they don't know; it's
because they don't want to quit anyways, or they can't.  As a former smoker,
I can guarantee they don't do it to annoy you, and it is very difficult to stop.
If they had a physical deformity or some other handicap, you would look past it.
Consider the addiction to tobacco in the same light.  By this time, they have
been told by everyone, including the voters at large.

SMOKE ARE SICK LESS OFTEN, MORE PRODUCTIVE. FINALLY, I WONDER WHAT THE LEGAL

Here's my 10 cents worth.

	One person smoking can affect a number of people not smoking.

	Isn't this a democracy????

Seriously I think the company should have a No Smoking Policy then
there would be less chance of employee conflicts, pass the buck to
the executive commitee.

Sorry if all you fanatical non-smokers are insulted!  I for one do like to
smoke when I do my heavy coding.  I find it helps my concentration.  I
think that anyone who is so upset about smoke, that they would deprive
others of that pleasure, even when it does not effect them directly is
on really stupid trip.  I feel that if I smoke in my lab and the smoke
does not reach others then I am doing my part.  I can't hear the line
about "the smoke goes into the ventalation system and then poisons
everyone", that is a bunch of B.S..  If you feel so strong about it, why
no just wage a war on smokers.  Start those campaigns, get your guns...

If I sound strong winded, then maybe you should reread the mail messages
that you "Non-smokers for a better universe" have send out!

I can't seriously believe that anyone here wants any kind of rules or
"policy". I thought we were all big kids now. I'm sure we can effectively
police ourselves. If we can't, what's a few fist fights now and then.
	Let's just do what we know best around here. Skip the effort of
making "policy" and let's make a new game, BLOOD WAR ON SMOKERS. 
	Think of the possibilities! Screen one: You are on BART, someone 
in your car lights up a cigarette, You push the trigger on your uzzi and
jelly blast the place. Violence sells!Let's get a team together and make
megabucks and forget this nitpicking.

Subj:	new mail station


     There is a new mail station in the hallway outside Components,
 towards the back of 675, it's designated 675-3 (the one by the
 Xerox 1055 is 675-2, the one in the open area in Engineering is
 675-1).  All mail for the five groups located back there;
 System 3D, Applied Research, Components, Prototype Assembly,
 Video Edit Lab, is delivered there.  Interoffice and US Postal
 Mail is also pick up there twice daily between 10-11am and 2-3pm.
 
     While I'm here I thought I might speak to some other subjects
 concerning mail of interest to you all:
	I pick up US Postal Mail 4 times daily in 675; not before
 9, and 10 in the morning (9am mail goes with me to the post office)
 not before 2 and 3:50 in the afternoon, 9am and 3:50pm I pick at the
 lobby.  735, 737 and Tengen, Inc. get mail Pick up twice daily after
 10am and 2pm.  If you can get it to my office by 4:20 pm it will go
 that day.
	First Class Mail should get to its destination in not more
 then Three Days,  International Air Mail takes 5 days altho this
 varies from Country to Country.
	Postal Express will get there within 24 hours (Sat, Sun
 and Holidays included!).
	I have a scale in my office which automatically gives the
 rates.

	Finally, a suggestion:  If you want your mail to be
 delivered in the morning or want to avoid the forwarding delay
 of 7 days when we move (I know that this is a long way off but
 address changes tend to be slow so...) then your address
 should be as follows:
		(your name)
		Atari Games Corporation
 optional:	### Sycamore Drive     	    ###= 675, 735, 737
                PO Box  361110
		Milpitas, CA.  95035-1110
	I mention this because after our physical move I will
 have to forward all street mail but will continue to pick up
 Box mail.  Also Box mail tends to come quicker, as it gets
 presorted in San Francisco (thats what 95035-1110 does for
 us)
                    Thank you (sorry to be so long winded)

Subj:	SMOKING POLICY ???????


   Before the ____ hits the fan and editorial opinion begins hitting the 
screens on terminals throughout the company, I'd like to make a couple
comments regarding the recently announced smoking policy.
   First of all, neither Lyle or myself had any input whatsoever regarding
that policy.  I personally have objections to singling out certain
departments as "non-smoking areas" while neglecting to mention others.
Does that mean that entire departments go on or off the "non-smoking list"
as department heads change from smokers to non-smokers, or vica versa??
   I also am quite puzzled as to why we had to issue a previously unknown
policy retroactively.  What does that say about those of us who have been
violating this policy for the last 3 weeks??
   And now for some personal editorializing of my own:

     1. Personally, I agree with the announced policy, other than the
        departmentalizing of non-smoking areas and the retroactive effectivity.
     2. I believe that each employee does have the right to work in an 
        environment where smoke does not endanger his health or significantly
        affect his comfort or productivity.
     3. I believe that smokers should have the right to smoke in areas where 
        they are not endangering anyone's health other than their own, nor
        significantly affecting anyone else's comfort or productivity.
     4. I wonder why I wasn't consulted regarding the Smoking policy??

Subj:	policy-making policies


	This is it.  This is where the smoke (what else?) hits the fan.
There are two things I want to say:  There are some additional oddities that
Dan was too couthful to point out, and I would like to make public my
extreme disappointment in the necessity of any policy at all.

First, the peculiarities that strike me:

	Since part of the policy's justification was to comply with Milpitas
law, which I have been told states that there is no smoking even in individual
offices, does that mean that Engineering (the largest "non-designated" area)
does not have to comply with the law?

	What are the penalties for non-compliance?  And are the violators of
the last three weeks excused from them?  If so, why not the next three weeks?
If not, what is the point of a post-dated rule, and when does it become
effective?

	What about the rights of non-smokers outside?  We're all on the same
planet, you know.  If I can tell if the guy on the other end of the building
is smoking because of the ventilation system, don't you think when we are
both outside, in the same room, so to speak, I can tell if he lights up?
Nevermind that each one of us comes to work in a motor vehicle that emits more
airborne poison by itself than all the smokers in the company combined, I
demand the right (as a non-smoker, thus given priority by the policy) to go
outside and breathe untainted, pure smog.  While I can't do anything about
the thousands of smokers we share the air with, the 20 or so that are
unfortunate enough to work at Atari MUST go through withdrawal or leave the
Santa Clara valley.  Again, since I am a non-smoker, I have precedence, and
therefore, this is automatically the new policy.

	Exactly where is the designated smoking area in the cafeteria?

	Since over half of the company's work space is now designated no
smoking,  those smokers that are concientious and actually making an effort
to be considerate, will put off their need til lunch, and take advantage of
said designated smoking area in the cafeteria, moving smoke that would have
been distributed throughout two buildings into one concentrated space (where
people are trying to eat).  The smoke can't be forced to stay in the designated 
area.  From the point of view of non-smokers who also eat (that includes most,
I believe), is this better?

Lastly, 
	I do not dispute the necessity for a formal policy regarding smoking.
It has become quite apparent over the last several days.  I am, however,
thoroughly disappointed that we cannot be adults and come to mutually
acceptable agreements without having our corporate mommies settle the
fighting.  "He was trying to kill me" and "That's cuz he was smoking in
my space" are both inappropriate positions to hold, let alone defend. 
Wherever there are children, though, there will be Peacemakers.

	Actually, these are two sides of the same coin.  It is difficult
to formalize a reasonable settlement between two parties in dispute, and
set them down into rules that are equitable regardless of point-of-view
and personal values.  Ask anyone who's gone through divorce, or even
considered it!  Everyone loses.  It becomes necessary to legislate rights
when, and only when, rights are not respected without the laws and policies
that are otherwise put in force.  The first time some atrocity is committed,
there are no applicable laws; they are enacted to avoid/punish subsequent
offenses.  However, if we would respect the rights of others, there wouldn't
be a need for these things.  Or the other side of that coin: if THEY would
respect OUR rights, WE wouldn't have to legislate against THEM.  Doesn't anyone
see the WE are THEY and vice versa?

	As always, complaints to this address.  I, at least, will make peace
with those who have a different opinion than myself.

Date Issued: May 26, 1978
	     Even though the policy is being announced today, the 
             verbal policy has been in effect for over ten years.

Purpose:     To keep coffee-stimulant available at all times of need.

Policy:      Any person who drinks coffee, will be required to make a
             new pot of coffee if that person takes the last cup.

Enforcement: Any employee found not complying with this policy will
             be sentenced to clean hardened sludge from coffee pots
	     for a period not to exceed one month and will also
	     be subjected to working in Mechanical under the direction
	     of "Captain Windex" until the employee achieves a whole
             new attitude.

Subj:	YANA - Yet Another New Assembler


Yet another new assembler.

	I have received the latest and greatest (their words!)
assembler from Intermetrics.

	They say there are no bugs in this version!!

If you would like to use it you must do the following in your login.com:

$ @gawd$sysdevice:[c68r5v0]cdefs.com ! setup new interc stuff


Then to use the old assembler use:
$ asm68

To use the new assembler use:

$ asm68000
or
$ asm68010
or
$ asm68020

Which ever one better fits the processor you are using.

If you try out this new assembler please report any bugs to me, thanks.

Following is the online docs for the assembler:

1 ASM68

  Assemble a 68000 (68010, 68020, 68881) program with the 
  InterTools Cross Assembler.

        ASM6800  prog.68k [options]
        ASM68010 prog.68k [options]
        ASM68020 prog.68k [options]
  
  Output is a file of object text (prog.ol) and optional listing files.

2 Listing_options

  Fifteen switches control the listings generated by the 
  assembler.

3 /A

  Generate source listing and show included source.

3 /G

  Generate global symbol table listing.

3 /L[=lfn]

  Specify the name of the listing file.
  The /L[=lfn] switch causes the listing to be written to file `lfn`.
  If lfn is omitted, write to source_file.lis.

3 /NOI

  Suppress listing of conditional assembly directives.

3 /NOMC

  Suppress listing of macro invocations.

3 /NOMD

  Suppress listing of macro definitions.

3 /MA

  Show all macro expansions.

3 /MG

  Show expansion of macro lines that generate object code.

3 /PG[=lines]

  Set lines-per-page to lines.  If lines is omitted, suppress pagination.

3 /PS

  Show code generated for structured syntax.

3 /SO

  Generate source listing.

3 /SYM

  Generate symbol table listing.

3 /TR

  Trim comments from listing.

3 /UNL

  Show unassembled source.

3 /X
 
  Generate cross-reference listing on source_file.lis.

2 Include_Options

  Use these options to specify the directories in which 
  the assembler will look for include files.

3 /I=(dir1[,dir2,...])

  Define user include directory(ies).  Up to 32 permitted.

3 /MI=mfn

  Pre-include file mfn into source stream.

3 /SY=(dir1[,dir2,...])

  Define system include directory(ies).  Up to 32 permitted.

2 Code_Generation_Options

  These switches are used to force PC-relative addressing or
  to specify the offset size of branches.  These options
  mimic the assembler OPT directives.

3 /ABS

  Force absolute addressing.

3 /BRS

  Use 8-bit addressing for forward (undefined) branches.

3 /BRW

  Use 16-bit addressing for forward (undefined) branches.

3 /FRS

  Use short addressing for forward (undefined) references.

3 /PCO

  Force PC-relative addressing in absolute section.

3 /PCS

  Force PC-relative addressing in relocatable section.

2 Misc_Options

3 /DE

  Generate symbolic debugging information.  The default is no symbolic
  debugging information.  Symbol information can be displayed with
  the SYMLIST symbol list utility, and can be be read by the XDB
  symbolic debugger.

3 /E[=efn]

  Write all error messages to efn.  If efn is omitted, 
  suppress all messages.

3 /FO

  Fold all identifiers to upper case.

3 /O=ofn

  Write object module to file ofn.

3 /W[=n]

  Suppress warning messages of severity less than or
  equal to 'n' (default 10).  

3 /V

  The /V switch causes the compiler to display a verification message
  at each phase of the compiler.

Subj:	Intermetrics tools


In response to Jim's previous mail message(s), I think you should be using
one of the following logical names instead of GAWD$SYSDEVICE:[bla_bla]:

	$ @IM_OLDTOOLS:[COM]CDEFS	!to use the previous version of
					! the InterMetrics tools
	$ @IM_TOOLS:[COM]CDEFS		!to use the current version
	$ @IM_NEWTOOLS:[COM]CDEFS	!to use the newest version

What will happen is IM_NEWTOOLS will always be set to point to the newest
release of the Intermetrics tools. After sufficient testing of the tools,
IM_TOOLS will be set to point to that version and IM_OLDTOOLS will be set to
point to the previous version. You will be notified of any or all of these
changes, and they are unlikely to occur more often than the lifetime of a game
project. As an example, the current assignments are:

	IM_OLDTOOLS points to version 3.1
	IM_TOOLS    points to version 3.1
	IM_NEWTOOLS points to version 5.0

If version 5 is accepted, the names will be changed to:

	IM_OLDTOOLS will point to version 3.1
	IM_TOOLS    will point to version 5.0
	IM_NEWTOOLS will point to version 5.0

I recommend you NOT use physical device names (such as gawd$sysdevice) since
they are subject to change.

Subj:	U say U cain't spel? Me either...


This is for EDT and TPU users; WMC users will not find this utility of
any value.

During the printer room shuffle I found a program that I believe was left
behind by the consumer group. It's a spelling checker/corrector from DEC.
I installed it on all the systems today. It seems to be kind of neat. It's
a lot better than Webster and the Unix spelling checkers. The only pain
might be the editor. It only allows you to edit one line of text. To use
it type:

	$ SPELL/KEY=EDT filename

I think you'll want the /KEY=EDT otherwise it defaults to a WPS keypad
for editing and it's anybody's guess what that is. The first time it
runs, it'll ask if you want a personal dictionary created (defaults to
yes). I recommend it. It then displays your file in a window with the
questioned words highlighted. The word highlighted the brightest is the
one it is currently asking about. In the lower window it displays a list
of words that it thinks you meant (if any). Use the left/right arrow
keys to select the correct word and type return to select it. All the
words in the file matching the questioned word will be corrected (if
the global replace option is in effect). You may also use the up/down
arrow to switch to the other options line and either type the first
letter of the command and return or use the arrow keys and return to
select the option. 

Your personal dictionary is an ASCII file located in your home directory
(SYS$LOGIN:PERSONAL.LGP) and you can edit it and add words of your
choosing. You may also have multiple dictionaries or none. The command 
line options:

	/NOPERSONAL		!selects no personal dictionary
	/PERSONAL=file		!selects file other that PERSONAL.LGP
	/DICT=(file[,...]) 	!selects multiple dictionaries
	/OUTPUT=file		!gives a new name to output file
				! the default is the same name as the input
	/NOOUTPUT		!if you don't want an output file.
				! you can still add words to your
				!  personal dictionary though

The only syntax requirement for dictionary files is that there be spaces
or new-lines separating the words in the file. Words may appear in any order.

	New phone lists are now available from my office, they are
 dated 15-SEP-1988.  There have been a lot of changes and additions
 in the past month so I suggest you make the effort to get one.
	Also the format has changed slightly, it is now two sided
 with Atari Games phone list on one side and Tengen, AOI, and
 Offsite numbers on the back.  This was forced by our recent
 expansion but has the added benefit of allowing me to include
 miscellaneous numbers such as the credit union, etc.
	As always fone or find functions still work.
	Finally, let me take the opportunity to thank Jeff Bell
 without whom the list would not exist in the formats available
 now.  However, he does not maintain the list, so give all
 changes, additions, and deletions to me via OHARA, x3746 or
 leave a message with Steph.
				thank you,

Subj:	The new color plotter


I finally got the damn device driver and print symbiont working for the
color printer. I can't recommend writing VMS device drivers and symbionts
as a recreational activity.

Anyhow, it's quite simple to use. You might want to define a word to
short cut it even further:

	$ PRINT/QUE=TEK filename.type

The system will assume a .LIS filetype (sorry, can't make it not do that) and
Dave Theurer's TEK writer program(s) create files with null filetypes so you
will typically have to suffix a period (.) to your filename. 

The only qualifiers on the print command that do anything are the
/QUE and /NOTIFY. All the others (such as /HEAD/FLAG/BURST etc)
are accepted but ignored.

If you use /NOTIFY, the system will beep your terminal when it has finished
sending the file to the printer but before the printer has imaged and 
printed your picture (it'll probably be done doing those by the
time you get to the printer room). If there's an error either in the file
or with the transfer of the file to the printer or with the printer itself
you will be notified ONLY if you use the /NOTIFY switch on the PRINT
command. If you don't use /NOTIFY and there is an error, the system will
not tell you and it will simply toss your picture into the bit bucket.
I recommend you always use /NOTIFY.

There are 3 errors that may be reported:

1)	%SYSTEM-F-DEVOFFLINE, Device not available...

which means the printer is not plugged in and/or turned on.

2)	%RMS-F-ILLREC, Illegal record type

which means the file preamble is incorrect. See Dave Theurer if you get
this error. The Tektronix printer requires a specially formatted file
with several thousand bytes of information about how to format the picture,
how the colors are defined etc. You can only print files that have been
correctly formatted. If there is an error in the format, the system
will return this error.

3)	%SYSTEM-F-DEVCMDERR, Device command error

which means the printer generated a fault condition. This may be due to
bad data in the file, various timeouts or the printer ran out of paper
or ribbon.

There may be a bunch of other errors generated by the job controller,
symbiont routines, run time library and others that just haven't popped 
up yet. If you get any of these, let me know.

Now a word about the printer. The Tektronix printer appeared to be the
best of all the color printers that were available within a $10k
budget. It still appears that way, however, it does require some TLC.
I believe you may need to clean the heads after printing around a dozen
pages or so. The cleaning procedure is very easy, not the least bit
messy, takes only about 30 seconds and can make all the difference in
the world on the clarity of your print. If your picture appears a little
fuzzy or has blotches in it, then the heads need cleaning. Come see me
if you want to learn how to clean it. We haven't measured it yet, but
have been told that it costs about 35 cents to print a picture. So please
be reasonable about how many pictures you print.

input.  So this is your chance to be creative or at least cast a vote for 
your favorite name.

(Now, Ms. Mott, we know that as a former computer systems specialist 
you may have ways to stuff the ballot box in favor of your name choice,
but we'll trust you to try and remain impartial.)

The following is a list of names that have been suggested for the Moncrief
group's driving simulator game.  Take a few moments of creative energy
and try to add new alternatives to this list or just vote for your favorite.

Subj:	Symbols? We don't need no stinking symbols...


I just released v2.6 of LLF. There are a few minor modifications to the
source code to correct compile time problems for C68k and Xenix. These
changes were mostly confined inside conditionals, but some were not.

The one other change was the addition of an feature to exclude symbols
from the output file. To use this feature, you'll need an option file.
Stick the word NOSYMBOL (can be abbreviated) between the FILE or
LIBRARY command and the open paren. For example:

	FILE NOSYM ( fred )

will exclude symbols defined in fred from the output file. If you use
this on a LIBRARY command, then all symbols defined by all the files
extracted from the library will be excluded from the output file. If, on
the command line, you don't specify a /SYM or do specify a /REL, then
the NOSYMBOL option is ignored.

Subj:	SCOM IC Class


As you may know most of our games use the SCOM serial communications chip
as the interface between the main game PCB and the SA or SAC audio PCB's.
We are going to have a class on SCOM. The goal is to give you what you need to:
  1) comfortably design SCOM into your design. 
  2) write  your own SCOM driver and talk to a SA or SAC audio PCB.
  3) use the existing utility software package and its SA/SAC audio PCB handler.
Gary Stempler will describe SCOM internal operation, interfacing, and operating
characteristics. Rusty Dawe will describe how the RPM sound driver program on
the SA/SAC PCB uses the SCOM chip including error handling and do's and do'nts
for the programmer. Mike Albuagh will describe how the Utility Software code
handles sound-related calls and how it interfaces with RPM on the sound PCB. 
	MEETING: SCOM CLASS
	WHEN:    FRIDAY, 9/30/88 @ 11:00 AM

Wow!  There are too many of you to thank individually, so...

Thanks to all of you who responded and especially to those who added
to the list of alternative names for Hard Drivin'.  

I will be compiling a complete list of all suggestions and will review 
them all with the engineering team and the marketing/sales group this
week.  Just FYI, there were many votes to keep Hard Drivin' and, as for
new suggestions, Crash N' Burn and Stunt Racer seem to be the most
popular.

Subj:	growth motion objects


GROWTH MOTION OBJECT HARDWARE REQUESTS
Engineering Conference Room
Thursday, October 6, 1988  at 2 PM

Many people have expressed their interest in using the new growth motion
object hardware.  At this time, Quest is the only implementation of that
hardware.  

The Quest hardware has a horizontally scrolling playfield of 64x30 stamps
that is visible in a 32x30 window on the left hand edge of the screen.  On the
right hand edge of the screen is a 10x30 strip of alphanumerics.  Each scan
line of the scrolling playfield has its own HSCROLL value.  Both playfield and
alpha pictures have one word specifiers.

Overlayed above the playfield, are the growth motion objects.  The interface
to the programmer is very similar to that used in other hardwares except that 2
new parameters (MOSIZE and MOPRI) have been added to specify the size and video
priority of each object.  These motion objects are built up in two 8-bit deep 
frame buffer that can be swapped every 1, 2, or 3 frames.  Each frame, about
1 1/2 screens of motion objects can be drawn in the frame buffers. 

Quest will soon start PCB layout, so if anyone has requests or ideas about 
additions or features to add to the current board, please attend the meeting 
at the time and place given above.  Since technician and engineering time is
at a premium now, if your suggestions or ideas are not heard from at this time, 
it may significantly delay when these new features were available on a working
hardware.

					Thank You,
					Doug Snyder

Subj:	Hardware meeting notes.


	Notes from Hardware meeting on 9/28/88

Attendees : Albaugh, Arvidson, Downend, Hoff, Ly, Mc Carthy, Mc Namara, 
		Meyette, Moncrief, Moore, Ray, Snyder, Stempler. 

The original of this document will reside (for a few months) at 
	KIM$USERDISK:[MCCARTHY.HARDWARE]hdw92888.mtg

Summary of discussions:
. Glenn Mc Namara was welcomed as a new Tech. Assoc. for Johns team.
  Mike Huy Nguyen is a new engineer working on system 3-D with Morgan et al.
A new engineer (Ted ???) will be starting in a couple of weeks in Johns 
team. We still have two open requisitions for techs or tech associates, 
one each for Chris's and Rich's team.

. Components:
  Rick Meyette and Erwin Arvidson gave an account of what is happening with
the deactivation of some of the older components. Thanks, guys, for coming
by. If you need to re-activate a component call components, or give them a 
CER. 
  
RAM IC availability is still a problem. Current pricing for static RAMs is 
about $3.60 - $6.00 for 8Kx8 (depending on how soon you want them and what 
speed you need) and around $12 for 32Kx8. Erwin was asked to source 32Kx8 
parts as they will be used on ESCAPE...
VRAMs and DRAMs are major problems for those using them.

If anyone can summarize either the current V/DRAM or Static RAM situation 
with pricing information, please VAXMAIL it to me or sys$mail:hardware.

Rich Moncrief expressed concern at the lack of central information about 
components and component costs using either AVL or DATATRIEVE. Rick 
Meyette suggested that the TR card program that they are working on may 
help that situation.

. Planning.
  The rest of the meeting was devoted to long term planning and discussion 
of hardware issues. 
Most people expressed a general lack of strategic planning, coordination, 
direction, communication, and/or goals. Rich, Chris and John indicated 
that in finding a solution to these problems they had no desire to 
dictate, but would rather let the Engineers define the direction to go.

They suggested four main areas that could be defined as long term goals.
These were : 
    Common hardware chip set
    Standardization
    Cost reduction
    New design innovation
Analysis of Competitor products was added by Rick Moncrief as a 
valuable exercise.

John Ray suggested a coordinated monthly meeting as a valuable
communications exercise. Rick Moncrief suggests that as a group we have the
talent to do the best, lowest cost hardware of any of our competitors, then
asks what will we have a year from now. 

A strategic planning session was set up for 10.00am on Thursday, with Rich 
Moore, John Ray, Chris Downend, Pat Mc Carthy, Gary Stempler, Doug Snyder
and Rick Moncrief attending. Lyle Rains joined in the discussion towards 
the end. Some notes from this meeting :

It was stated that the current target is for 8-10 new game start-ups in the 
coming year. The existing hardwares were stated as : Driver, 3-D, 
Romalot, Qdeck/War, Cyberball, Tetris, Growth-Motion, though Romalot, 
Qdeck/War, Cyberball and Tetris were closely related to each other.

. Chip-set / cost-reduction / standardization.
  A Common hardware chip set leads to both Standardization and Cost
reduction. The STAMP chip set was stated as the basis of a high quality
$100 stamp type hardware. The VAD chip is expected to save $10, the Shifter
chip $5-$8 depending on what extra hardware features were required. Doug
expressed interest in a doing a Priority Chip with many applications.
Continued use of stamp type hardware for a significant portion of our
products is expected. This makes a cost effective stamp chip set a very
desirable asset. 

. Innovation.
  New design innovation was required to provide growth opportunity. Current 
or new innovative hardware ideas are:
    Driver (Moncrief et al).
    System 3-D (Hoff et al).
    Growth Motion (Snyder).
    Growth and rotate (new suggestion). Ala Assault.
    Bit Map (new suggestion). Possible a TMS34010 and a TWIG, or some 
				    other low cost bit map system.

Some new innovative hardwares should be developed in advance before a game
project and programmer is assigned. Doug demonstrated the value of this
with his Growth Motion Object hardware. 


. Analysis of Competitor products:
  Doug, Gary and Rick agreed to cost out some of our competitors hardwares.
The general feeling was that our competitors have no significant
electronics cost advantage over us for equally capable hardwares. The main
difference between competitor games and our games was the quantity of
memory, (program and graphics). We appear to use twice as much memory. 


. Support:
  The main requirements for support at the moment are in AUDIO hardware and 
an ASAP development system.

The S.A. Audio board did the job it was required to do i.e. separate Audio
technical advances from Project schedules and provide a common standard
audio configuration. The SAC audio board on the other hand is far to
expensive for what it does. Until someone can come up with a more effective
way to do what we want in terms of generating audio there will probably be
little on no hardware effort put into audio. We can try to cost reduce both
the S.A. board and the SAC board but that is not the most effective use of
a Hardware engineers time at the moment. Rick suggested that the ELSIE chip
may be a solution. That is an Analog devices 2100 DSP packaged with RAM,
ROM, TIMER and Serial port all in one chip, available sometime nest year.
Doug suggested that the ASAP chip may also provide a solution. 

Lyle suggested that an ASAP development system was a high priority as no 
development on the ASAP chip (expected early next year) could be done 
until one was available. Doug, Pat and Gary agreed to get together soon to 
work out some of the fundamental issues. 

Current plans expressed by the engineers are :-
Pat : 	Incorporate MOB into Romalot, (MOBALOT)
	Design the VAD chip,
	Work on ASAP development system.

Doug : 	Continue development on Growth Motion object
	Convert Growth MO hardware to use ASAP when available
	Work on ASAP development system.

Gary :	Continue War/Qdeck
	Possibly look at a new Growth/Rotation method.
	Work on ASAP development system.


Thank you for reading this far.
Comments and discussion on all of the above are welcomed.

Subj:	RAD file manipulations


[theurer.pps]radmod.doc : Description of radmod program. (10/10/88)

There's a new program that does those things to rad files that you've always
wanted to do.

RAD file operations:
> double or halve each cell in H or V direction
> flip each cell around H or V axis
> rotate each cell 90,180,270 or n degrees
> scale each cell specified percentage in H and V directions

RAD file analysis:
> display pixel values in hex on the screen
> tabulate palette usage for each cell & put results in a list file.
> tabulate pixel usage for each cell & put results in a list file.

To execute program:
$ run [theurer.pps]radmod
and answer all the questions

Notes:
> No picture information is lost when cells are rotated or scaled.  The cell
  is automatically made bigger to hold the picture if necessary.  If the
  cells are changed in size, then they will probably be rearranged on the
  rad page.
> This is a new program and may have a bug or two.  So if you use it and it
  does something weird, please save the file & write down what you did.
> It does the operation specified to ALL the cells in the file.
> It creates a new file with only the cell and palette information from the
  original file.  It doesn't copy any funny stuff you might have on your
  pages that's not in a cell. And it doesn't copy over animation parameters.
> It's fast.
> If you want it to do more, lemme know.

Subj:	Color printer probs.

There appears to be a bug in the color printer device driver for the VAX.
It will crash the system (BERT) sometimes for some reason, especially if
more than 1 file is qued up. I suspect it is due to the driver spending
too much time in kernel mode at an elevated priority which may be causing
some ethernet traffic data overruns.

So until I can figure out how to fix it, I've put a band-aid on it by
forcing a time delay of 4 minutes between prints. It seems to take nearly
that long to make a print anyway, so you may not notice a difference
except your terminal won't be beeped until the timeout has lapsed.

Subj:	IKOS simulation accelerator


The IKOS simulatom accelerator arrived Oct 3. has been installed and, to the
best of my knowledge, is working. The unit is a general purpose digital
simulation accelerator which, if one has or makes the conversion libraries, can
work with gate array and standard cell libraries from VTI, LSI Logic, Fujitsu,
Gould/AMI, National Semiconductor, Mitsubishi, NCR, NEC, OKI, Toshiba, Texas
Instruments, 	Thomson-Mostek, Intel ...     It expects a Futurenet net list. 
We have software from IKOS to convert VTI .fns and .hns to this format and we
have the IKOS software to use these VTI libraries:  VSC100, VGT100. 

	Use with other libraries requires that one buy or build the files 
required to describe the timing and interconnect of the target library.  

Dave, Sam and I took a 2 day introductory course at IKOS on Oct. 10,11 
and now know how to get started.
	
	The unit is in the CAD lab just off the System 3D lab area.  
Expected first use will be Sam determining the vector coverage of the GOBOT 
test.  Second use is expected to be by Dave on the Clippy chip or on the 
diagnosis of the Zippy.

Subj:	Atari Games launches new subsidiary--Tengen Japan


Atari Games Corporation has formed a new subsidiary company called 
Tengen Japan which will design and develop consumer entertainment
software for home game and computer systems as well as coin-operated
video games.  The company is an extension of the U. S. based software
company, Tengen Inc., which was established in December of 1987 and 
currently is developing and marketing video games for the Nintendo
Entertainment System.

Tengen Japan will be based in Tokyo and headed by Kazuo Matsunaga,
President, who has a broad base of experience in research and 
development for entertainment products, as he most recently was
responsible for the engineering R&D efforts at Namco Limited.  Tengen
Japan is located in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo.

Tengen Inc. and Tengen Japan are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Atari
Games Corporation, a California-based company that prioneered the
video game industry.  Since its inception in 1972, Atari Games has
produced over 150 video games and currently has the largest R&D staff
in the United States.

                                 J.Ray 10/24/88

         Attendees: Chris Downend, Tim Hubberstey, Pat McCarthy,
              Rick Moncrief, Rich Moore, John Ray, Doug Snyder, Gary
              Stempler.

         Sorry for the late posting of these notes.

         Tim Hubberstey was introduced as a new hardware engineer for
         NU Team.

         It was reported that Doug, Pat, and Gary had done some
         initial planning for the ASAP development system. It is
         planned to be based upon a PC clone with one or two
         additional custom boards external to the PC.

         Gary is working on a new audio board called SAD.

         Doug determined that the priority chip will not save him any
         money in his growth motion object hardware, so he will pass
         on designing it.

         Three tasks were given to Tim:

              1. Priority chip (for MOB and other hardware systems).
                 Tim will start by getting up to speed on the MOB chip
                 set and the VTI tools.
              2. Help with ASAP development system.
                 Doug will farm out portions of the system to Tim in
                 2-4 weeks. Tim will start by getting up to speed on
                 the ASAP chip.
              3. Rotate hardware investigation.
                 Gary and Tim will both look at competitor's rotation
                 hardware and propose concepts for an Atari rotation
                 hardware.

         Please let me know of any additions or corrections.

         Thanks!!

         John

Subj:	YAPP - yet another pre-processor


I did a Macro PreProcessor for Mike to use as a front end to AS68K until
MAC68K is up and running. It is essentially MAC65 with 40% of its guts
cut out. It occurs to me that it might be useful for other things. The
first thing I thought of was to have it generate the initialiser code for
a large array of structures in one of my C modules. For example, the
C source currently looks something like this:

struct whatever name[] = {
	{ init,init,init,etc...},
	{ init,init,init,etc...},
	etc...
};

where struct whatever is a rather large structure with (in my case) 13
items. I found it rather a pain to code it up and especially a pain to
change the struct. The C macros are no help since one cannot apply
defaults, skip arguments or make any decisions about any argument.
The source code before sending it through MACPP would look like:

    .macro init opt=0,def=1,value=0,name="some_string",comma=1
    .if ne,comma
    { opt,def,value,name },
    .iif
    { opt,def,value,name }
    .endc

    struct whatever name[] = {
	    init value=100,name="this string"
	    init opt=2,def=8
	    init
	    init name="some other string"
	    init value=99,comma=0
    };

The default values (strings actually) for each item are placed on the
macro definition after an equal sign behind its cooresponding keyword.
The macro is called with arguments specified by keyword for only those
arguments that are relevant. This makes it a whole lot easier to read
and maintain.

Since MACPP was really meant for an assembly language source code, 
there'll be cases where it'll screw up on C code (such as with semicolons
in macro arguments). But you might find it useful for some things.

There's a brief documentation file in DOK:MACPP.DOC that you can
look at for more details. It'll help if you already know MAC65 
statement syntax.

Subj:	Another 3-D image projector - this one is at a local bar


Optional Field trip (costs to be borne by the employee):

WHAT: A 3-D projection in space gizmo - "you will want to reach out
		and touch them but they are not there".

WHERE: Oasis Nightclub/Bar/Disco
       400 N. First, San Jose (cross street: Julian)
       ...popular with S.J. State people or so I hear...

WHEN: This week only (?), opens about 3 PM every day, evening is best due to 
       better lighting or lack thereof.

WHY: Can we make a coin-op product out of this thing? With or without video?

DETAILS:
     Somebody called Momoda, and Momoda gave him my name and then he called me 
     so this is out of the blue...

	1) Company is Grand Mirage, 1322 White Oak Rd., Campbell, CA
	2) President is Steve Welck - (408) 377-5334
	3) They have a demo unit installed at the Oasis for a limited time
	   which makes viewing rather convenient. If we are interested Steve
	   said they could set up a unit here at Atari Games for a week or so.
	4) The product is called a "Real Image Projector". Through a
	   set of optics and a focusing mechanism, they scan a real 3-D
	   object (must be physically present) and re-project in a specified
	   space. The current display at the Oasis is called "Asteroid Storm"
	   and is made of a ping-pong balls. 
	5) Steve described an Oasis customer who came in with a real chain saw
	   as part of a halloween costume (no chain) and started it up! 
           Steve got him to take it into the "box"  and start up the chain saw.
           The other customers then could test their nerve by waving their 
	   hand through the projected chain saw.
	6) Steve says one unit is permanantly installed at the Magic
	   Castle Night Club in Hollywood in the Houdini room. If you toss a
	   quarter in a fish bowl, a skull is projected into the room and it
	   blows a party favor at you. He says it is a big hit.
	7) One product is called the model 50. It is 30" high, 30" deep, and
	   50" wide. The opening or viewing port is about 14" x 18". "An 
	   object can come out about 36 inches," according to Steve. A model
	   50 with injection molded optics costs under $1000. They have made
	   smaller units with 30 inch optics and a viewing port about
	   9" x 15" for under $500.
	8) He is sending me some literature.

At this point it seems more like a curiosity, but you never know.

Subj:	Programming PALs on the DATA I/O


Programming a PAL with correct data ?

The data I/O interface program for the PAL programmer has been modified.
When you type TYDIO filename without any extension, the program checks that 
the JEDEC file is dated later that the .PDS file. If you modify the .PDS file 
but forget to compile it, TYDIO will tell you that the .JDC or .JED file is not 
current, and then asks you to confirm that you want it downloaded.

The rules are :
TYDIO first looks for a .JDC file (includes simulation vectors), a 
.JED file (no simulation vectors) and a .PDS file (source)
The .JDC file is downloaded if :
	it exists and
	it is dated later than the .PDS and .JED files (if they exist)
else the .JED file is downloaded if :
	it exists and
	it is dated later than the .PDS and .JDC files (if they exist)
else you are notified if the .PDS file is dated after both .JED and .JDC files 
if they exist and you are asked to confirm that you want to continue.

You can bypass all this if you need to (say you want to download an earlier 
version) by including the filename extension and optional version number after 
the TYDIO command.

Report bugs to me if you please.



Also, MAKE can be used to compile PALs, and it doesn't mess with sys$print, or 
purge your directory like PAL2 does. If you are interested in the format, call 
or reply.

	There are twelve bits used to specify the facility number!  And there

Subj:	warning/danger..contains 100% politics


The decline and fall rarely happens over night. Slowly, imperceptibly, people
stop caring, stop believing in the system. First it's born cynics that see the 
cracks in the structure. It takes years of being reminded by those "in the
know" that only a fool does anything but think of his/her own self interest
before it starts becoming "obvious" to everyone.

	in our own case, the co-opting of the news media is almost complete.
the talking heads ramble on about who's surging in the polls, or who had the
best "sound bite" today. facts? that would only confuse the "issues". we see
an endless parade of experts mast******* each other and moaning about how awful
the election process has become. 

	you bored by the time it comes time to vote??? thats because you're 
supposed to be! I bet one more generation of bored, ignorant voters ought to be
enough for the puppet masters behind the likes of ronnie and george to go
public. 

	"But that mike guy is so cold and distant and bush is such a decent
family man sort of guy".  you know the bush campaign has the best ad-men 
that money can by, you really got to hand it to them if they can sell you 
georgie.


where is all this going, you ask? Well .....surprise! I'm not going to 
endorse a vote for mikey, although if i had to chose between tweedle bee
and tweedle dee, I pick dee.

	What I really want to remind you of is that there are other choices,
like the libertarian candidate, peace and freedom (remember those nuts?), etc.
I am always amazed that the same people that complain about the nonentities
dished up by the repudemic party don't want to "waste their vote" by voting
other than "2" party. If these two don't make you think third party, what will?

	Ron Paul is the libertarian candidate. (I think that's his name, but
gosh it sure is hard to remember having only heard it once in the electronic
media.) libertarians have more good ideas in two planks of their platform 
than the whole demoblican party's.  (mommy.....what's a platform?) (any guy
with two first names has gotta be a flake......)

	the only slam against the libertarians is that they may want to go to 
far in trimming the government. but I figure by the time they reach national
prominence they will tone down a bit.

	oh, and don't forget to vote all incumbents out.

	LET'S GET A LITTLE POLITICAL CHATTER GOING OUT THERE IN LEFT FIELD


			OK?


ps: i posted some articles detailing the wonderful record of the bush/reagan
years on the environment on the bulletin board outside dan's office. as you
read think about bush's latest "we can't afford to take that risk" ads.

pps: do you really want the former head of the gestapo in charge of our
banana republic in the making?

Subj:	gate array lIbrary for the IKOS                                      


Being that we have an IKOS library for VGT100 (2.0 micron gate array) and no one 
is using it or plans to use it, 

Being that Pat Mccarthy has a keen current interest in using on the IKOS
simulator the VGT200 library (1.6micron gate array) and other persons are 
likely to prefer the VGT200 to the VGT100,

I propose to swap the IKOS VGT100 that we have for the IKOS VGT200 that we 
do not have but want.  (The swap will avoid a $1000 to $5000 library charge 
from IKOS that we would incur on acquiring an additional library.)


Unless there is some significant input to the contrary, the swap will occur 
Tues morning Nov. 15.   

IMPACT:  
After that time we will no longer be able to simulate VGT100 on the IKOS.  
After that time we will           be able to simulate VGT200 on the IKOS.  
There is no impact on our ability to simulate either of these libraries 
using VSIM.



Please respond to this vaxaddress by Monday if you disaggree with this proposal.

Subj:	Wasted Time


         It seems to me that a great deal of time is being wasted
         waiting for meetings to get started. It is getting worse
         because people start showing up late because they know it is
         not going to start on time anyway.

         I suggest we break this vicious cycle by starting meetings no
         more than 5 minutes late starting Monday, 11/14.

         Hand-in-hand with this is better scheduling of length of
         meetings as well. I propose that we plan on 2 hours for game
         reviews, initiations, and other "major" meetings. I further
         propose that these meetings be held at 10:00 a.m. or 2:00
         p.m. That way, they start when people should be at work, they
         finish about lunch time, they start when people should be
         back from lunch, and they end before most people should need
         to leave work.

         One last request: If you are expected at a meeting but are
         unable to make it or will be late, please have the courtesy
         to contact the person in charge of the meeting to let him/her
         know they should not wait for you.

         Following these suggestions should help reduce stress and
         reduce wasted time.

         I would appreciate your comments on different or better ways
         to accomplish these goals.

         I would also appreciate your comments if you see flaws in my
         suggestions.

         Thanks for listening!!

         John

ATTENTION: All Software Designers interested in the QUEST (Growth Motion)
	   Hardware....(if not delete me now).

There will be a meeting on TUESDAY, NOV. 15 at 2:00pm in the ENGINEERING
CONFERENCE ROOM to discuss common software to be used on the QUEST hardware.
This is mainly for programmers who plan to use QUEST, to specify a software
"kernel" for the system.  Among other topics will be, Motion Object Driver,
Playfield Driver, OS routines, Collision and Utilities.  Please be familiar
with Rusty's animation sequence/command format, as the current Motion Object
Driver is based on this.  Please read/print [HUNT.DOC]ANIMDRIV.MEM before
attending this meeting.
						Thanks!
						Dennis

PS: This is a required meeting for all programmers starting new projects on
    the QUEST hardware -- you know who you are!

                                J. Ray 11/15/88

         Many ideas were brought up at the Brainstorming Session at
         the end of September. We all agree that we do not want these
         ideas to "slip through the cracks". After the session, I made
         a list of all of the items that I feel we needed to follow up
         on. This list is now posted outside of my office. Feel free
         to look this list over and write down any comments or
         additions you feel appropriate (or tell me).

         We have begun work on some of the items:

              Initiation Process
              Review Process
              "Carefrontation"
              "Pitch Session"
              "Walkabout Friday"tm

         Some of the initial thoughts associated with these topics are
         also posted outside of my office.

         If you feel that one of the items is not getting the priority
         it deserves, please let me know. If you have a desire to work
         on one of the topics, please let me know that as well!

Only the first 100 Driver Main Boards will use sockets for the VRAMs. 

(179272-024, 32 per board).

The VRAMs are MOS devices and therefore are static sensitive and require
proper handling.

By using sockets for the first 100 boards we will be able to more easily
take care of any initial VRAM handling problems.

Subj:	Hardware Engineer COOP applicant


	I received a resume from a design engineer interested in a
coop position at Atari next Spring (from Mid-March to Mid-September).
He espressed a strong interest in Video games, citing previous favorites
of I,Robot, Karate Champ, & Asteroids.

	He is attending Drexel University in Philadelphia which has
a well integrated coop program: coop experience is required to receive
a degree.  He has already worked at RCA back east for his first coop
assignment.  He will have what Drexel calls a "Pre-Junior" standing,
which means he has completed classes in Digital Design, Electrical
Instrumentation, Microprocessors and mini-computers, as well as others.

	I need to respond back to him on November 28 if we will have
an "opening" for him next year.  Please respond to me if YOU anticipate
having hardware designs in progress next spring thru summer which could
benefit with an additional engineer.  Since this applicant will not
have completed his degree, there will naturally be more "training"
reponsibilities than usual when working with a coop engineer.

Thanks,

         Jed--

         I do not have any desire to encroach on your responsibilities
         as Hardware Engineer for S.T.U.N. Runner (STUN). In fact, I
         realize that you are essential to the success of STUN. I know
         that you have invested a great deal of time in the hardware
         and have an interest in seeing it through to production.

         I apologize for not ensuring that you were involved in the
         recent decision to change the audio board on the prototype
         from the Hard Drivin' audio board to the SAC board. Lyle
         expressed a desire to have music in the game before the Focus
         group next Tuesday, and the Audio group felt that this would
         be the easiest way to go. I made the mistake of asking Tim to
         look into exactly how we should do this -- I should have
         asked you or at least asked Tim to ask you. I assumed that
         since this is just a temporary change and that we needed it
         done right away, you and Rick would prefer that we handle it.

         I will try to keep you involved as much as possible. I hope
         you will be somewhat tolerant though, if we don't do a
         perfect job of keeping you involved. But feel free to remind
         me that you are being left out if you notice we are
         neglecting you!

         We are currently trying to get a second system going so the
         programmers can continue working on one system while we put
         the other system in ROM in the cabinet. It appears as though
         it is a technician job, but we will let you know if we need
         your assistance. Feel free to come by and check with Glenn on
         the progress.

         The Focus Group starts Tuesday afternoon at 4:00. I hope you
         can attend!

         Thanks!!

         John

The color printer program, TEK, has been modified slightly.
The last question still asks if you want to print the picture now, but it
also informs you that it will delete the file after printing (to avoid
directory clutter and wasted disk space), AND it gives you an opportunity
to request 1,2, or 3 copies to be printed.  Remember, each copy costs
$ .40, so think cheap.

Subj:	New features


I just released new versions of MIXIT, DOWND, DOWNC, IMI and DIO. These versions
dasupport the extended Motorola S record format files (no symbols though). Since
they all use common I/O routines, the only change made to all but MIXIT was a
relink. MIXIT had another file qualifier option added (/MOTOROLA). If this
version of MIXIT breaks your program(s), you can get the old one back by
defining the following before running it: 

	$ MIX*IT :== $UTL$ARCHIVE:MIXIT 

This new feature may be significant only the the Arium users. The Arium command
you will need to use to make ROMable data files is:

     srec -e input_file output_file.mot
     [then ftp output_file.mot to the Vax]

To summarize, the file types currently accepted by MIXIT, DOWND, DOWNC, IMI and
DIO:

The first two formats can be MIXIT output or DIO or IMI upload type only. You
certainly won't get what you might expect if you feed a .ASM or .MAC file to one
of those utilities. The MIXIT commands are used as examples here, but the
file types are what are used to specify the format for all the other utilities: 

	$ MIXIT
	>OUT filename.ASM  !or filename.bla_bla/ASM  68k assem format
	>OUT filename.MAC  !or filename.bla_bla/MAC  MACxx assem format
The remaining formats can be either input or output:
     >IN/OUT filename.DLD  !or filename.bla_bla/DLD  MOStech load format
     >IN/OUT filename.HEX  !or filename.bla_bla/TEK  Extended TEKHEX format
     >IN/OUT filename.ROM  !or filename.bla_bla/ROM  Atari .ROM format
     >IN/OUT filename.LDA  !or filename.bla_bla/LDA  DEC LDA format
     >IN/OUT filename.VLDA !or filename.bla_bla/VLDA Atari VLDA format
     >IN/OUT filename.INTEL !or filename.blabla/INTEL Intel hex format
     >IN/OUT filename.MOT  !or filename.bla_bla/MOT  Motorola S record
     >IN/OUT filename.anything_else !or filename/IMAGE binary image format

the default filetype in all cases remains .VLDA.

There will be a multi-media event this Friday at 12:30 in the
Central Conference room, with a slide show, environmental audio recordings,
custom 3-D Viewmaster slides, and commentary.  Topics include:

	Global Destruction of the Rainforests
	Radio For Peace International
	Compare and Contrast San Jose CA and San Jose CR
	The Search for Signs of CIA involvement in Costa Rica
	Sloth--Animal or State of Mind? 
	
Many of the slides are by 3 of my neighbors who are world-class professional
nature photographers/biologists.  These slides are just amazing--weird and
disgusting insects, and birds and bats and toads and cats and lots of other
jungly critters.  I got permission to show them on the condition that I use the
slide show to raise money for the Monteverde Conservation League, an
organization which is working on reforestation, education, and expanding the
Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve to protect endangered species from having their
habitat converted to Burger King pasture land.  So, I'm requesting a $2 donation
per person.  ($25 will buy an acre of rain forest, so a little bit goes a long
way.  And I'll have them send Atari a nice "ownership" certificate.) 

If anyone has a Viewmaster viewer sitting in their toy box at home (or their toy
box here, for that matter), please bring it--it'll help speed up the 3-D portion
of the show.

See these critters now, before they (and we) go extinct.

                TENGEN TO MARKET FIRST INDEPENDENTLY PRODUCED
                     NINTENDO-COMPATIBLE GAME CARTRIDGES;
                 EXPECTS SALES TO MORE THAN DOUBLE NEXT YEAR

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA, December 12, 1988 -- Tengen Inc. a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Atari Games Corporation, has introduced the first independently
produced and manufactured Nintendo-compatible video game cartridges.

The company will launch its new line of vide game cartridges with three
current hit titles, including Pac-Man, Gauntlet and RBI Baseball.  The games 
will be available at Tengen's national network of authorized retail outlets
immediately.

The new cartridges provide complete compatibility with the Nintendo Enter-
tainment  System (NES).  The Tengen cartridges are manufactured in the
United States and built to the highest quality standards. 

Nintendo is the world's largest manufacturer of video game software and
hardware.  Introduced in 1986, Nintendo has gained 100 percent of the
manufacturing market for Nintendo-compatible games, more than 80 percent
of the home video game machines market, and projects 1988 U. S. sales to
exceed $1.7 billion.

The new cartridges were developed in respnse to widespread consumer demand
for Tengen titles, according to Randy Broweleit, Senior Vice President of
Operations.  "In the past, Nintendo was the only manufacturer of NES game
cartridges.  The only way to market games for the NES format was to have
Nintendo produce them.  As a result, Nintendo had total control over the
supply.

"As the popularity of video games increased," Broweleit continued, "both
retailers and consumers became frustrated by the unavailability of some
of our most popular titles, like RBI Baseball and Gauntlet.  Having
control over the manufacturing of our own products became a necessity.

"This development puts us in control of our own destiny," Broweleit said.
"Until now, we were only able to satisfy a fraction of the demand for our
products.  Controlling the manufacturing of our own cartridges will help
bring product supply more in line with actual consumer demand."

Pac-Man, Gauntlet and RBI Baseball will be complemented by four all-new
titles which will be introduced at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas on  January 7th.  These include NES-compatible versions of
Atari Games arcade hits, Super Sprint, Rolling Thunder and Vindicators.
Tetris, a unique skill game developed in the Soviet Union, will also be
introduced at WCES.  The new products will be available early next year.\

Tengen will also enter the home computer game market this winter with the
introduction of four new gams:  RBI Baseball, Blasteroids,  Road Blasteers
and Rolling Thunder.  The games will be produced in all popular home
computer formats including IBM, Apple and Commodore.

Headed by President, Hide Nakajima, Atari Games was formed in 1985 as a
result of the break-up of the old Warner Communications-owned Atari Inc.
Atari Games is a manufacturer of quality arcade games, and has extensive
research and development resources.  Over the past 17 years it has
created arcade hits such as Pong, Asteroids, Centipede, Gauntlet and
Super Sprint.

Tengen Inc. was created by Atari Games in 1987 in response to the growing
demand for home entertainment software.  Adapted directly from the most
popular Atari Games arcade games,  Tengen home products have the same 
graphic excitement and high-quality sound as the arcade versions.

During its first year, Tengen's initial produce line will general $35
million in revenues.  With the new manufacturing capabilities, Tengen
projects 1989 sales to more than double.

Tengen Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atari Games Corporation, and
is headquartered at 1901 McCarthy Boulevard, P. O. Box 360782, Milpitas,
California 95035.  Atari Games is a privately held company and is not
affiliated with Atari Corporation.

34020
-----
I have obtained the following information from Jeff Twombly of TI about the 
34020:

   Samples will probably be available in April if the first silicon works.

   Production quantities will probably be available in August/September
   if the first silicon works.

   My prediction is that early '90 is more realistic.

   Jeff's prediction for prices in early '90 is:

	34020	32 MHz	$150-$160
		40 MHz	$210-$225

	1MB VRAM	$30-$45		($66 now)

	1MB DRAM	$15-$18


   The 34020 has a 32 bit external memory bus and would therefore require
   eight VRAMs. Eight 1MB VRAMs would thus be 1M Byte VRAM which is what
   the Driver Turbo has now. 

   The 34020-40 has instruction cycle time of 100 ns verses 160 ns for the 
   34010-50 that we are currently using.

   Taking into account the 32 bit data bus and the ability of 1 MB VRAMs
   to write four pixels at a time, the maximum fill rate of the 34020-40
   would be 80 MegaPixels/sec. The other instructions would execute 66%
   faster than on the 34010-50.

   A 34020-40 and eight 1MB VRAMs would cost $450-$585 in early '90.


   Even if the costs were acceptable it would not be prudent to plan on the
   34020 being available in time for June '89 production of Stun Runner.

Subj:	color printer & RADMOD changes


12/19/88

BIG change to 
  > TEK, the color printer program 	and
  > RADMOD, the RAD file creator/modifier

They now accept several different file formats: 
  RAD
  PIF (Prehistoric Image Format)
  IFF (or ILBM) from the Amiga
  PICT, MacPaint, and TIFF from the Macintosh

Please use these conventional extensions:
  .RAD		
  .PIF		
  .IFF
  .PICT
  .MPNT
  .TIFF

Since RADMOD can now be used to convert foreign graphics files to RAD format,
I will no longer be supporting ILBM_TO_RAD and MAC_TO_RAD, the original format
conversion programs.
--------------------------------------------------------------
More changes for RADMOD users:
> Changed REMA (remap) function so user can specify the color at which to start
	remapping (for example, if the 1st 4 colors are just the way you want
	them and not to be remapped, then specify 4).
> Added ability to open multiple files of any type for merging into one
	final rad file.  You can use this to combine RAD files or Amiga files
	or whatever combination you like.  Unfortunately, the problem of 
	different palettes has not been addressed, so files you combine
	better all use the same palette.
> Added check feature when creating a cell to automatically clip a picture
	that is too big to fit on a RAD page and warn the user of this. This
	was necessary because of the new ability to import graphics from 
	formats with larger cells than RAD supports.	
> Added check feature when creating cells to avoid writing over existing
	cells. If you're about to overwrite an existing cell it will now warn
	you and ask for guidance.
> Removed DUBH,HALH,DUBV,HALV from menu (but if requested they still 
	work) because you can get the same results by using SCAL.

Note: [theurer.pps]radmod.doc contains documentation on all changes to RADMOD
	as well as a perfunctory operational description.

To: 	 CURRENT PROJECT TEAMS
From: 	 MARKETING, ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
Subject: PROPOSED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CHANGES
Date:  	 December 19, 1988

As you may already know, we would like to implement several changes to improve
our current project initiation and development process.  The purpose of this 
memo is to document the proposed changes/additions so that we can move forward
with improved communication, efficiency, and most of all, even better 
products.

Please review and comment on any additional improvements you can offer.

As a starting reference, we summarized some of the flaws in our present 
system, many of which were brought up in our recent brainstorm sessions:

   Lack of overall company direction/strategy.

   Low awareness of the market conditions, product requirements. 
   (Communication not there).

   Projects inititated prematurely in some cases.
  
   Inconsistent presentation of game proposals at initiation.

   Need for more player feedback throughout the development.
 
   Poor definition of the development process with some teams taking
   on their own approach. (e.g., how they interface with support groups).

   Teams working in isolation too much.

   Difficult to provide input that will be heard unless that individual 
   qualifies to have an opinion by playing the game frequently and being 
   involved early in development.

   Ineffective product reviews (vague objectives, too premature, and too much 
   of a dreaded event for the team).

   Difficult to evaluate product potential when field tests plagued with bugs,
   tuning needs.  Need time for more testing, distributor sampling. 

   Need more accurate forecasting methods for sales volumes.    

We believe many of these problems can be resolved by adapting the current 
development process.  Other issues can be addressed by incorporating some 
of the ideas that we mentioned throughout the brainstorming process. 

John Ray is documenting many ideas on how we can improve our overall 
effectiveness. 

Attendees:  Marketing, sales, engineering management, project teams.

Purpose:  This meeting will be held approximately every quarter to help 
engineering select a game concept or modify their current projects.

Marketing will provide information on competition, players, game design 
trends, etc.  Ideally, marketing and engineering will provide a list of 
the type of games they feel are appropriate to initiate, based on the  
market and the current projects already in development.

A summary of the meeting and a video tape will be made available. 

We all feel it would be much more productive if we break up the initiation 
process to include meetings prior to a formal initiation packet. These 
additional meetings will serve as "checkpoints" to insure that the proposed 
project is in line with current company needs and objectives.

PRODUCT STRATEGY MEETING:  

   In addition to the marketing input meetings, each team that is up for 
   a new project should have an informal discussion with marketing and 
   engineering management to review current product direction.  Any rough 
   concepts that are being considered could be discussed briefly to get 
   initial reactions from those present. 
                                 
PITCH SESSIONS: 

   Attendees:  Marketing, engineering management, project teams, and any 
   employee who wants to pitch their concept.

   Purpose: Individuals or groups will have an opportunity to describe their 
   game idea to all teams who are interested.  Marketing will screen all game 
   concepts before they are further developed for a pitch session.  A "product
   champion" from the marketing group will be assigned to provide direction 
   and support.  Pitch sessions should be videotaped for those unable to 
   attend.

   Details of the format/incentive for pitch sessions need to be worked out.  

   Tom Steiner has provided a handout on a proposed format and is working 
   on a videotape on "How to Pitch", which  will be available for reference.


CONCEPT APPROVAL MEETING:
 
   Attendees: Marketing, engineering management, project team.

   Purpose:   Once the team has selected a project idea, it should be
   "concept" approved by engineering management and marketing before going to 
   a full initiation.  In the concept approval process, it is the core game 
   play that will be critically evaluated.  Feedback is given at this early 
   stage to avoid wasted efforts in preparing for a full-blown initiation.  
   The marketability issues will also be evaluated (price point, product need,
   sales potential).  Once the idea is approved, a marketing product manager 
   will be assigned to the team and a project number will also be given.  
   If the concept is not approved, the team selects another concept and holds 
   another concept approval meeting.

   Preparation Details:  The project team should work on the concept for no 
   more than two weeks before holding the concept approval meeting.  The 
   following items should be covered: 

        Theme/game play. The basic, lowest level, moment-to-moment action. 
        What does the player  actually do?  How do the controls affect the 
	action?  How do opponents/playfield elements respond to what the 
	player is doing?
 
        Simple sketches illustrating the look of the game?

        Controller types and actions.

        Type of hardware used. Unique research or engineering tasks that would
        have to be performed (new hardware, new playfield software, marketing
        studies, etc.)

INITIATION MEETING: 

	Attendees:...  Marketing, engineering management, project team

	Purpose:  The next stage would be the initiation meeting which should 
	be a work session where specific game design issues are evaluated and 
	input is given for final direction of the project. 

	Specific items that need to be defined in the initiation packet:
 
     1.  Theme/storyline 
     2.  Game objectives/goals 
     3.  Controllers and function
     4.  Wave progression
     5.  Action flow (example of moment-to-moment action in one wave/level).
     6.  Audio requirements (use of speech, style of music)
     7.  Animation/graphic treatment, playfield description
     9.  Player Adversaries
    10.  Cabinet direction
    11.  Hardware considerations  
    12.  Cost estimates (set limits on cost, EPROM count, etc.)
    13.  Development schedule (include goals for first review)
    14.  Marketing issues/considerations 
    15.  Storyboards of various phases
    16.  Picture of sample screen if video is novel (RAD tool as an example)
    17.  Team personnel. We would also like a section to include "marketing 
         issues" which would cover the product logic (targeted 
         locations/players), critical elements of the game to maximize its 
         success, possibility for multiple product configurations, price 
	 points, timing in the marketplace, etc.  The assigned product manager
	 can provide this section of the packet after discussing with the 
	 project leader. Storyboards are a critical tool for the initiation 
	 meeting.  Rather than concentrate on a few, highly detailed, color 
	 boards, it would be more effective to have numerous quick sketches 
	 which depict the type of player interaction that can be expected.   
	 If the attendees agree that the game is well-defined and on the right
	 track, then the game is initiated.  (If there are problems that still
	 need to be addressed, then the team can make appropriate 
	 changes/additions and schedule another initiation meeting)

When and why we review games needs to be more flexible, although ideally, 
the current number is about right (4 before field test).    

If there are specific concerns raised by the team or marketing/management, 
then this should be addressed at an informal review.  If there are changes 
in the market conditions which would impact the project then a review could 
be scheduled as well.  In any case, reviews should be mutually determined by 
the project leader and the product manager, with an agreement on the goals 
for that review.  The product manager will be informally evaluating assigned
projects more frequently throughout the development process.  By doing this 
we hope to eliminate any surprises at reviews  (e.g., major problems with the 
game concept or playability heard for the first time.)

PRIOR TO REVIEWS: 

   In order to get more thorough and constructive feedback during the review 
process, the project team should have the game playable for the 24 hours 
preceding the review. This should allow everyone time to formulate comments 
and feedback.  The P/L should send out notices of the review date/time.  
A day before the review, all attendees should receive a list which documents 
the agenda items for discussion and the goals of the review.  A brief 
description of the current state of the game as well as changes since the last
review should be included so attendees understand what they should be 
evaluating.  

DURING REVIEWS: 

   Consistent review of all agenda items should be done in a structured way to
make sure it is fully discussed.  The team should critique their game first, 
discussing known strengths and weaknesses.  If the team discusses what they 
plan to do to address known weaknesses, then they can avoid hearing redundant 
negative comments. Another thought is to have the P/L and product manager 
review game play. Especifics much like we do in a focus group.  

   We should objectively revisit the goals of the project as set forth at 
initiation what are the strengths of this game and how can we capitalize 
on it.    

   Directional input and action items should be verbally summarized at the end
of the review so that all attendees have a clear understanding of the outcome.
 
POST REVIEWS:  
   
   The project leader should document the results of the review and include a 
list of all action items and subsequent changes in scheduling if impacted.  
Revision of project goals should also be specified if necessary.

   What we should avoid is amibiguity in the direction we are taking (e.g., 
concern raised about the lack of a goal in the game (we will "look into it.")

   As a rough guideline, we should continue to schedule reviews at certain 
stages of development, much like in the past:

   First review objectives typically include evaluation of the first-pass 
   look and feel of the game (rough graphics and player control) and hardware
   demonstration, if new or unique application.

   Second review objectives are to demonstrate a near-complete wave or level, 
   with concentration on the moment-to-moment action.  Player comprehension 
   is generally an issue at this stage.  The focus group schedule can be 
   discussed, depending on the confidence level of the project.  

   By the third review, a feel for the game progression should be evident 
   as multiple waves are done.  Adversary interaction, level of 
   decision-making, player goals, and measurement of performance are some of 
   the more critical elements that should be in the game

   The fourth review is usually after focus group and before a field test.
   If a focus group has been conducted, then we revisit any directional 
   changes at this review.  Game elements that need to be included for field
   test are also discussed at this review.  

   Post field test reviews vary in number and frequency, depending on what
   we learn from player reaction, game statistics, etc.

   We have relied on focus groups (30 players) and field surveys (20-40 
   players) for our external evaluation of product.  Where needed, we can 
   consider doing earlier focus testing, and perhaps more in-depth 
   interviewing of players who are recruited from field surveys.

   When necessary we can call in playtesters (either internal or external) to 
   provide additional in put in the development process. 
 
FOCUS GROUPS:  

   The purpose is to determine perceived strengths and weaknesses of a 
product, comprehension issues, and a sense of who the product may appeal to 
most.  When we have specific concerns about a product we will consider earlier
focus groups.  As an example, if controls are a major directional issue, then 
we can conduct a controller test.  Other examples include theme or unique game
format.

   In some cases, it may be appropriate to skip a focus group altogether 
depending on the confidence level of the game.  

FIELD TESTING:  

   The purpose of the field test varies in stages.  As with the entire 
development process, the time required for testing depends on what we learn at
each critical stage.  The product manager publishes a field test schedule 
which indicates the number of units required and timing for prototypes and 
pre-production units.  Specific objectives for each field test should be 
defined once discussed with the team. The objective of the first field test is
to measure initial earnings potential in a typical arcade.
 
   Player feedback is gathered from the field to again look at strengths and 
weaknesses of the game, and to profile the player base.
      
   The second field test is started once the issues from the first test are 
addressed to some extent.  This test is also intended to be a longevity test 
where earnings and the learning curve are evaluated for a period of 6-8 weeks.

   Next test units are used to measure street location potential and also to 
test various coinage options or difficulty variables.

   The fourth round of testing is to evaluate earnings/appeal out of the area.
Whenever possible, we will push to have samples available at least four weeks 
prior to finished goods for distributor testing.  These are typically 
pre-production units which ship with a tuned program, and may need to be 
updated to a production version at a later date. 

   Throughout the testing process, game tuning is an ongoing objective, as it 
is a dynamic process up through production.

   Near the conclusion of the testing process the product manager will provide
a "sales volume forecast" which will be based on the collective field test 
results to date, the current market conditions, the product price, and the 
production timing.

   We have also reinstituted the tradition of having RIP meetings for every 
project with the intent of increasing our experience base. Final product 
evaluation will be discussed, as well as how we could have improved any 
part of the development process. This meeting should be scheduled by the 
product manager and project leader, and would be most effective if it occurs 
after we have objective field feedback from production shipments.

	If you do not now, nor will you ever, use a single 6502 for your
game _and_ coin processor, just delete this now and save some time...

	Now, for you PotShot and Tetris programmers (and any others who
are into "cheap" in a big way). Norm Avellar found yet another coin bug.
It seems that if MECHS=2, the "middle-mech-multiplier" is _not_ applied
to the left mech. I can only assume this was on purpose, because the code
goes to some effort to do it. I also could swear I changed it a long time
ago. But then again, I would have guessed that the copy of nucn65 in 
sys$sysdevice:[utilities] was no more than two versions out of date too...

	Anyway, the latest (today) version of nucn65.mac is in
ee$userdisk:[albaugh.6502.coin], and will be in wherever the standard place
should be if someone will let me know where that is (I can never unravel
AUDIO's logicals). The version in sys$sysdevice:[utilities] is unbelievably
old and crufty, so it is almost certainly _not_ being used by anybody. Maybe
I ought to delete it and see who screams :-)

					Any suggestions?
