Pat,

	If you are going to design a new Sound Procesor System you
might want to consider some of the things I have done on TomCat.

   1. The TMS 5220C can be reset by bringing /WS and /RS down (and up)
at the same time. Therefore, it does not require a transistor switch 
to remove -5V from the IC. (TMS 5220C is Atari p/n 137308-002.)

   2. The TMS 5220C Clock input will accept an almost TTL level if you tie 
PROUT to +5v. (You must use a pullup resistor on the CLK input so it will go 
up to VSS.) The clock frequency must then be half what it would otherwise be, 
so that for example, 8 KHz sampling requires a 320 KHz clock. 

   3. At Earl's request I designed into it the capability of having the
software be able to select the TMS 5220C Clock frequency so it can
handle 8 KHz or 10 KHz sampling at the programmer's choice.

   4. In order to accomodate more speech memory I have put together a
Sequential Memory. The programmer writes to a location to set the
starting address. There is another location that reads the data thus
selected. Every Read increments the Sequential Memory address. I have
implemented 64K bytes of Sequential Memory (in two 26256's) in addition 
to 32K bytes of Program memory and 8K bytes of RAM. (An 8K x 8 RAM takes
up less board space than two 2k x 8's.)


The above should not be considered an endorsement of the idea of having
a separate Universal Audio PCB.

Rick, These are the questions I have about the AMI Gate Array for the
Vector Generator (Atari p/n 137179-001) and about their letter
of 4/3/86:


A. Will the new part be compatible with the old part? I mean electrically,
mechanically, pin-for-pin compatible?

B. What do we get for our money? 

For Option I: 

  1. What do they do and what do we do? 

  2. How is "J flow tooling and manufacture in 5 micron technology" different 
     from the technology used in the old part? 

  3. They indicate that they are going to scrap this part too. When?

For Option 2:

  1. What do they do and what do we do? Do I just hand them a schematic and 
     they do the rest fot $13.5K ?
 
  2. If, as I suspect, their advice to "Design complete circuit from scratch"
     means "Atari designs complete circuit from scratch" how is this to
     be accomplished? Are they going to provide us with a complete CAD system,
     at no cost to Atari, or will we have to pay for it? And how much? And
     who is going to work on my game while I am designing the Gate Array? 

  3. If Atari bears the cost for redesigning this part why in the world would
     we choose AMI, a company that has already screwed us once? (And on the
     same part.)

C. Pricing:

     The way their prices are listed, if we were to go with Option I and
buy 15K would we pay $5.50 each for 5K (the First 5K) and $5.25 each for 10K 
(The Next 10K) or would we pay $5.25 each for $15K ?

     Either they are using a nonstandard method of quoting prices or they
are using a language other than English. Perhaps they are using AMI English.

If we only sell 1,000 we don't need anybody's Gate Array.

If we sell 2,500 it is a toss-up.

If we sell 5,000, AMI's Gate Array is the most cost effective.
(Assuming they can actually deliver it.)



5/12/86	  Offer from Norcomp for Fujitsu gate array.


	A. Initiation of Program		$10,000.

	B. Schematic Conversion			included

	C. Simulation/Layout/Validation		$4,080.

	D. Prototypes and final approval	$5,450.


	E. Additional samples (max 650 pcs)	$46.

	Production:	 1K	 5K
			----	-----
	    	       $4.90	$4.60

			
Contract says that the buyer is responsible for the test vectors.



Therefore: 1K = 19,530 NRE + 4,900 = 24,430 which is $24.43 each.

	   5K = 19,530 NRE + 23,000 = 42,530 which is $8.50 each.



For oops board = $13 (approximately)

Breakeven Point:

	n * 13 = 19,530 + (n * 4.90)

	(n * 13) - (n * 4.90) = 19,530

	n * 8.10 = 19,530

	n = 2,411 pcs



Even if the oops board costs $18

Breakeven Point:

	n * 18 = 19,530 + (n * 4.90)

	(n * 18) - (n * 4.90) = 19,530

	n * 13.10 = 19,530

	n = 1,490 pcs


The AMI quote was:

	Design complete circuit from scratch in 3 micron or 2 micron
double metal gate array. We supply schematic and test vectors.
(Unfortunately they did not give a price for 1K quantity)

	Lead time: 10 weeks
	      NRE: $13.5K
       Unit Price: $3.46 (5K)

The breakeven point for a $13 oops board is

	n * 13 = 13,500 + (n * 3.46)

	(n * 13) - (n * 3.46) = 13,500

	n * 9.54 = 13,500

	n = 1415 pcs

Subj:	SUMMARY ON PC POWER SUPPLY PROPOSAL

A few days ago I solicited comments on the technical aspects
of using an IBM PC style Power supply in our games - mainly for
cost savings.

Overall, I recommend a two-prong approach from here:
	1) Leave existing designs as-is since there are too many conversion
	   problems to change now.
	2) Seriously consider this type of supply on new designs with
	   new cabinets and new electronics which could take advantage
	   of the large 12 volt supply, the built-in fan and the built-in
	   on/off switch. There is NO REMOTE SENSE which is still a problem.

I found more technical specifications in the IBM Technical Reference:
	1) output voltage	current,min.	current max
		+5	   	2.3		   15.0
		-5	     	  0		     .3
		+12         	 .4                 4.2
		-12          	  0                  .25
	2) The "power good" signal is the logical AND of the DC output-voltage
	   sense signal and the AC input voltage fail. It is TTL compatible 
	   up-level for normal operation or down-level for fault conditions.
	3) There was no information about temperature de-rating.
	4) Provides a filtered AC output (switched by on/off), 120VAC @ 1.0 A 
	   this is a non-standard connector designed for use by the IBM 
           monochrome monitor. 

Here is a summary of the feedback received:
	1) McCarthy:...sounds like big brother to ASTEC we used in Gauntlet
                       for awhile - had to put a 1AMP load on 12 volt output
		       to maintain regulation.
		    ...12 volt output is relatively useless to us; would still
		       need separate supply for audio amp. [ I believe this 
		       is meant in the context of EXISTING system designs]
		    ...we should see if ASTEC or other 3rd party in PC 
		       industry is interested in working with us.

	2)Hoff:     ... sounds like some level of investigation is warranted.
		    ...Is audio voltage/current correct?
		    ...how much would the supply save in $'s?

	3)Margolin: ...Are specs with all outputs fully loaded?
		    ...The audio could be done with a bridge amp (at extra cost)
		    ...If it doesn't have remote sense, we shouldn't use it.
		    ...How do the cost figures really compare for this supply
			versus one built to our spec, assuming we buy 25000?
 
..............................................................................

For future reference, here is our current power supply cost:
	output: 5 VDC @10 Amps 0-55 degrees cent. remote sense optional;
	       12 VDC unreg @ 2amps from transformer; 12VDC reg @ .5 A added
	          to Audio Aux PCB in later revisions to support System I.

(I find it amazing that we DOUBLE the cost of a PCB with labor and overhead...
 probably due to the high-labor content of this hand-stuffed board and a 
 overhead rate that is 6.8 times the labor content; the overhead is 9.9 times
 the labor content on the power base!?)

These numbers are "standard costs" pulled from the ASK system on mike via
MANMAN using the LI,1215 command. 
	
Final Note: I just opened the latest issue of PC Week Magazine and found 
an advertisement from 47st. Computer (Mailorder discounter) for a 135W supply 
for...$64.95 (qty. 10+)...wow, that's $.50 a watt including a fan, a case and an
on/off switch and connectors. That compares favorably with $74.72 for the
existing 15-amp power base.

Ted Michon's TMS320 System				J. Margolin  5/28/86
--------------------------

The system contains 4K x 16 of Program RAM and up to 64K words of sequential
memory in EPROM.

The 68010 seems to have direct access to the Program memory when the TMS320
Reset is low; the rest of the time the 68010 generates a TMS320 Interrupt
and data is transferred under TMS320 program control. 

Summary:
   I found two items that require attention. I do not guarantee that these
are the only such items.

1. There are two 'ALS373 fall-through latches that receive their inputs from
   the TMS320 data bus and are clocked by signal 'TPOP0'. The intent appears
   to be to allow the instruction 'OUT addr,0' to write data to this latch;
   if this is correct, 'TPOP0' is the wrong signal for this operation. It 
   would have to be 'TPOP0-' .

2. The maximum output enable time for a 27512 is 100 ns. In order for the
   circuit to operate reliably over the required temperature and voltage
   ranges I suggest that the ROMs have their Outputs permanently enabled
   and followed with 'LS244 buffers which would be gated by TPIP2- .
=============================================================================
Normal Operation:

	The TMS320 executes instructions out of the 4K x 16 RAM.

	The sequential memory is used as follows.

	To set up the counter, execute:  'OUT addr,2'	
	This takes the data from the internal RAM at location 'addr' and 
	writes it to the Sequential Memory Address Counter.		

	To read the Sequential Memory, execute:   'IN addr,2'
	This reads the data from the Sequential Memory into internal RAM 
	location 'addr' and increments the Sequential Memory Address Counter.

	(Since the Sequential Memory shares the data bus with the Program RAM,
	the RAM is disabled during 'IN addr,2' )
=============================================================================
68010 Access:

The 68010 memory access appears to be under TMS320 program control.
It is unknown which of three methods are used. 

Method 1:
Reads: 
   The 68010 supplies the address to the Interface Latch and generates a 
   TMS320 Interrupt.

   The TMS320 recognizes the Interrupt, reads the data from the Interface
   latch, determines that the operation is a READ (Because BIO has not been 
   Set), gets the data from the specified location in the internal data RAM, 
   and writes it to the Interface Output Latch.

   The 68010 reads the data from the Interface Latch.

Writes:
  
   The 68010 supplies the address to the Interface Latch, sets BIO, and 
   generates a TMS320 Interrupt.

   The TMS320 recognizes the Interrupt, reads the data from the Interface
   latch, determines that the operation is a WRITE (because BIO has been set),
   resets BIO, and waits for the 68010 to set it again.

   The 68010 writes the data to the Interface Latch and sets BIO.

   The TMS320 sees that BIO has been set, reads the Input Interface Latch, and
   writes that data to the internal data RAM.

Method 2:

   Reads and Writes are similar to Method 1, except instead of reading and
   writing to the internal data RAM, it reads and writes to the Program RAM
   (using TBLR and TBLW instructions).

Method 3:

   Similar to Method 1, except the first data is interpreted as a command 
   to indicate whether the address to follow is intended for internal
   data RAM or external Program (Table) RAM.

==============================================================================
68010 direct access to Program RAM:

   The Program RAM control signals are selected by an 'AS158 and come from 
   either the TMS320 or from the 68010.

   The Program RAM data bus is connected directly to the TMS320 data bus and 
   to an 'ALS373 which goes to the 68010. The 'ALS373 is a fall-through latch 
   which can be used as a simple buffer in this mode. By the way, because the 
   Program RAM is connected directly to the TMS320 data bus, the 68010 direct 
   access can only take place when the TMS320 is held in a Reset. (There is no
   other memory for it to access.)

   The Program RAM address bus is selected by an 'ALS157, which selects either
   the TMS320 address bus or a presumably external bus. (ABA01 - ABA12 have on
   them the symbols that appear to mean that the signals go off-board.)

=============================================================================
Other:

1. There are two 'ALS373 fall-through latches that receive their inputs from
   the TMS320 data bus and are clocked by signal 'TPOP0'. The intent appears
   to be to allow the instruction 'OUT addr,0' to write data to this latch;
   if this is correct, 'TPOP0' is the wrong signal for this operation. It 
   would have to be 'TPOP0-' .

2. Sequential memory access time:

Sequential memory access time must be: 
	TCyc - Address Valid - TIP2 Decoding - Data Setup = 

					200 - 50 - 41 - 50 = 59 ns.

Changing the 'ALS138 to an 'AS138 would increase the 59 ns figure to 70.5 ns.

The maximum output enable time for a 27512 is 100 ns. In order for the
circuit to operate reliably over the required temperature and voltage
ranges I suggest that the ROMs have their Outputs permanently enabled
and followed with 'LS244 buffers which would be gated by TPIP2- .

Sequential Memory Access Time - Counters

The worst case counter increment is two consecutine IN commands.

Memory Access = TCyc * 2 - 'ALS169 - Data Valid
	      = 400 - 16 - 50
	      = 334 ns

Therefore use at least 300 ns memory. (Most of the 27256s and all of the 
27512s that we buy are 200 ns.)

Program memory access time must be: 
	TCyc - /Men - RAM Sel. Decoding - Data Setup =

Therefore, 70 ns RAM is ok. But not by much.

Parallel Interface - System 4 Driving Simulator Project
-------------------------------------------------------

Master Controller Signals -

DB0 - DB15 	68010 Data Bus

/LNKWR		68010 decoded write strobe:
		Writes data to LS374 output latches;
		Sets appropriate Data Flags (which will generate IRQs on the 
			selected slave boards).

/TXBUFF		68010 latched control bit:
		Enables LS374 outputs to Parallel Interface Data Bus. 

/LNKSEL		68010 decoded write strobe:
		DB0: Parallel Flag 0 will be set by a /LNKWR
		DB1: Parallel Flag 1 will be set by a /LNKWR
		DB2: Parallel Flag 2 will be set by a /LNKWR
		DB3: Parallel Flag 3 will be set by a /LNKWR
		DB4: Enables the Time Out Counter which generates an IRQ if 
		        all the selected boards have not responded within the 
			required time.

/LNKRD		68010 decoded read strobe:
		Reads Parallel Interface Data Bus.


/READSTAT	68010 decoded Read:
		Reads the status of the individual flags as well as the signal
		that "All the Flags are zero".

PR0 - PR3	Signals from Slaves that reset their appropriate Flags.

==============================================================================
Master Controller Signals -

DB0 - DB15 	68010 Data Bus

/LNKWR		68010 decoded write strobe:
		Writes data to LS374 output latches;

/TXBUFF		68010 latched control bit:
		Enables LS374 outputs to Parallel Interface Data Bus. 

/LNKSEL		68010 decoded write strobe:
		DB0 - DB1: Select Slave ID 	0, 1, 2, or 3

		DB2: Enable the Interface


/LNKRD		68010 decoded read strobe:
		Reads Parallel Interface Data Bus.


/READSTAT	68010 decoded Read:
		Reads /LINKIRQ which is used as a handshaking flag for
			transmissions of blocks of data.

PR0 - PR3	When the Slave reads the data on the Parallel bus (/LNKRD), it
		resets the Flag corresponding to its Slave ID.

PF0 - PF1	The Flag that corresponds to its Slave ID generates an IRQ
		when asserted.
==============================================================================

How it works
------------

Master Sends Data to one or more Slaves.

	1. Decide which Slaves to send data to. It can be any combination.
	   Decide whether to use the Time Out Counter. If selected it will 
		generate an IRQ if all of the selected Slaves fail to respond 
		with an appropriate amount of time.
	   These decisions go into the latch controlled by /LNKSEL and remain
		in effect until changed.

	2. Use the /TXBUFF latched bit to enable the LS374 outputs. The 
		outputs	should remain enabled while sending data.

	3. Write the desired data using /LNKWR . This will also set the Flag
	   	for the selected Slave(s).

	4. Start checking 'All zero'. This will go high after all the selected
	  	Slaves have responded to the Flag. (If the Time Out Counter
		has been enabled and any Slave has not responded by the 
		appropriate time, an IRQ will be generated. The Master can 
		then check the individual Flags and find out who has not 
		responded and hopefully do something about it.)
 
	5. Repeat steps 3, 4, 5 as required.
==============================================================================
Master Receives Data: Master can only receive data from one Slave at a time

	1. Decide which Slave to receive data from. 
	   Decide whether to use the Time Out Counter. If selected it will 
		generate an IRQ if the selected Slave fails to respond 
		with an appropriate amount of time.
	   These decisions go into the latch controlled by /LNKSEL and remain
		in effect until changed.

	2. Use the /TXBUFF latched bit to enable the LS374 outputs. The 
		outputs	should remain enabled while sending data.

	3. Write the data (using /LNKWR) that tells the selected Slave that
		it is its turn to send data. This will also set the Flag
	   	for the selected Slave, generating an interrupt.

	4. Start checking 'All zero'. This will go high after the selected
	  	Slave has responded to the Flag. (If the Time Out Counter
		has been enabled and the Slave has not responded by the 
		appropriate time, an IRQ will be generated. 
 
	5. The Master will disable /TXBUFF and do a dummy /LNKWR to tell the
		Slave that it is ready to receive.

	6. The Slave sees the /LNKIRQ Flag, turns on its /TXBUFF, writes data
		to its /LNKWR, and does a dummy /LNKRD to reset the Flag.

	7. The Master sees that the Slave Flag has been reset, reads the
		Bus, and does a dummy /LNKWR to acknowledge receipt of data.

	8. This continues until the Slave has transmitted all the data it has 
		been asked to send.

	9. Master and Slave do a final handshake so the Master can tell the 
		Slave it has received the last data word.

Comments on ADSP-2100			Jed Margolin  	7/11/86
---------------------

1. I would prefer a PLCC package.

2. For a PGA package I would prefer the Inside pins to be GND and VCC
   and have the Clock input be on an outside pin.

3. For a graphics application it would be useful to have a hardware divider
   with a software selectable number of subtract cycles.

4. The applications documentation should contain discussions on:

	A. Memory configurations and access speed requirements;

	B. Interfacing the device to a host processor;

	C. Data Memory mapped I/O.

5. Analog Devices calls the socket a 100 PGA. Augat calls it a 101 PGA.
   It would be nice if everyone called it the same thing.

6. It would be nice if Analog Devices supplied a wire-wrap socket to get
   people started with their prototypes.

7. It would be nice if the ADSP-2100 had an on-chip oscillator that required
   just a crystal. Or Analog Devices could list several sources of oscillator
   modules.

8. It would be nice to have a real data sheet.

_____________________________________________________________________________

Signetics had me call Bill Mullins at Magna Sales at 727-8753.

Bill was not in but I got good service from Rebecca.

Rebecca says that Signetics expects to sample their 68010 4Q '86 and have 
production quantities 1Q '87. They promise to be competitive with Motorola 
which, according to Rebecca, is currently the sole source for 68010s.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have been paying about $15 for the 68010L8 (although we have paid
as low as $13.75 .)

From a conversation with Amy Davidson from Motorola on 7/31/86:

She gave the following 68010L8 prices to Melanie Martin:

	 2500		5K		10K
	------		-----		-----
	$23.75		$21.90		$20.35


I told her that I would be making a decision very soon on whether
to use one or two 68010s in a project I was working on (the second
one for audio) and that at $20 I doubted I would use two.

She said that Motorola would be coming out with a Plastic 68010L8
in 1Q '86 for $15 (10K quantity). 

She said something could be worked out so that if they didn't have the
plastic part by then, they would sell us the ceramic part at the
price of the plastic part.

I told her that I did not have the authority to negotiate that kind
of agreement and that I would pass it up the chain of command.


	Jed


p.s. - For a 10 MHz 68010 Motorola wants $34.50 (10K quantity), 
       For a 12 MHz part they want $99 (10K quantity).

Motorola is currently the only source on the AVL approved for the 68010L8.

Several other manufacturers make it. I am in the process of getting samples 
and a price quote from Signetics.

System 4 Image Memory: 8310.09

Questions about using the 27256 PROM Configuration Jumper, using
Shunt DIP D as an example.

1. Pin 8 (IPDSB) is left floating. Pin 9 (IPDSA) is connected to Pin 5.
   Presumably 'NC' means 'Not Connected'. Therefore the Inputs to the
   'AS139 are floating and IPOED0- will always be high so that the memory
   will never be selected.

2. Pin 4 (IAD17) is connected to Pin 10 (+) which appears to be Ted's symbol
   for +5V. Will IAD17 like being connected to +5V? [Maybe the symbol is a
   ground, which won't work, either.] 

3. Assuming I can: 
	a. Dispense with the 'AS139;
	b. Connect the Memory Output Enable permanently low;
 	c. Refrain from shorting out IAD17 (and IAA17, IAB17, and IAC17);

   Is there any reason I cannot use IAD17 (and IAA17, IAB17, and IAC17)
   to upgrade to 27512s?

Mostek seems to be for real.

The best I can make out is that their new name is Thompson Components
Mostek Division. They are owned by Thompson CSF which is a large European
Semiconductor manufacturer.

As a result of the change of ownership they have dumped some product lines
(notably Dynamic RAMs) and added others like telecommunications and
discretes from Thompson.

Our sales engineer is Dee Dee Owen (the former Dee Dee Phinney) at 970-8585.

The applications engineer is Ben Siegal at the same number.

They still make the 2Kx8 Zeropower RAM (48Z02-15). After I try out some new
samples I expect to ask you to reactivate Atari PN 137442-150 .

They make a Zeropower RAM with a Clock Calender (48T02) that could be useful 
but they don't have all the bugs out of it yet. (Maybe September)

Re: Warner Pension Fraud
Dt: 9/10/86



	I talked to Alan Wolff about the Warner Pension Fraud and he explained

that the $97,100 was not covered by the insurance because it was the 

"deductible" and that "they" had decided it was a normal (and customary?) 

business expense to be charged to the Plan.

	He estimated that Atari's share of the Plan was 5% which would come to

$4,855. According to 1984 Form 5500 Line 7a(iv) there were 186 active 

participants which would come to an average of $26.10 each. Assuming an 

average annual rate of return of 10% for the last two years, the amount by 

which Warner has defrauded each Atari employee is $31.58 .


	Jed



PS - How are they able to add Lines 7a(i) and 7a(ii) and get 186? I always 
thought that 124 + 162 = 286 .
_____________________________________________________________________________

Please reactivate:

	 137442-150	2K x 8 ZeroPower RAM	MOSTEK 	MK48Z02B-15


Once you reactivate it, I will be in a better position to talk to Mostek
about the 2k x 8 Zeropower/Timekeeper RAM.

Game Clock/Calenders
--------------------
A game that is able to keep track of the Day, Date, and Time even when the
the game is off would make several interesting features possible. 

1. A game can introduce new game elements after it is out in the field. For
example, in an adventure game a room can be locked until a certain date or
at a certain date a new opponent can appear. Or an old one can disappear.
All games of a given series can change simultaneously. 
   A. Players tend to get bored with a game after they have seen everything.
      This will give them a reason to come back to play the game again.
   B. Operators tend to permanently leave a game at its initial settings.

2. Accounting information can be more specific, especially during field test,
showing the pattern of activity by day and hour. It can also record down time.
Or excessive free plays. (This requires non-volatile RAM which we already
use.)

3. The game can also use this accounting information. If Wednesday mornings 
are usually slow, the game can give the player a little more time or an extra 
life.

4. The game can be slightly different on different days, such as having 
different backgrounds depending on the day of the week. If the game had a
moon in it, the moon could change phases appropriately.

5. The game can record the Day, Date, and Time (and initials) of high scores.
It could have the high score of the day, high score of the week, and all-time
high score.

6. The game can recognize holidays and do something special for Valentine's
Day. Or Christmas.

7. The game can remind the operator to perform scheduled maintenance (clean 
the monitor screen, tighten the controls, etc) and can log the scheduled (and 
unscheduled) maintenance and repairs. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	There are several ICs available that will perform the functions of 
Day/Date/Time. Many of them are clumsy to use. 

	The one that shows the most promise is made by Thomson Mostek. It is 
a variation of their Zeropower RAM (TM) called the Zeropower Timekeeper (TM).
The package contains a 2K x 8 RAM, Day/Date/Time Calender, Crystal, Automatic 
Power-fail Chip Deselect/Write Protection, and a Lithium Battery. It plugs 
into a standard 2K x 8 RAM socket and uses the last eight RAM locations for 
the Timekeeper. The RAM can be written to and read an unlimited number of 
times.

	A very conservative estimate of the battery life, assuming an IC 
ambient temperature of 35 degrees Celcius and assuming the game is powered up 
an average of 12 hours a day, is that fewer than 1% of the units will fail
before 6 years. Most can be expected to last at least 7.2 years. 

	Mostek expects the part to be available 4Q this year and to cost
about $18.00 in quantities of 5k. The few prototype ICs that they have
contain a bug that makes it difficult to start the Clock if it has been turned
off. They expect new prototypes later this month. 

	I have installed a Zeropower Timekeeper in a TomCat board and 
programmed it to display the Day, Date, and Time. It seems to work.

  Dear Ben,

	This is to confirm that your MK48Z02B-15 Zeropower RAM has been 
  given Atari Part Number 137442-150 and has been placed on our Approved 
  Vendor List. 

	I am interested in using it in a product that I expect to be
  produced at end of 1Q '87. Quantities are difficult to predict in the
  coin-operated games business, but I am shooting for a run of 5K minimum.

	I am also interested in your 48T02 Timekeeper RAM but will need
  production units in order for our Components Engineering Group to
  qualify it for the Approved Vendor List.


					Sincerely yours.

I have a question about Atari's 401K Plan as described in the recent handout 
entitled "WELLS FARGO BANK RETIREMENT ADVANTAGE PLANS SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION
FOR THE RETIREMENT ADVANTAGE PLAN OF ATARI GAMES CORPORATION." 

In Section 16 (HOW AND WHEN ARE BENEFITS PAID?) under the heading "Benefits
Earned Under This Plan" it states:

	"Following your termination of employment, your vested account 

balances will be distributed to you in a lump sum, in periodic payments over a

specified term, or in a combination of both methods."

My question involves the next sentence:

	"Plan assets allocable to your accounts will be valued as of the 
Valuation Date (see Question 8) coinciding with or immediately preceeding
the distribution."
  
Question 8 says that the Valuation Date is the last day of the sixth and 
twelfth months of the Plan year. I assume this means June 30 and December 31. 
(Please correct me if I am wrong.)

Therefore, according to the Plan, if I contribute $5,000 to the Plan in the 
next five months and leave before June 30, my Plan assets allocable to my
account will be valued as of December 31, 1986.

	What happens to my $5,000?

	What happens to the company contribution?

	(Who is the Plan Administrator?)	

		Jed
