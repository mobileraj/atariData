Re: Composite Negative Sync for Wells-Gardner 19K4603 and 19K4633 color 
monitors.


The Wells-Gardner 19K4603 and 19K4633 color monitors will accept only positive
sync. Testing games like DIG DUG with composite negative sync will require
either MTO'ing new monitors or replacing the interface boards in the 
4603/4633's with P317's (the one in the 4625). The horizontal centering 
control on the new board will not function with the older chasis, but that is 
the only difference. The P317 interface board costs $34.70; all inquiries
should be directed to Brenda Thompson.

Re: Speech Status
Dt: 2/11/82


	In this memo I will discuss TI's new text-to-speech system, their
coming LPC development system, and their offer to sell us vocabulary. 
Also, I will mention GI's continuing lack of interest.


	On Wednesday, February 10, I attended a demonstration at the Texas 
Instruments Regional Technology Center, where I was shown a text-to-speech 
system. The basic system consists of a TMS-7000, 2K of RAM, 10K of language 
rules, 3K of LPC Allophones, and a TMS-5220 speech synthesizer IC. The input 
consists of serial ASCII text. When the IC's are available (a few months) a 
complete set would cost about $30 in quantities of 100K. The quality was 
easily the best of the phoneme/allophone systems I have heard, but it would 
definitely not be confused with straight LPC. The only application I can think
of is where a game is called upon to speak a name or phrase entered by the 
player. For example, if the player entered his name at the beginning of the 
game, the game could speak to the player in a more personal manner.

[ Watch out, Rick, there is a torpedo behind us.] 

It could also announce the name of the person with the high score.

[ "The highest score achieved on this game was by John Smith, who scored
107,740 points, and who is a fine human being and an example to all men."]

The actual phrasing would have to have many variations so the operators won't
get sick of it and turn it off.

	TI is bringing out an LPC development system for $20K - $25K. This 
system, which they are calling "PASS" should be available in a few weeks for 
a demo at the Regional Technology Center. Mike Walack of TI said that they are
planning on making only 40 of them and that they will probably be all gone by 
the end of June. (It sounds like TI recruits used car salesmen for its staff.)

	TI has a total vocabulary of about 1500 words which they would be
willing to sell to us for about $10K. I will be getting an alphabetised list.


	GI gave me a document which was supposed to contain the information
on the algorithms used to expand the data in the vocabulary ROMs.
Several crucial pages had been omitted from the copy I received.
GI claims to be preparing a proposal for setting us up to do our own speech 
encoding.

Re: A.H.Systems Portable Motorized Antenna Mast
Dt: 2/12/82


	I called A.H.Systems and talked to Art Colin about their
Portable Motorized Antenna Mast.

	The 14 foot version (AMS-4) costs $4000 and the 22 foot 
version costs $4200. Delivery is about 3 weeks. The system is completely
portable but requires guying in other than no wind. (But the guys
can be very light.) The mast is 4 inch PVC reinforced with wood.

	They are working on a computer controlled mast as well as a
computer controlled turntable. They would controlled through an
HP-IB interface as well as a manual remote control. The antenna
mast would have a resolution of 1 cm and would have an antenna 
polarity changer. The turntable would have a resolution of 1 degree.
	
	Art expects the package to be available in 3 - 4 months and
cost $15K. People buying the antenna mast now will be able to
retrofit the computer control.

	He is sending literature.

	With this equipment, a radiated test could be completely
automated except for changing antennas.

Re: Status of Speech Synthesis
Dt: 2/22/82


	General Instrument has been unwilling or unable to supply
the support we would need to successfully use their speech synthesis
system. This situation is unfortunate since their system is in some
ways superior to TI's.

	1). During the past eight months I have repeatedly requested
the vocabulary packing algorithms used with the SP0250. Finally,
two weeks ago I received an incomplete document that was for a different
chip (the SP0256).

	2). During the past eight months I have repeatedly requested
a comprehensive proposal from GI that would enable Atari to develop speech 
vocabulary in-house. I have not received any serious proposals.

	3). I have discovered that the speech data for the SP0250 can
be manipulated on-the-fly to produced some useful effects. Words can be
whispered, or have their pitches offset, or have their pitches made monotone,
or have their speaking rate modified. I did this with a Mouse Brain
(and with no help from GI). In October, GI promised that they would modify
the program in the PIC-1650A that is used to control the SP0250 so that
it, too, could produce these special effects. The last information on the 
subject came from Bill Nowlin ( the local GI representative) who confirmed,
as per my conversation with Phil Mclaughlin (GI Group Leader) that
GI would not consider modifying the program unless Atari pays for the work.

I strongely recommend that we do NOT.


	The most promising developments have been with Texas Instruments.

	1). They expect to demonstrate a speech development system
next month. The system would cost $20K - $25K.

	2). They have an existing vocabulary of 1300 words.

	3). They expect to bring out prepackaged vocabularies in
128Kbit serial ROMS. I have vocabulary lists for them (called Time/Weather,
Military, and Avionic). They already have an Industrial vocabulary which I
have demonstrated.

The latest quote, received February 22, is as follows:

Quantity                                                  10K	25K	 100K

	TMS-5220 Speech Synthesizer 			  9.75	8.45     6.70
	TMS-61001 128Kbit serial ROM    (Industrial)	  5.10	4.60     
	TMS-61002 128Kbit serial ROM    (Time/Weather)	    "	"	
	TMS-61003 128Kbit serial ROM    (Military)	    "	"
	TMS-61004 128Kbit serial ROM    (Avionics)	    "	"
	TMS -6100 128Kbit serial ROM                      8.50  7.40      5.60

	TMS-6100 with words chosen from TI's existing vocabulary:
	     $25/word masking charge (The TI rep thinks it can be negotiated.)

I recommend that copies of the vocabulary list be distributed
and people choose 150 of the words they think would be most useful.

Re: Prices For Speech Vocabulary
Dt: 3/3/82


The latest prices from Texas Instruments for custom
vocabulary, using their speaker, are as follows:

	1 - 25 words		$140.
       25 - 50 words		$120.
       50 - 100 words		$100.
      100 - up  words		$ 90.

In addition there would be a $3000 mask charge for the
128 Kbit serial ROM. Lead time for custom serial ROMs is 12 - 16 weeks.

This compares to $25 a word, selecting from TI's existing vocabulary.
Since the last memo, I have learned that there would be
a $3000 mask charge in ADDITION to the $25 per word charge.
Lead times for serial ROMs would still be 12 - 16 weeks.

The Speech Synthesizer can also be used with external speech data
delivered by the host processor. It would require a new byte
of data every 3 ms (worst case).

A 2532 would be good for 25 seconds of speech (about 50 words).
In quantities of 25K it would cost $7.52 for a custom programmed
6100 128Kbit serial ROM (not counting vocabulary costs).

Assuming that 2532s are $5 ea. it would cost $20 for an equivalent amount of 
speech. However, since each game could have its own vocabulary ROM(s) we might
not need 128Kbits for each game. It depends how much vocabulary a game needs.

TI has offered to sell us their existing 1300 word vocabulary
for $10K. Since only about 600 appear useful, it works out to $16/word. 
Of course, if we were to put the data in 2532s anyone could copy it
and get the vocabulary without paying $10K.

TI expects to have samples of the TIME/WEATHER ROM in 2 weeks with
the MILITARY and AVIONICS ROMS becoming available in five weeks.

They expect to be able to demonstrate the PASS speech development
system around the middle of March.

Re: Speech Development System Demonstration
Dt: 3/12/82

On Tuesday, March 16, Texas Instruments will demonstrate
their "PASS" speech development system which takes audio
in and produces LPC data out (for the TMS-5220).

The demonstration will be held at 2:00 pm in the 
Downstairs Conference Room.

Re: Speech Status
Dt: 3/19/82



Summary: The method of using the Texas Instruments speech synthesizer
that is best suited for the way we develop and produce games is where
the speech data is stored in standard byte wide ROMs. Also, the most
effective way for game designers to experiment with the use of speech
in games is for Atari to purchase a PASS Speech Development System 
from Texas Instruments for $25K. If we arrange to have the PASS system here
(for two days) we can, I hope, demonstrate to management some potential
uses of speech in games.

This assumes we want to start using speech now. If we wait 10 months TI
will probably have a less expensive speech development system available
and/or other companies might have hardware and software available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Methods of Controlling the Synthesizer:

Method 1 - Vocabulary from off-the-shelf serial ROMs (150 - 205 words in each 
one)
		
						25K	100K
	
		TMS-5220 Speech Synthesizer	8.45	6.70		6.70
		TMS-61002 Industrial Vocabulary 4.60
		TMS-61003 Time/Weather		4.60
		TMS-61004 Military		4.60
		TMS-61005 Avionics		4.60
	
	Note: These serial ROMs are very easy to use from a game program with 
	      4ms interrupts.

Method 2 - Speech Synthesizer with custom serial ROM

		TMS-5220 Speech Synthesizer	8.45	6.70
		TMS-6100 128Kbit serial ROM	7.40	5.60

		The TMS-6100 would be programmed with:
			1. words from TI's existing vocabulary at a cost
			   of $16-$25 per word
			2. custom words from TI at $90 per word
			3. vocabulary developed in-house by Atari

		Note: 1. The ROMs incurr a $3K mask charge and production
			 quantities take 12-16 weeks.
		      2. very easy to use from a game program with 4ms 
		         interrupts

Method 3 - TMS-5220 Speech Synthesizer with Speech data in our own
	   byte wide ROMs. A 2532 would hold 40-50 words. Vocabulary
	   would come from TI or be developed in-house by Atari.

		Note: 1. The ROMs would be our standard ROMs in the program
			 address space.
		      2. The system is moderately easy to use from a
			 game program - however, the sample program
			 I have written for it requires attention
			 every 1.5 ms or so (although half of the time
		         it is called, the routine is guaranteed to
			 take 24 us or less).

Method 3A - Super Sound

		TMS-5220 Speech Synthesizer
		Standard ROMs
		Dedicated 6502 system to do speech, Pokey sounds,
			and all coin routines

	Note: 1. This is the most expensive method but would allow
		 the data from the synthesizer to be modified in real
		 time for special effects (I have done a sample program to
		 show these capabilities). It would also allow more
		 processing time to be devoted to Pokey sounds, and
		 would allow these sounds to be fully developed, separate
		 from the game.


Discussion:

	Method 1 is feasible only if we can work the existing ROM vocabulary
	into a game.

	Method 2 is feasible only if we can afford 16 weeks from release to 
	production.

	Methods 3 and 3A are the ones best suited for the way we develop
	and produce games.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next question is, "How can we get vocabulary?"

	1. We can buy TI's vocabulary of 1300 words for $10K.

	2. We can pay TI $90/word for custom words, using either their
	   speaker or ours.

	3. We can buy the PASS Speech Development System from TI for $25k
           and do our own vocabulary.

A caveat is in order concerning number 3.

	1. Not everyone's voice is suitable for LPC encoding
	2. The data rate without editing is about 1700 bits/sec
	   (versus 1200 for edited). We may be able to learn to
	   do our own editing.
	3. The PASS system can process about 10 secs of speech at
	   a time. The system can produce EPROMs from this or can
	   upload it through an RS-232 port. A programmer would have
	   to create the software to enable the VAX to handle the speech
	   files so a game programmer could put together an entire
	   vocabulary.
	4. The PASS system does not have the capabiliy of downloading and 
	   and playing speech, however, I already have the hardware
	   and software for doing this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we want we can have the PASS system here for two days. It would cost us 
$500 for two days ($250/day), which we could deduct from the cost of the
system if we buy one. We would also get Lisl (their resident linguist) for a 
day.

In addition we would have to agree to be responsible for the unit while we 
have it. Iraj was somewhat embarrassed about the money but explained that the 
Regional Technology Center has a separate profit and loss responsibility and 
I assume that means they want at least a small piece of the action since if 
we buy the PASS system we probably won't use their services.

Before bringing in the system (if we do), a memo should be sent to all project
leaders, engineers, programmers, technicians, and anyone else who might be 
interested, asking them to think about what a game should say, and also to 
audition prospective speakers. Two weeks' notice should be sufficient. Then we
should have a meeting.

The purpose of bringing in the PASS system would be to see if we would be able
to use it; the purpose would not be to have it here for two days and develop 
all the vocabulary we might need for a particular game.

------------------------------------------------------------

We need to start thinking about what the policy is going to be concerning
the speaker. First off, we need to find one (or two).  

Will the project teams have to find their own?

Will the speaker used during development be the same one used for the final 
version?

Will the speaker receive game bonus or will the reward be purely ego?

Do we want to use a professional speaker?

Do we want to conduct a company wide talent search?

We will eventually need to set up a quiet, acoustically dead, room.

Re: Speech Synthesis Meeting

Dt: 2 April


	There will be a meeting on Tuesday, April 13 at 2 pm in the downstairs
conference room for all of those who are interested in using speech synthesis 
in a game. Please come prepared to discuss how you propose to use it.

	Of the speech synthesis systems available, the system by Texas 
Instruments is the one best suited for the way we develop and produce games. 
They have a speech development system available (which we are thinking of 
buying) that takes audio in and generates LPC data for the synthesizer. We 
will have the speech development system here at Atari on April 20 and 21. 
TI's linguist will be here on the 20th to show us how to use the system.

Please see me if you will be coming to the meeting or if you want technical 
details on the speech synthesis system.

XY Graphics Terminal


1. Target a Market

	. Home or Commercial determines FCC class

	. What types of host computers will it be used with?

	. What types of interfaces do they have?

	. What is the target cost?

2. Define The Product (Or Product Line)

	. what are its proposed uses?

	. Design Philosophy - Do what we know how to do

	. The choice of interface is intimately connected with the 
	  definition of the product and the targeted market

	. The terminal might also be useful as a general purpose 
	  XY graphics terminal for in-house use.

3. How Will It Be Marketed?

	. Coin-Op can design it and license the design to some
	  other company

	. Coin-Op can build it and provide documentation and have another
	  company market it, support it, and provide warranty service.

	. Can Coin-Op market it and support it itself?

	. should it have the Atari name on it?

	. Will the operators object to our selling it?

	. Can the design be protected? Will we need to use custom
	  LSI for that purpose?

	. How will it be test marketed?

4. Decide who is on the project and what the responsibilities will be.

5. What about UL and FCC?
	
	. FCC Class B (home computer) would probably increase
	  development time because of certification.

Possible Product Line

1. XY Graphics Controller with Color XY Display

2. XY Graphics Controller with B/W XY Display

3. Remote Color XY Display (self-powered)

4. Remote B/W XY Monitor (self-powered)

Possible Interfaces


RS-232: 9600 Baud max which is about 1000 bits/sec

IEEE 488: typically 250 KBytes/sec
	which is 25 KBytes/100 ms update

Custom 16 bit parallel with full handshaking

PDP-11 Bus

LSI-11 Bus


*** The graphics controller will have to be shielded ***

Re: TI Speech Development System


	The Texas Instruments PASS Speech Development System does
work pretty much as advertized and could be used to generate
vocabulary for their speech synthesizer IC.

	Several people have expressed an interest in using the system 
if we buy one. They are Milt Loper (4x4), Bruce Merrit, Rich
Moore (Adventure), and Greg Rivera (Warp Speed).

	As things stand, TI is the only company that offers a speech
development system for LPC Speech Synthesis.(The other systems that are
available are for Allophone Synthesis systems like Votrax.)

Nevertheless, I do have some reservations about buying the TI PASS system:

	1. As things stand TI will not give us schematics for it
	   even though all the boards except one are standard boards.
	   This would make it difficult to fix if it broke down.

	2. The user documentation is poor. For example, it does not
	   explicitly state how to read in and execute speech data
	   from the PROM burner.

	3. More importantly, the user's manual I was shown did not
	   document the RS-232 uplink (either hardware or software).
	   This information is vital if we are to be able to upload 
	   the vocabulary data to the VAX.

	4. The unit does not always work after it is powered-up. The
	   pushbutton which is alleged to be a reset button does not 
	   perform a full system reset.

	5. It would be useful if there were a written document on
	   the rudiments of editing the LPC data.

	According to Lisl (TI's linguist) this lack of documentation 
is the result of TI Corporate policy. If this is the case perhaps
we can get one of our big cheeses to talk to one of their big cheeses.

	Despite my reservation, if we want to do our own speech development
this is the system to get.

Re: Texas Instruments
Dt: 5/3/82


   I have attached to this memo a copy of the purchase agreement that Texas 
Instruments proposes that Atari sign if we buy a PASS system.

   Iraj's reassuring cover letter is completely worthless according to the 
terms of the purchase agreement. See Section 4 LIMITED WARRANTY.

   The main points are:

   1. After the 30 day warranty period, TI is under no obligation whatsoever 
to support the system. If it breaks down we are S-O-L. I should add that it 
would probably be at least 2 months before it could be fully usable with the 
VAX system (longer, if we move to Milpitas during this period).

   2. TI will not warranty that the PASS system is even fit for our purpose, 
that of developing LPC vocabulary to be used with TI speech IC's which Atari 
is considering using.

   3. Section 6 PATENT RIGHTS seems to indicate that buying TI's speech IC's 
does not give us the right to use them without negotiating a License. ALSO, 
IT IS NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHTS TO THE VOCABULARY WE 
DEVELOP ON THE PASS.

We have several alternatives open to us:

   1. Buy the PASS system and hope for the best.

   2. Try to have Jim McNally negotiate a new agreement.

   3. Inform TI that their proposed purchase agreement is unacceptable and 
therefore Atari has decided against using TI speech IC's in its products at 
this time.


What should we do?

Re: 4x4 Schematics
Dt: 5/25/82


As per your request I have reviewed Bob Martin's schematics for 4x4. 
I have the following comments.


1. Depending on how far away the 11v is, the LM323 may need 
   a capacitor on its input.

2. The 100 ohm resistor that is connected between the +11v and
   the TDA2002 amplifiers will limit the power available to
   the speakers to 4.5 milliwatts sine wave RMS. (For two 8 ohm speakers)

3. The TDA2002 has very poor power supply rejection. Normally,
   we operate them in a bridge mode and the power supply hum cancels.
   In this circuit they are single-ended and the power supply 
   hum will appear in the speaker output.

4. The LM324 has much better power supply rejection. Whether it
   will give satisfactory results with the unregulated 11v will
   depend on how much ripple there is on the supply and on
   how well the AUDIO+5V is decoupled. (I don't see this
   decoupling circuit on the schematic).

5. Most people use at least some kind of filter after their
   Pokeys. The unfiltered square waves from the Pokeys will
   be particulary objectionable in the headphones.

6. Have you checked with the Safety Group on any safety 
   requirements relating to the use of headphones?

Re: Applied Research Project
Dt: 5/27/82


As per your request this is a proposal to set up a research
project for the purpose of investigating several areas of
game design which are currently being neglected. The goal
would be to produce a game.

The areas to be explored will include:

	Game cabinet design with an emphasis on acoustics

	Control panel design

	Graphics techniques for Color XY

	Use of speech synthesis (maybe)


By using Color XY and Warp Speed hardware we would be able
to do the project almost entirely within the department.

The project team should consist of the following:

	Project Leader - Rick Moncrief

	Engineer (and algorithms) - myself

	Programmer - Carl von Loewenfeldt

	Technician - Erik Durfey

	
	The other members of the department will be encouraged to
contribute ideas.


Scheduling - In order to know how long it will take to do something
	you have to know just what it is you are going to do. If
	you already know just what it is that you are going to do
	then you are not doing research.

	You do not wake up in the morning, look at the schedule, 
	and declare, "Today I will be brilliant".

My proposal is that things will be presented as they are developed.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Other Problems - The programmers have reserved to themselves
	the right to design games. There is no chance for anyone else
	to design a game (except for Lyle).

	The reason for my request last week to set up a Warp Speed 
	bench was so I could work out some graphics techniques that
	I am interested in investigating. In particular I want to
	do the game that I have already described as TOMCAT.
	It would be a terrific demonstration of some of the things
	that are possible with Color XY and MY hardware. I also
	believe it would be highly successful as a game.
	If this game is selected for the project and if it becomes
	a repeat of my Warp Speed experience I would be very disappointed.

Re: TI PASS Purchase Agreement
Dt: 5/28/82


I have attached a copy of TI's new proposed purchase agreement for the PASS 
system. Item 1 in my memo of 5/3/82 has been addressed. Item 2 has not. I'm 
not sure about item 3. It depends whether Iraj's cover letter constitues a 
binding modification as per Section 9 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

Since my last memo I have learned the following:

	The new Votrax chip won't be available until next year.

	National might be coming out with an LPC Speech chip
	with a development system but will not return my calls.

	Milt Loper has dropped plans for using speech in 4x4.
	Greg Rivera and Rich Moore appear to remain interested in speech.

Re: Speech Synthesis Status
Dt: 9/20/82


	The T.I. Speech Development System is in-house and appears to work

as advertised.

	Therefore, my part is done and I am ready to turn it over to whomever

is designated to receive it.

	The Speech development system can analyze up to 12 seconds of speech

at a time and when it is connected to a terminal the user can edit the speech

parameters and make EPROM's. There is also an RS-232 port for uploading speech

data (I have documentation on the protocol used). I recommend that this be

connected to the VAX and that a VAX programmer implement a system for creating

and handling Speech files. My suggestions are as follows:

	1. A typical speech ROM will contain address pointers at the beginning

	   of the ROM. Each word or phrase will have associated with it a

	   starting address of data and an ending address of data.

		a). For 6502 it might be LO,HI.

		b). For 6809 it should be HI,LO.

		c). The addresses might be local to the ROM or be absolute
		    in the address space of the game.

		d). After the look-up table comes the actual speech data.

	2. When vocabulary is added to a file it should have associated

	   with it a user supplied header consisting of 'Word', speaker, date 

	   recorded, recorded by (optional).

	3. When a user assembles a vocabulary file for a game, he/she should

	   be required only to supply a list of words. The program should

	   automatically create the address look-up table and move the

	   vocabulary data around appropriately. Then it should print a list

	   of the words and their index numbers. (Either alphabetically or by

	   index number or both.)

	4. The Speech Development System requires an RS-232 Terminal (which

	   are currently in short supply) and a room to put it in (for which

	   I have some acoustic absorbing foam). It should be a room free of

	   ventillation noise, or one where the fan can be turned off during

	   recording. Acoustic noise can significantly degrade the speech

	   quality that comes out of the system.

	5. There are ways to manipulate the speech data to produce special

	   effects. In a game with enough processing power it can be done

	   in real time. Otherwise the data can be manipulated before being

	   put into the ROM. I am willing to explain it to whoever does the

	   VAX programming.

	6. I propose sending this memo to Steve Calfee.

Re: XY Monitor Array
Dt: 9/22/82


     To maintain the aspect ratio there must be a square number of monitors.

The central part of the screen tends to have special significance so the 

minimum is 3x3=9 monitors.

     If you consider the middle row of monitors, the horizontal signal for

the middle monitor is simply the XY signal x 3.

     The signals for the other monitors are derived from offsets and 

multiplies of the original XY signal.

     Note: The monitors must all be of the type with integral pincushion

correction, or each monitor needs its own pincushion correction circuitry.

Also, If the array were used with a game board with pincushion circuitry,

the circuitry would either have to be defeated or the monitor array input

would need an anti-pincushion section.


Difficulties:

	1. The vector drawing speed is effectively 3 x original speed, so the

	   monitors must be able to handle the increased speed.

	2. When the vector passes from one display to the next, the beam must

	   be there, waiting for it. If the signals are just hard-clipped

	   at the edge of each monitor, the power dissipation will be very

	   high. This can be ameliorated somewhat by additional circuitry

	   but the dissipation will still be pretty high, especially when

	   the vector is at the intersection of four monitors.


A memo on the raster monitor array is in the works.


Another possibility is a box with a 13" color raster, a 13" color XY, a 

half silvered mirror, and a TV camera (preferably the Hitachi with the

CCD imaging element). The signal would then be shown on a projection TV

(which could still be used for other purposes).

Re: National 16000 family
Dt: 11/10/82

It looks like something I could use (instead of the 68000).

I am concerned with price and availability (especially of the 10 MHz part)
and second sources.

The software they demonstrated did appear to actually work. The symbolic 
debugger looks like it would be very useful.

They should have made more of an effort to find out what business we are
in and what processors we have used in the past. I don't particularly care 
that they have a version that executes 8080 code.

I can use either the 16032 or the 68000. It really comes down to which one
you guys want to support.

By the way, how well suited is the 16032 to doing Forth?

Re: New XY System Architecture
Dt: 11/29/82



SUMMARY: I would like to pursue a new architecture for 3D XY games. It would 
	 use two 16 bit microprocessors to replace most of the MSI now used
	 in Tomcat and would have a 6809 Auxiliary Processor for Sounds, 
	 Speech, I/O, etc., with the capability of linking two games together.

 	 The 16 bit processors would be either 68000's or 16032's (National)
	 depending upon which one the Software People will support.
	 I will need an appropriate development system for this project.

	 I would like to start the circuit design in January, have a wirewrap
	 in February, and have a demo ready during the middle of July ('83).
	 I will do the programming myself.

	 Potential uses include in a regular production game, a demo for
	 the Marriot Arcade, or as a low cost Graphics Terminal.
	 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARCHITECTURE
  
	Attached is a block diagram of a new architecture for an XY system.
It uses two 16 bit microprocessors to replace most of the MSI now used in
Tomcat.

	The first processor does the math calculations (rotations, 
translations, etc.) and the game play.

	The second processor is used as an intelligent vector generator, 
optimized for 3D projected objects. What that basically means is that the 
math processor hands to it an updated list of object points; the vector 
generator will know how they are to be connected.

	The third processor, the Auxiliary Processor, will be a 6809 and
will handle Sounds, Speech, Switches, Pots, EAROM, Coin Counters, and
Serial I/O. Because the Aux processor will be operating at a higher interrupt
rate than is feasible in existing single processor games, two games will be 
able to talk to each other and exchange enough information to do a two person
Tomcat game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS

	The 16 bit processors can be either 68000's or 16032's (from 
National). The selection will be determined by which one the Software
People decide to support. 

	In processing power, a 6 MHz 16032 seems to be about equivalent 
to a 10 MHz 68000. However, the 16032 has a clear advantage in that its
architecture makes it possible to actually know which instructions have
been executed rather than just which ones have been prefetched into the 
pipeline.

	The Graphics Terminal Project's 68000 Development system (the 
HP 64000) is not available to me under conditions that I can accept:
I could use a development station if they have one available and I would
have to relinquish it when they needed it. 

	The in-house 68000 game interface board appears to have gotten
exactly nowhere.

	National makes a development system for the 16032 which operates
in a manner similar to what we already do. The VAX is used to edit and
assemble programs; the object code is downloaded into a box out of which
comes a pod which plugs into the game's 16032 socket. A VDT plugs into
the development system for talking to the VAX and patching, running, and
debugging the program. The cost would be $16K - $20K.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEDULE

	I would like to begin the circuit design in January and be ready to
begin a wirewrap board by the beginning of February. (I would need to know 
which processor will be supported before I can do much circuit design.)

	I would need the development system by the middle of February.

	I anticipate doing the preliminary programming myself to demonstrate
the usefulness of the system. Once the development system is usable I 
would expect to take 2 weeks to debug hardware, 6 weeks to program the
Intelligent Vector Generator, 6 weeks for the Math Processor, and 6 weeks
for the Aux Processor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POTENTIAL USES

	It could be used in a regular production game, with the capability
of linking two games together. This capability has been discussed for the
last several years but has not been feasible due to the 4 ms. interrupt
rate; the amount of information transferred at a rate of 1 byte every
4 ms is not enough to link games. (The Aux Processor will operate at 1 ms
interrupts and that should do the job.)

	This architecture could be used with the powered moving seat to do
a demo for the Marriot Arcade, especially with two games linked together.

	The serial interface would make it feasible to do a low cost Graphics
Terminal

Re: Speech Recognition
Dt: 12/10/82


	There is currently no work being done by Coin-Op in the area of Speech
Recognition, although Tom Hogg has expressed an interest in it for the
Graphics Terminal Project. If we do become involved in Speech Recognition
it probably won't be with Verbex; their systems cost $65,000 ($6K-$10K for
just the boards).  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Additional material which may be of interest)


In order for a Speech Recognition System to be used successfully in a coin-
operated video game I would suggest the following requirements:

	1. Produce a 99+ % correct response which must be independent of 
	   player gender and/or dialect (assuming only American English), 
	   with no player training, and with probability of considerable 
	   noise from other games as well as the player's own game. 
	2. Cost less than $100. (and this figure is probably high).


There are currently no systems available which even come close to meeting
these requirements: 

	1. The single chip devices from Weitek and Interstate (about $10 in
	   quantity) work poorly, if at all, in the presence of noise.

	2. Even the expensive systems require that the user wear a microphone
	   headset like the ones telephone operators wear, which would not
	   be practical in an arcade video game.

	3. Matsushita supposedly has a speaker dependent system for $350 
	   which is user trainable; chip sets will probably be under $50 .

	4. Texas Instruments has done substantial work in Speech Recognition
	   (as well as synthesis) and may bring something out in '83 using
	   the TMS320 Digital Signal Processing chip. 

	5. There was a meeting on Thursday 12/9 between Weitek and 
	   representatives from various Atari Groups (hosted by the Atari
	   Semiconductor Group). Weitek has decided that it can no longer
	   afford to work on speech recognition and wants to either sell off 
	   its expertise (and several projects in varying states of 
	   development) or form some kind of joint venture to continue the
	   work. The project with the most promise (and which is 80% complete)
	   was for a speaker dependent system where the user trained the
	   system and which would probably cost less than $20 to produce.
	   
	6. General Instrument claims to be committed to Speech, and is 
	   apparently working on Speech Recognition.

 
Other products may have different requirements:

	1. The Graphics Terminal Project could probably tolerate 97% correct
	   response with user dependence. On user dependent systems there is
	   a learn mode where the user speaks the words which the machine 
	   will later recognize.

	2. For similar reasons Speech Recognition might be practical as
	   part of a Personal Computer System.

	3. If Atari goes into the telephone business, it would be interesting
	   to have a telephone with Speech Recognition instead of buttons.
	   Also, frequently called numbers could be referenced by a name
	   instead of the user having to write down and use an index number.

	4. I would like to have a VCR where I could set the Timer schedule
	   with Speech Recognition rather than funny little buttons.
