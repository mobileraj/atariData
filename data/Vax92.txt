Subj:	PREMIUM PAYMENT PLAN, MODIFIED CAFETERIA PLAN


The following is a repeat of a memo from Bob Sheffield that was included with
one of your December paychecks.  If you have read it, then delete this message
now; if not, please proceed and take advantage of this benefit if you are
eligible.

Beginning in 1992, the Company is pleased to offer a new financial benefit to
all employees who are currently paying insurance premiums through the Company's
medical and dental health plans.

Under Code 125(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, we can offer a benefit referred
to as a "cafeteria plan."  This plan covers many areas.  The management of this
Company has chosen to make this plan available to all the employees of Atari
Games beginning in 1992 on a modified basis.  If you are currently paying
medical and/or dental insurance premiums through your Company payroll check,
this new financial benefit is available beginning next month.

The Company currently pays for a large portion of your medical and dental
insurance premiums.  The Company will continue to pay these premiums.  The
portion of insurance premium that you may be paying for your spouse or for your
dependents is currently being paid by you using dollars after state and federal
income taxes have been deducted from your gross salary.

This Modified Cafeteria Plan will allow you to use monies from your gross
salary before you are taxed by the state and federal governments.  In this
case, the monies that you use to pay your insurance premiums for health care
coverage through what we call the "Premium Payment Plan" is never subject to
Federal Income Tax, FICA (Social Security) Tax, and most state income taxes.
These taxes are not merely deferred, rather, they are eliminated entirely.  The
bottom line is that you can give yourself a discount on the cost of your health
care thereby increasing your take-home pay.

The insurance premiums will be collected through a reduction of your salary.
Your salary will be reduced before any taxes are withheld, and this amount will
then be used by Atari Games to pay your required premium.

Depending on the amount of insurance premiums you pay (up to $1382) and your
federal and state tax rate (up to 40%), you have a real opportunity to increase
your take-home pay.

Since there is a potential reduction in FICA (Social Security) contributions
you may pay, there could be in rare cases where long term retirement benefits
could be impacted.  Please consult with your legal or tax advisor on this
matter.

We are very pleased about this new employee benefit and after you read the
announcement we hope you will agree and enroll in Atari's Premium Payment Plan.
Complete an enrollment form, available from the Payroll Department, and submit
to Payroll no later than January 9, 1992.

I'm selling my Honda Prelude if anyone is interested, it's a 1988 si fully
loaded (red) 5 speed with a clifford alarm system bikini bra and floormats as
extras.  I'm asking 10,500.00 or best offer.  It's in excellent condition with

Subj:	Featured feature


	Don't you just HATE to talk to rude people on the phone?  Well,
SO DO THEY.  Yes, YOU can be just as rude as the people you despise.

	Like the way this is going?  Of course not.  It's arrogant,
it talks down to you, and you feel like you know better.  Unfortunately,
sometimes we DO sound like we are above dealing with people on the phone.

	We can make this happen less often by avoiding certain trigger
phrases.  These are things "nobody likes to hear--not a spouse, not a
child, and least of all, a customer."

	I DON'T KNOW should be replaced with an offer to find out.

	WE CAN'T DO THAT should come with a sincere apology, and only
when there are no alternatives to offer.

	YOU'LL HAVE TO ... is a lie.  The caller doesn't HAVE to do
anything.  It feels much different to hear, "In order for that to happen,
we need you to ..."

	JUST A SECOND never is.  If you feel the need to excuse yourself
from the conversation, ask if the caller is willing to hold for a minute
or two.  Don't simply presume that they have nothing better to do than wait.

	NO, at the beginning of a sentence.  If you avoid saying NO as
the first word, you force yourself to project a positive image, and even if
you must deny a request, you put the caller in your camp by giving reasons
or making the caller feel like you didn't WANT to say no, even if you had to.


	These changes can't happen overnight.  It takes a while to affect
speech patterns; it takes a while just to realize you have them.  When you
hear yourself utter one of these trigger phrases, simply think of how you
could have phrased things differently...and before too long, you'll use
those speech patterns instead.

	And people will call you just to hear you talk...

Subj:	New Telephone System


To :  Atari and Tengen Employees

Atari has adquired a new telephone system and voice mail as well. This means
that in the near future, there will be a new telephone on your desk. Along
with your new telephone, you will also have your own personalized voice mail
box. The new phones operate slightly different from the current ones, however
they are much easier to operate.

The cutover for the new system has been scheduled for February 15,16,and 17.
During these three days, there will be no incoming or outgoing calls to Atari or
Tengen. We hope that the transsision goes smoothly, and if everything goes as
planned you will have your new telephones on the 18th of February. There will
be two technicians from PacTel Meridian Systems and myself to assist you with
any questions that you might have.

The new telephone system is distributed by Pactel Meridian Systems and is
manufactured by Northern Telecom. If you have any questions or concerns 
regarding this matter, I can be reached at Extention 1710.

Emmette is overloaded especially with Karen out (bad back). I expect
Karen back 1/16/92, but only at partial speed. I plan to get someone
over here from Mfg. on 1/16/92 to help out (I want Karen to be the
interface rather than bogging down Emmette with training someone).

Pat, please prioritize the task shown below for completion between now and
1/31/92 (the next 3 weeks). Let's give the (2) multi-sync IIa PCB's highest
priority since that is what Emmette is doing now.  Here is a list of work to 
do in Proto NOW:


GX2 for Moto, Space (Lee)
	- 1 board stuffed, need 16 pin sockets, then is will be wave-soldered
             on 1/13/92. (Mercieca is getting the sockets).
	-12 more PCB's in the box - HOW many more need to be stuffed by 1/31?
	    (2 for Moto, 2 for Space, xx for ??)

Multi-sync IIa (Margolin)
	- 2 boards being stuffed 1/13/92
	-23 more blanks PCB's in the box; Trainer is primary immediate need
		after the first 2 for Jed.

Warrior (Lee)
	- 15 completed PCB's in Proto - need resistor changes (about 5 per PCB).

Relief Pitcher (JMoore)
	- 3 Relief Piggyback stuffed
	- 3 more blank PCB's need to be stuffed by 1/31;
	- 3 more blank PCB's need to be stuffed by 2/15.

Space (Lee/Drobny)
	-Cables, connectors, wirewraps for the lab set-up.

P.S. Thank you to Cris Drobny for bringing to my attention.

I have a 1964 Jaguar Mark 10 for sale.

It's a four door sedan, automatic, straight

(the wrong side for us normal people), and

a bar in the back. 

	Actually it's my parents' car, but it

is for sale. It's big and it looks like a 

Rolls Royce!!  You should have seen it at 

my prom. 

	Anyway, somebody please make a bid.

It's just been restored with all kinds of stuff,

and it's now taking my space in the garage.

So the sooner I sell it...

suitable for printing.
Please respond with your ideas to JUNK MAIL

We have three suggestions you may yea or nay

Atari- a decade twice past
20 years later Atari scores a score
Still playing after all these years


all entries become the property of Atari and the judges decisions

Subj:	UNIVERSE CAD SYSTEM


In keeping with Atari Engineering's policy of Glastnost, we are 
planning two meetings to discuss the design of the Macintosh based 
Universe CAD System (for 3D polygon display systems).  

    Meeting 1: "Requirements of other projects to be considered in the design"
        When: 2:00, Wednesday, Jan 22 
        Where: Central Conference Room

    Meeting 2:  "Review of Functional Design"
        When: TBD
        Where: TBD

   The functional design concepts which serve as the basis of our
   thinking, are described in Rusty Dawe's  "Universe Cad System
   Design Document", 5/8/91.  I'll be glad to give you a copy if
   you want one.

Background:

Our product requires a large number of universes.  We believe that it would
be to our advantage to have animators help us in developing them. The 
appearance of the universes should benefit from their art backgrounds, and our 
productivity should benefit from their CAD operation skills.  It is for these
reasons that we decided to develop the Universe CAD System, and for these 
reasons that we chose the Macintosh as the platform. We want your inputs so 
that if possible, this tool, with a little bit of additional work, will work 
for you as well as for us.  I hope to see you there.

One of the Data I/O 288 EPROM programmers has 2 sockets that are flakey
mechanically. I would like to send it in for repair since we are paying for a
full service agreement on one of them. Is now a good time to send it in? I ask
that project leaders and/or lead programmers give me some feedback such as, 
"No - we need both data I/O's (even crippled) until mid-February".

FYI: The two bad sockets are now on the Data I/O in Alpha labs
and they are on sockets 7 & 8.  I moved them around to effect the least impact
on productivity and to get the bad sockets on the Data I/O chassis with the
service agreement. 

Let me know if I cuased any further problems by juggling sockets...

I went on the VAX to read mail today, and boy was I surprised.

I am the one who posted the top 15 slogans message that several people have
gotten upset about. I did not make them all up, but I posted them.

The list started out as an effort to come up with a "real" slogan
(in fact I think #3 is the best slogan I have seen so far), but degenerated
into an attempt at humor ala Dave Letterman.

I want to apologize to anyone who found the slogans tasteless or tacky. 
They were meant in the spirit of fun and were not meant to be insulting
or disrespectful to any individual or the Atari Games company.

We have to do some minor power maintenance and we have to re-arrange the
placement of some of the equipment in the computer room this saturday
(1/25/92). If I'm lucky (rarely), it will follow this schedule:

There will be no modem access the whole day.

Approximately between the hours of 9am to 11am you may find the following:

The Unix systems agc and dms will be down which means no name and
	font servers for you X terminal users!
The Terminal servers will be down which means no printer or terminal access to
	the vaxes for anyone.
The ethernet will behave goofy or won't work at all.
KIM and BERT will be down and the others will probably crash just to
annoy me.

All of this will be due to the fact that none of this equipment will be
plugged in.

Then, sometime between the hours of 11am and 1pm you may find that no
telephones anywhere in either 675 or 735 work. This will be due to the fact
that the Rolm system will be unplugged.

Subj:	20th anniversary slogan


Ten years ago we used the slogan "Atari -- the first decade".  We could go with
the logical extension of that: "Atari -- the second decade."  It's safe, but I
admit it's not very inspiring.

Another suggestion: "Serious fun begins at 20."

My favorite is "Still playing after all these years!"  I don't know how many
times I've had to explain to people that Atari DOES still exist, and we're NOT
the Tramiel company.

I think the June anniversary date should be a big media event with a press con-
ference, and with at least a half-page ad in the San Jose Mercury News announc-
ing it.  And why not an ad in the New York Times, while we're at it?  Nobody
(except game players) knows anything about us because we don't publicize to the
general public.

		     If you're tired of reading slogans and know 
		about cars I'ld be happy to hear from you.  
		
		     This question goes out to those car buffs who 
		like to work on their engine.   I think my plug wires 
		are flaking out since the cold season has hit us.   
		I remembering paying extra for a high performance 
		resistor type that came with life-time warranty.  
		I wonder whose life they're talking about anyway, 
		someone told me they're only good for 50,000 mls
		or so and I might as well change them every other yr.



	  	     Now what's the difference between a $15 set and
		a $50 one, and don't tell me $35.  They come in silicone
		7mm and 8mm and I wonder if any of this matters since
		we can't go faster than 35 mph in this valley anyway.
		
PS. If you slogan writer wanna offend anybody you're gonna have to try
    harder.

Subj:	1992 - THE YEAR OF THE BABY

 
The manufacturing department would like to congratulate
Tessi and Paul Sheppard on the arrival of their baby BOY - DANIEL.

Not only was Daniel  21" long and weighed 8 lbs/15 oz - BUT
he was born at 2:59 "IN THE MORNING" on Thursday - January 23.

Both the mother and the baby are doing great - and dad?
Well he's rapidly recovering also!

CONGRATULATIONS PAUL to you and yours!

Subj:	EPROM Programmers


1. One Data I/O (DIO) 288 is fully functional - in the cubicle.
2. One DIO 288 is flakey - bad verify on socket 2, and  2 bad sockets.
Response:
	a) I am renting (2) DIO 288's - should be here Friday (rented 1 month)
	b) I will send the DIO288 in for repair as soon as the rentals arrive.
		DIO does not have a "loaner" program - I asked.

	b) I borrowed the DIO 1020 from Mfg.; it does up to 20 devices at once.
           It shows TI27C040, Toshiba574000 and NEC274001 in its device list.
	   It does sets, but only has 1Mbyte memory or (2) 4M EPROM's.
	   It has an RS-422 serial connection. Shepperd will get it
	   talking to the VAX if we can get a tech to build the RS-422 to
	    rj-11 adapter we need to make it run from the VAX.
           In the mean time, it can be used to make copies of masters which
	   may be useful when getting many games ready at once for field tests
	   or shows, etc. 
           I must return it to Mfg. on 2/10/92 (in 2 weeks).

Subj:	CASE Expo


I am looking for 3 people to attend a CASE Expo 2/18 - 2/19 at the
Santa Clara Convention Center (with your supervisors permission).

I have doubts about the application of CASE to realtime embedded
processor software projects, but just in case (ugh) I'm missing
something, I would like to check it out.  Even the flyer on the
Expo focuses on CASE benefits for IS (information Systems) as opposed
to smaller projects (less than 6 programmers), or hardware-intensive 
software projects.

I am asking that attendees give an informal verbal recap of what they learned
at the show when they return to the office to interested parties. 

One of the special seminars is entitled, " Object-Oriented Development in C++".

CASE or computer aided software engineering employs a set of software design
tools that allow the programmer to work with large scale design functions.
In turn, the tools generate the actual code (to a greater of lesser extent
depending on the system). The simpler systems just impose a design methodology
on the programming group.

Subj:	Farewell Lunch for Will Noble


		I'll just blurt it out:
	Will Noble has decided to leave Atari. 

After nearly eight years of a tiring commute he has decided 
to make a change. Of course, anyone who has worked with him 
here will know what a loss this is to the Animation Department,
and to the many friends he made here. (Not to mention the look
of most of our games.)

So we're having a big farewell lunch Thursday, February 6 
(his last day) at the Good Earth restaurant in Santa Clara. 
Please let me know if you'd like to come so I can get a 
head count. I'll be making a map for those who haven't been 
there (it's only about ten minutes down 880). 

				Forlornly,
						Sam

Subj:	Multi-Sync II Proto Assy status.


As of 1/28/92, Emmette has delivered (11) stuffed Multi-sync PCB's to Applied
Research. He has 8 more to do. John Ray says that TRAINER needs one working
PCB and that will hold them for the next few weeks. Margolin says that he
needs one with the VRAM sockets (Erik just got the boards back from surface
mount vendor). So the plan for Emmette is:

	a) Start and complete a PCB with VRAM sockets (from Erik) by 2/3/92
	b) Set aside Partially finished board  - resume in a few weeks
	c) Set aside the 7 blank boards for a few weeks

By 2/3/92 we will have 12 completed Multi-sync II's (one w/VRAM sockets)
and 8 more to do. Proto-assy will resume stuffing Multi-sync II's the week
of 2/24. Alternatively, when Karen is back 100% and she can supervise an
assembler from Mfg. to assist in completing the PCB's, then we will start 
the PCB's sooner.

With only Emmette full-time in proto-assy, it's prudent to allocate the
resource more evenly. This will allow Emmette to complete several other tasks
pending in proto assy.

Subj:	FEAR AND LOATHING OFF ROAD


Can anybody out there in VAXland explain in not-too-technical terms the
major similarities and differences between four-wheel drive and all-wheel
drive?

Owning a Jeep Cherokee 4 X 4, I am familiar with how this car performs in
snow and mud with all-terrain tires.  This "utility vehicle" has gotten
me out of plenty of sticky situations where another car would have easily
been stuck.  And no hassle with tire chains in the snow!  It's been great, but
it's time for a change and I'm considering several different options.

References to magazine articles or other literature would also be appreciated.

Thanks!

                                               --Linda

If Eric or someone else is going to program them, I need to go over

A couple of simple (?) question for all you tech wizzards out there:

1. On an AT, is data transfer to/from the hard disk handled by DMA and are
interrupts enabled during transfer? In particular, I want to be able to service
interrupts that occur every 100us without missing any during disk transfers. 

2. Can one of the system timers be programmed to interrupt at (approximately)
a 100us rate? If so, which one?

All responses welcomed!

Dave Pasquinelli is unable to lift for a couple days and will only be
working Thursday and Friday mornings.  I need to ask your help in getting
any mail that must go out to the mail room BEFORE 3:00 today and tomorrow.

Dave will be in on Friday morning and will be able to post any mail that
can wait until Friday to go out.  Mail that must go out on Friday, must 
be in the mail room before 3:00 on Friday.

Also, each department secretary will need to stop by Dave's office Thursday

If anyone out there has a Pacific Data Products Postscript cartridge for their
HP printer, take note.  There is a bug which occurs after printing 2047 pages
in PCL mode.  The bug is that the cart stores the wrong data in the printers
NV ram making it think that it is printing on legal sized paper so the margins
will be off.  There is a temporary fix for this by manually setting the page
count on the printer to zero.  If you call Pacific Data Products, they will put
you on their list and notify you when the new version cart is available (ver 5).

I have the zeroing proceedure if anyone is interested.

CA-92:02                        CERT Advisory
   			      February 6, 1992
                         Michelangelo PC Virus Warning

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
received information concerning a personal computer virus known as
Michelangelo.  The virus affects IBM PCs and compatibles.  A description
of the virus, along with suggested countermeasures, is presented below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     The Michelangelo virus is a computer virus that affects PCs
     running MS-DOS (and PC-DOS, DR-DOS, etc.) versions 2.xx and
     higher.  Note, however, that although the virus can only execute
     on PCs running these versions of DOS, it can infect and damage PC
     hard disks containing other PC operating systems including UNIX,
     OS/2, and Novell.  Thus, booting an infected DOS floppy disk on
     a PC that has, for example, UNIX on the hard disk would infect
     the hard disk and would probably prevent the UNIX disk from
     booting.  The virus infects floppy disk boot sectors and hard
     disk master boot records (MBRs).  When the user boots from an
     infected floppy disk, the virus installs itself in memory and
     infects the partition table of the first hard disk (if found).
     Once the virus is installed, it will infect any floppy disk that
     the user accesses.

     Some possible, though not conclusive, symptoms of the
     Michelangelo virus include a reduction in free/total memory by
     2048 bytes, and some floppy disks that become unusable or display
     "odd" graphic characters during "DIR" commands.  Additionally,
     integrity management products should report that the MBR has been
     altered.

     Note that the Michelangelo virus does not display any messages on
     the PC screen at any time.

II.  Impact

     The Michelangelo virus triggers on any March 6.  On that date,
     the virus overwrites critical system data, including boot and
     file allocation table (FAT) records, on the boot disk (floppy or
     hard), rendering the disk unusable.  Recovering user data from a
     disk damaged by the Michelangelo virus will be very difficult.

III. Solution 

     Many versions of anti-virus software released after approximately
     October 1991 will detect and/or remove the Michelangelo virus.
     This includes numerous commercial, shareware, and freeware
     software packages.  Since this virus was first detected around
     the middle of 1991 (after March 6, 1991), it is crucial to use
     current versions of these products, particularly those products
     that search systems for known viruses.
        
     The CERT/CC has not formally reviewed, evaluated, or endorsed any
     of the anti-virus products.  While some older anti-virus products
     may detect this virus, the CERT/CC strongly suggests that sites
     verify with their anti-virus product vendors that their product
     will detect and eradicate the Michelangelo virus.

     The CERT/CC advises that all sites test for the presence of this
     virus before March 6, which is the trigger date.  If an infection
     is discovered, it is essential that the user examine all floppy
     disks that may have come in contact with an infected machine.

     As always, the CERT/CC strongly urges all sites to maintain good
     backup procedures.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT/CC wishes to thank for their assistance: Mr. Christoph
Fischer of the Micro-BIT Virus Center (Germany), Dr. Klaus Brunnstein
of the Virus Test Center (Germany), Mr. A. Padgett Peterson, P.E., of
the Technical Computing Center at Martin-Marietta Corp., and Mr. Steve
R. White of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center.

Subj:	From the people who brought you Random Billing (tm)


	I never did like Sprint, but now I have another reason. I picked
this up on UseNet, in the Risks Forum:

---- quote ----
From: jpallen@ics.uci.edu
Subject: US Sprint offering phone fraud insurance

It's been reported that US Sprint is trying to "transform a billion-dollar
industrywide problem into a source of income" by offering phone fraud insurance
to its customers (Information Week, 2/3/92).  Discussions about the conflict
of interest inherent in making a "security industry" financially dependent on
a thriving security problem suddenly seem much less far-fetched...

Is security against phone fraud something that Sprint, a company that doesn't 
require the use of PINs on their calling cards, should be asking its
customers to pay for?

Jonathan Allen, University of California, Irvine
CORPS (Computers, ORganizations, Policy, and Society) program

---- quote ----

	So, let's see if I read this straight. U.S. Sprint, a company
famous for placing randomly generated calls on your bill just to see if
you notice, is now going to charge you "insurance" to cover the costs
of those calls you didn't make, but that you were not allowed to keep
others from making. Ah, Progress.

	Keep in mind that the LD companies are currently lobbying
fairly heavily to extend into the LATA, that is, soon you will need
to specify which LD carrier handles all your "message unit" calls,
and, of course, your local bill will go up to provide for "equal
access", even if you make _no_ out of area calls.

Proposal for Monitor Specs:

   1. I would like the monitor to come with an isolation transformer and 
      whatever else it needs for power (i.e. no special, separate winding.)

   2. I would like to have the monitors be able to accept video inputs
      of 1V. This would allow the monitors to accept the video directly
      from a standard video palette IC like the type used in PCs. (Reducing
      the video levels might also reduce emissions.)

   3. I would like monitors that operate from medium speed (25KHz Horizontal,
      60 Hz Vertical).

   4. I would like monitors that operate at VGA format and speed (640x480, 
      non-interlaced). If they can produce a 19" VGA Monitor for a reasonable 
      cost they will sell zillions. Currently, 19" VGA monitors sell for 
      thousands of dollars.

In the rain over the weekend my neighbour noticed the ground bubbling 
between our two houses. The bubbles burned quite well too. Either we
were sitting on a Natural Gas well  or the PG&E gas line was leaking.
Unfortunately, the latter was true.

It was only noticeable because the ground was so wet that you could 
see the bubbles. 
It may be worth your while to take a look where your gas line runs 
during the next rain storm. I can only wonder how long the leak was 
there. Possibly years. At least the leak was before the meter.

Subj:	March 6, Michaelangelo Virus Wake Up Call


I heard a good suggestion on the "SILICON VALLEY REPORT", Channel 54, last nite.
They said that the virus could be defeated easily if, on March 5


on March 5th, you change
your computer date to March 7th. Just skip the day of March 6. The virus is set
to attack if the date is equal to March 6, 1992 only. If the virus never sees
March 6, it just remains dormant forever.  See the difference between "EQUAL TO"
an "EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN".

Subj:	what the hell are copywrites for, anyway??


 I found an interesting discussion of copywrite on the Internet by Richard Stallman
 (of GNU fame/notoriety).  Although the model he's using is music (specifically,
 the issue of DAT taping) it's equally pertinent to game software.

 It's too big to send out to everyone; but if you're interested, just look at

Subj:	DEPARTMENTAL CHANGES


Please note the upcoming changes in our sales department:

Effective April 1, Anne Hayes will be appointed as Import/
Export Manager in our newly created International Business
Department.  Reporting directly to me, she will be responsible
for sales in the Far East, Australia and South America, and
will handle all import and export sales activities for 
licensed product.  Anne has done a great job in domestic
sales and I know she will be a tremendous asset for the
growth of our company.

Effective March 2, Elaine Shirley will be moving within the
domestic sales organization as Regional Sales Manager,
responsible for the western half of the country.  Jim
Newlander will continue to handle the eastern half (divided
roughly at the Mississippi River).

As head of the Customer Service Department for the past seven
years, Elaine has acquired vast experience dealing with both
distributors and operators on a daily basis.

Holly LaMontagne will be replacing Elaine as Customer Service
Manager effective March 2.  Holly is a familiar name at Atari 
Games as she worked here for 10 years in manufthe manufacturing and                  
inventory planning groups.  Since 1984, she has managed the 
customer service group at Wyse Technology, a computer and
terminal manufacturer.  With Holly's expertise, Atari Games
will continue to have the #1 service department in the industry.

Subj:	68020 vs 68000 performance


	I recently converted my program from 68000 to 68EC020.  I thought
there might be others interested in the performance increase from the 68020.
The following is my mileage, yours will certainly vary.

	Both systems were running at 14.1MHz.

	In both cases the C compiler is gnu C 1.40.  OSM generates better 
code on the 68000 although I cannot run it on the 68020.

	In both cases the program is running with 1 wait state (for SLOOP
and 100ns ROMs).

	ASIC is used just for sin, cos, atan, and TRANSVEC (transform unit
vectors into another frame of reference).

	I will define a time of 1.0 to be the running time of my program on
the 68000 without the ASIC.  .4 would mean the program would run in 40% of 
the time.

	time	configuration
	1.0	68000 
	 .8	68000, with ASIC
	 .8	68020, 16 bit bus, 68000 code 
	 .74	68020, 16 bit bus, 68000 code, with ASIC
	 .65	68020, 16 bit bus, 68000 code, cache on
	 .55	68020, 32 bit bus, 68000 code
	 .5	68020, 32 bit bus, 68000 code, cache on
	 .45	68020, 32 bit bus, 68020 code (MULS.L used)
	 .42	68020, 32 bit bus, 68020 code (MULS.L used), cache on
	 .42	68020, 32 bit bus, 68020 code (MULS.L and DIVS.L used)
	 .38	68020, 32 bit bus, 68020 code (MULS.L and DIVS.L used), cache on

	The 68020 seems to be better than twice as fast as the 68000.

	The results show that the ASIC should not be used for small routines
like sin and atan where the 68020 will run faster that it takes to get the
info to and from the ASIC.

	It is also quite clear that changing just two of my most used routines 
(TRANSVEC and atan2) to use the MULS.L and DIVS.L instructions is well worth it.

The result is that this machine runs faster than any 286 machines out there,
but slower than an actual 16-bit AT bus 386.  It is has a quirk or two
which makes it more difficult to run windows.  I have purchased a copy of
Windows from Intel which supports this card and has the patches required
in it.  I am including this software with the machine.  It still would
prefer to run windows in "real" or "standard" mode instead of 386 enhanced
mode, however (it is much faster in standard mode).

The rest of the machine:
	2 20Mbyte hard disks
	1 1.44Mbyte (3.5") floppy
	1 360k (5") floppy
	16Mhz 386 with 3Mbyte of 32-bit RAM
	XT keyboard
	1 serial port, 1 parallel port (more if you really need it)

	The machine is ready to run EXCEPT that it has no graphics card
	or monitor.

Software included is: DOS 3.3, Windows 3.0.  It will boot up on the "C"
drive with DOS 3.3

This machine is the "high end" of "low end" machines!!!
$450 or best offer...

	I just realized I did not copy over your self test into my Steel 
Talons directory.  I am about to do an archive of the Steel Talons directory 
and I would like to put the self test source in the archive.  What directory
should I look at?  Has the DSPCOM, DSPLINK, ... self test code changed any
since Steel Talons?

Steel Talons Self-Test is in [Margolin.Aces] . It is what we sent out in the
game.

Peter Lipson redid DSPLINK and took all of Self-Test out of the Boot ROM,
causing lots of people lots of pain (and wasted time) especially me.

If you want 2105 source code for the boot rom that we shipped in the game
I can give it to you.

It is on the PC only. Some of the files are in binary so I have not uploaded

that I divided out of my yard this weekend. They grow great in full sun,
grow about 6 ft.+ tal with Yellow flowers. They also will give yor yard
a rather Tropical touch. I still have plenty in my yard but they do need to
be divided occasionally. Anyway, if you want them, just respond and I'll
tell you where they are.

		Great time of the year to plant them.

       Software Development 92 - Santa Clara Convention Center - Feb 1992

        I attended several seminars at the show as well as the expo.  The
following are  exceprts that I thought may interest PC users.  If you are
interested in any seminar or  product I may have literature.



EXPO:

Microsoft

        Microsoft has claimed that it has sold over 9 million WINDOWS 3.0
copies.  96  million copies of MS-DOS. (compared to 6.5 million for Macintosh,
1 million for PC Unix and 1.2 million for OS/2 -- data from IDC and Software
Publishing Assoc., Oct 91 and Nov 91)
 
	C/C++ 7.0 - MS introduced their new C/C++ compiler.  It includes the SDK
for  WINDOWS 3.1 and a class browser.  The Programmer's Workbench is still DOS
based but this  doesn't seem to pose a problem because of the advances made to
the WINDOWS DOS-box in  WINDOWS 3.1.  The Class Browser is different than
Borland's Turbo C; it is text-based and  a bit more extensive.  I picked up data
comparing the two compilers from both companies.   Generally, they both seem to
have made strides in the areas that they were lacking.  I  would not choose the
compiler on it's compilation speed, EXE size/speed as they are pretty  dead even
(according to published data - both companies acknowledge this after you get 
past the advertisments).  Availability 4-6 weeks. $495 or $139 upgrade to ANY
MS-DOS C  compiler.  Product includes WINDOWS 3.1 SDK.
  
        WINDOWS 3.1 - New features: OLE 1.0, Multimedia API and PEN API
included, Mouse  input can be sent to MS-DOS app, different font sizes available
in windowed MS-DOS apps,   hi-res VGA MS-DOS apps run in a window, persistent
network connections, better error  checking, truetype, drag/drop from
FileManager to ProgramManager, better FileManager, etc... SDK to be available
after 3.1 ships.

	WIN32 & NT - I attended several MS seminars on WIN32 and NT.  For those
unfamiliar:   WIN32 is the 32-bit version of WINDOWS.  NT (New Technology) is
basically the DOS  replacement (although there is no CLI).  MS claims both WIN32
and NT will be  cross-platform independent.  So far only 2 processors are
supported (Intel-x86 and  MIPS-RISC), but both MS and DEC have announced the
possibility of DEC's Alpha-RISC being  supported.  WIN32 is fully 32-bit code,
supports true multitasking (pre-emptive,  multi-threaded, asynchronous message
queue), supports structured exception handling,  security, builtin Network API,
and the usual improvements to WIN16 that you would expect.   BTW, MS says that
WIN32 will also work on top of DOS 6.0
NT/WIN32 to be available late 92 (better count on early 93 -- although both are
in beta).   SDK for WIN32 to be available summer 92. 

Borland
        Announced Borland C++ for OS/2.  Also the usual claims that their
products are  better than MS's.   Availability:  ???

Digitalk
        No new announcements.  They will ship their Smalltalk implementation for
WINDOWS  3.1 when WINDOWS 3.1 ships.  It will support OLE.  For those unfamiliar
with the Digitalk  line:

        Product                 Platform
        -------------------------------------------------
        Smalltalk /V Win 1.1:   Windows 3.0
        Smalltalk /V PM 1.3     OS/2 1.3
        Smalltalk /V 286        DOS with extended memory manager for 286
        Smalltalk /V DOS        MS-DOS
        Smalltalk /V Mac        Macintosh

Smalltalk /V PM 2.0 in beta for OS/2 2.0.  Smalltalk /V Win 1.2 in beta for
Windows 3.1. I've seen both on both platforms.  They are ready to ship.

Watcom
        WATCOM C - didn't visit both.  They made an annoucement but I didn't
attend.

Zinc 
        Zinc C - didn't visit booth.

There were several C++ products for sale for various platforms by various
vendors.   Unfortunately the class compatibility issue has still not been
addressed.  I visited  most booths.  Some vendors and their products:

Vendor          Product
----------------------------------------------------------------
Blaise          WIN++   A C++ class library for WINDOWS using Borland C++ 
                (also announced future library to support MS C/C++ 7.0)
ImageSoft       IconoClass - A browser and development environment for C++
                development for Windows, PM and Motif.
                Glockenspiel - C++ compiler
                CommonBase - SQL and ISAM C++ libraries
Premia          Codewright - WINDOWS programming editor.  Not specifically for
		C++ but does have C++-type editing available.  We've used this
		editor and probably the best WINDOWS editor so far.


SEMINARS:

        I attended the following seminars. I have notes to these seminars if you
would  like to borrow and photocopy:
        
                Enhancements and New Capabilities in Windows 3.1
                Windows NT Overview        
                Dynamic Data Exchange for WINDOWS
                Introduction to Object Linking and Embedding (I have extensive 
                    documentation and examples provided by MS)
                Real World Smalltalk
                Class Libraries and Standardization
                Developing Multimedia Applications for Windows
                The Object Windows Interface to C++
                Programming MultiMedia Extensions
                Getting Ready for Windows-32
                Methodology for Humans

It's amazing how much you learn when shopping around for a new car.  This note
is to all of you I have spoken to recently about automobile shopping, and all 
others who may be in the market for a new (or used) car.

CA Auto Assn has a new service to members called Vehicle Pricing.  For a fee
of $12.50 per new model year vehicle they will send you complete information
on Manufacturers Suggested Retail Pricing and data on dealer's invoice for
all available options.  Nice info to have in hand while shopping around.
They can also print out data for used vehicles (handy for that trade-in).
Their number is (800) 272-2877.

Happy shopping!

     You're both not quite right, based on what I was told by someone who
used to work at Atari.  "Atari" is indeed a go term; when you say "Atari" to
your opponent, you're saying that your position is so good that, no matter what
your opponent does, you're going to win.  So it's not really like saying 
"check" (since you can often get off a few desperation checks even in a
hideous position); more like saying "mate in four" or whatever.  It's also
sometimes used in contexts besides go; it more or less means "I've got you!"
     Whether or not this makes "Atari" an appropriate name for the company is
left firmly unaddressed. :)
     By the way, while I'm on the subject of Atari, I remember reading
somewhere that once a year, all the Atari employees got up on the roof of their
building and screamed "Atari!" across the Silicon Valley.  And shortly 
afterward, all the Apple employees got up on the roof of their building and
screamed "Screw you!" right back.  Can anyone confirm or deny this?

Ed Rotberg's picnic will be held at Cardoza Park, in Milpitas.  It has a
baseball diamond, complete with bleachers, half court hoops, lots of grass
and picnic tables, and even a SHUUZ pit.  I heard it might rain on Friday.
In that case, we'll have to relocate to a covered area.  If anyone knows of
a place we could eat our lunches that is protected from the rain, please
let me know.  Ed just wants a nice place where we can get together and talk.

Directions to Cardoza Park:
  Take 237/Calaveras to Park Victoria, the 1st light after you go under 680.
  Turn Left on Park Victoria.
  Turn Right at the first stop sign, onto Kennedy.
  Park is on the right, just after you turn.

There is a parking lot, and plenty of street parking.

If you want to come and haven't given me your order yet, it's not too late.
I'll send one more reminder tomorrow morning, for you  procrastinators (and
for show attendees).

In case it rains on Friday, the contingency plan for Ed's Going Away Picnic
is to have it at a park in Sunnyvale, under a covered area.  The park is called
Orchard Garden, just off 237, near Mathilda.  It appears on the big map in the
admin dept.  It's pretty easy to get there.  Just take 237 to Mathilda
(south, so turn left) then turn left at the first light.  The park is on that
street, but the name escapes me.  I'll give more precise directions if we need
to use Plan B.  Meanwhile, hope for a sunny day on Friday.

If you haven't replied with your lunch order, please do so before lunch.  If you
want to go, but want to bring your own lunch, still send a reply, so we know
how many of you are coming.  If you can't make it, Ed will be here Friday
morning, so you can say goodbye to him then.

Thanks,

  I do not know what the program is; you should check a newspaper.
I believe that they are pretty good (~$60) seats.

  When my brother was living here last summer, before an unexpected
relocation to Southern California, he bought a season subscription
to the ballet.  I received these tickets in the mail 2 days ago, because
he is unable to use them.

An answer to your question would be more forthcoming if the premise

 Well you're probably too busy to read this and frankly I wouldn't blame
you for not wanting to hear about it even if you were'nt busy.  But for
what it's worth I wanted to follow your suggestions on setting up an
isolation xfrmr and a couple of incandescent bulbs to test my boards, &
I did.   First of all what's strange is that all the boards work perfectly
on the game with motors and all... but when I run the test on my bench the
bulbs glow, then get brighter and then fully bright.  
 So if none of this makes any sense to you (makes no sense to me), del
this message and forget about it.  But by chance if you've run into this
too drop me a line.

Sorry everybody!  Happy Hour starts at 4:00 until 8:00 p.m.
I understand you're in for a real treat.  This place is the
talk of the town and People Magazine.  There's a restaurant
inside called "The Cave" too.  If anyone out there decides to
go, give me some feedback.

Thanks.

Have you ever labored long and hard to build the doghouse of your mutt's
dream and not been able to get the dog to go inside? If so, I could use
it. I need a house for a large dog and maybe room for another small dog.
I don't have time to build one and I need it right away.

Give me a call if you can help me with my pooches......3727.

No one to my knowledge has stopped by to hear the EXIT demo.
Perhaps we could set up a specific meeting for the demo if that is more

In any case, I encourage all, especially project leaders and game designers,

	We seem to have a few game backdoors in the hardware lab that are

So if you have games that are missing a rear door these seem to be claimable.
They seem to even have keys with them. If they don't fit right, you can probably
have Connie cut them to fit.

Subj:	Corporate Childcare


As a pending "father to be", the nightmare of finding
childcare is presenting is ugly head.  Over the last
few days I have been looking into the concept of Atari
being involved in "Corporate Childcare".  Unfortunately,
Atari is too small a company by itself to support this,
but we are not to small to get involved in a "Corporate
Childcare Consortium".  This consortium involves several
small companies (imagine the number in our industrial
park alone) pulling thier financial resources to support
a childcare facility.  The added power of a consortium
often means better care and more attention for the children.

NOTE: There is already one company in our area, I think
they're called "Beck and Dickenson", that is looking for other
companies to form a childcare consortium.

If you are interested trying to get Atari involved in
some sort of childcare program send me (BURGESS) vaxmail.
With enough interest maybe we can get Atari to finally do
something.

Thanks for your time,

Andrew J Burgess

Human-Computer Interaction 1992

I was unaware that a conference was dedicated to this science.  I sent away
for the program on this conference from Stanford to see what it is about.
From the brochure detailing the activities, it looks as though we could
benefit by attending.  Some of the Tutorials (of the 37 available):

* Virtual Reality and Highly Interactive Three Dimensional User Interfaces
* Early Design Methodology for Usable Products and Documentation
* Film Craft in User Interface Design
* Introduction and Overview of Human-Computer Interaction
* A Cost-effective Technique for Refining the Usability of Prototype Systems
* Innovating Interfaces: Concept Creation and Visualization
* Product Usability Survival Techniques
* Interactive Learning Environments


And some samples from the WORKSHOPS (8 available):
* Cross-Cultural perspecitives on HCI
* Advances in Computer-Human Interaction in Complex Systems

There are also Panels

This year's conference is in Monterey.  Unfortunately the conference begins in
early May.  If you would like to see the detailed program send me a message
or stop by my office.

Subj:	Creativity and Innovation


I don't think we are short of creative people with creative ideas.  The problem
is that management has structured the company in such a way as to inhibit
innovative ideas from surfacing.  There currently is no way to start and carry
through these creative and exciting projects.  If management is  serious about
creativity they would set up a structure to channel these ideas.  Since there is
no channel, they must not be too serious.  It is management's responsibility to
make the best of what they have sitting in front of them.

Subj:	New telephone system (notes"


As of April 20th 1992, All employees must first dial an   8  in order
to abtain an outside line. We are currently using 9 to dial out, but
due to Tengen's extentions starting with 9, we had to change it to 8.
You may not know but in reality Tengen's extentions start with a 9
instead of a 4. As of April 20th, whenever dialing a Tengen extention
you must also include the 9, for example :

                   Deborah Geyer's extention is  427

                   As of April 20th, will be     9427.

There will be no three digit extentions as of April 20th.

Subj:	

	First of all, Brad, good luck getting much response to your message. We
are all either tired, dead or overscheduled. You can see it in the vaxmail.
No one responds anymore to humor, snivelgrams, or political commentary.
People ask me all the time why I don't write many messages anymore. Because
I don't get any replies.  I didn't get any remarks concerning "Virtual
Olfaction" (come one, what an opening line.) We didn't even have any April
Fool's Day pranks.

			WAKE UP, EVERBODY!

	Now back to your question, Brad. You know I agree with you completely!
I give up trying to be creative. The creativity is here and always has been.
There never has been a good way to tap it. If you step back and look, this
company is made up of many very interesting individuals who are involved in
a diverse set of activities and skills. We are a group of people who are
intelligent, clever, involved, and possess a good sense of humor and sharp
wits. So where is the creativity going?
	We have brainstorming sessions where good ideas are collected. Then
what happens with those ideas? How are the people that have those ideas
rewarded? How are "diverse" ideas greeted?
	(Answer: We don't know that market. We don't have qualified personnel
to handle that. We don't have the time or money to investigate that.)
	I won't snivel about my own experiences with creativity. If you don't
mind, Rusty, I'll site yours. How many years ago did Rusty suggest, through
proper channels (brainstorming), to do Network games???? Here was an idea
that poised almost no financial exposure to the company save his salary. No
expensive controls, cabinets and PCB's that may end up lanquishing in the
store room. Was he met with open arms?

	Wasn't Hard Drivin' meant to be a driving training simulator?
	Wasn't BMX meant to be a simulator and not a game? (oops, sniveling)
	What happened to our fancy 3D hardware project group?

	If you are a game programmer, hardware engineer, or close friends with
either, you have a chance at seeing your idea happen. If you are not, you
might as well just forget it. If you use your own time and resourses to
convince someone you have a good idea, you might see it happen. But you will
be told over and over again that having an idea isn't worth anything. Only
implementing an idea has value. The company has no insight into that some
people may have vision, even though they may not have the skill to implement
them. Bonuses are paid to the implementors.
	What's the answer to all of this? I really don't know anymore. Maybe a
good starting point would be to acknowledge the creativity in all of us and
not just a few.

Subj:	Attn: PROGRAMMERS - new rules on the OS


All programmers are asked to ALWAYS get the latest version of the OS
from Flanagan/Lipson/Albaugh as you start a project. In fact, 
if you are in a project that has not reached Focus group, please CONVERT to the
latest OS. Also, please read all the applicable documentation.
Bob, Peter, and Mike put quite a bit of work in the latest version of the
OS to make it easier to configure and hopefully more user friendly. 

In the future please plan to update your game to the newest release of the
OS at least right after Focus group time (or equivalent if your project
skips focus). 

Think of this as a professional courtesy to your co-workers that have developed
the OS to help you. If that doesn't work for you, think of it as a prerequiste
for your next raise (just kidding, I think).

Carole,

I'm sure it's been said before, but for what my opinion is worth, 
I think one of the most important comments you made is the last sentence
in your next-to-last paragraph: "Bonuses are paid to implementors."

People respond to rewards, and the reality is that money is a major
reward.

I was very surprised that so many people got upset, felt threatened,
ran for cover, etc., when the Tengen group sent out humorous
20th anniversary slogans.

regards,
Chris

Subj:	Who gets to say what a successful game will be?


I agree that there is a problem in gettting your idea to market if you are
not a programmer.  It appears that Atari is not set up to use ideas that come
from people other than the programmers and game designers, unless these people
can be convinced (through pitch sessions or otherwise) that these ideas will be
the next smash hit.  Part of the reason that this is so is because when it
comes to evaluating ideas, there is no right or wrong.  Who is to say what will
be successful and what won't?  No one really knows, so the person(s)
responsible for the project makes the call.

Part of reason why things are set up the way they are is that the programmers
must be 100% behind the project that they are working on.  The work required
for a successful game is too demanding for a half-hearted attitude.  Too many
late nights and weekends are required to be merely an implementor of someone
else's idea.  Also, the project leader must shoulder the burden of an
unsucessful product.  It's difficult enough to do when it was your idea.  If
a flop was someone else's idea, it would be even more difficult to swallow.

So this is the way it works now.  Is this the best way?  I don't know.  But I do
know of another way.  Other companies have a position known as a "Producer." 
Producers are responsible for designing all of the games, then they just dole
them out to the programmers.  Programmers become mostly implementors,
although they do have the oppurtunity to convince the producer that their ideas
are worth implementing.  But the producers get the final say in everything.
They are also responsible for the scehduling, and the success or failures of
all the projects.  For a staff of our size, we would have only 2 - 4 producers.
They would act as a funnel for ideas that get turned into games.  They would be
"the way" that the creativity in all parts of the company could be accessed.
They are different from what we call project leaders in that programmers
are never producers, and the ratio of projects to producers is more than 1:1.
Also, producers can have a more global picture of the company resources and
needs, since they are a part management, and do no technical work.  The company
can more directly drive the direction of our products through the producers.

There are many problems, however, with this approach.  There would be fewer
people responsible for the ideas that come out of Atari.  This could mean
less diversity in ideas.  Also, I believe the programmers would be unhappy
about not getting to implement their own ideas.  Unhappy employees are
unproductive employees.  I can only speak for myself for sure, but I believe
that part of the reason that many programmers choose to program here rather
than any of the other zillion companies in the valley is that we get to choose
what we want to work on.  Companies that use producers often have trouble
keeping their good programmers because they don't get enough freedom to design
their games.  Working under producers could possibly be like living under
a dictatorship.  The company's success would be directly linked to the quality
of its 2 or 4 producers.  Sounds risky to me.

In summary, using producers is one way of accessing creativity in all parts of
the company.  I know of 2 companies that are successfully using this approach. 
These 2 companies are prospering.  However, I'm not sure if this would work here
at Atari.  There are reasons for the way things are.  Management takes a
"convince me" approach, and if convinced, the project is initiated.  They could
take a more aggressive approach, more clearly defining and driving the direction
of the projects.  But that's not the way it is.  Management can change this,
if they think it will work best.  So far, I haven't heard that.

And Carole, you seem to have had some success in getting your ideas started.
Stun Runner and BMX Heat both came from brainstormings, I believe.  Bonnie's
game is starting up, also from Brainstorming.  It's not like programmers are
completely closed to ideas from other people.

Subj:	Creativity - Brad/Carol/Chris/Howard & Mark


I normally don't participate in the junk mail chit chat because I'm one of those
"OVERSCHEDULED" individuals that Carol made reference to.  I felt compelled to
attempt to respond Brad's comments and share my perspective of what creativity
means to me.

In its most pure form CREATIVITY equates to "ORIGINAL" and/or "INNOVATIVE". Many
times people engaged in disciplines outside of the discipline that generated
something creative, confuse that creativity, if it is recognized, with "CLEVER".
The trap of confusing "CLEVER" with "CREATIVE" is typically due to an ignorance
of the idiosycratic nature of the other discipline. It is not untypical that a
person working within a discipline can be very creative and that creativity can
be ignored, not recognized, and often taken for granted because the person that
evaluated the results of that creativity may be ignorant of the details of that
discipline.

The problem of ignorance is often draped over by the corporate Balance Sheet.
The universal bottom line in evaluating the corporate worth of creativity is
the Balance Sheet which is the upper management bible the quantifies the worth
of creativity.  It is the Balance Sheet bulge that defines the monetary (bonus)
reward for creativity.

In this company, Programmers, Hardware Engineers, and their technical support
staff have the highest visibility, because they develop the games that provide
the major contribution to the Balance Sheet bulge.  This is the corporate
nature of ATARI Games, an Engineering Driven company, and the consequent lion
share of the reward goes to that segment of the company.

To me, the reward of creativity, is my own satisfaction knowing I did something
creative, it works, and it contributes to the benifit and sucess of the company
and it's employees.  All of us in our own way are creative. The degree that the
creativity is recognized by people within the company relies on their perception
of its worth to them.  A successful game is worth something to all ATARI employees
because it is reflected in their contiued employment and bonus.

Is it all fair ??? I don't know.  Fair is defined by those in position, with
the power, to reward creativity.  In any case we should strive to always be
creative in everything we do lest we fall prey to a golem state of existance.

Thanx....Tom

ps: Look over your shoulder the rest of the world is gaining on us.

ISN'T THIS FABULOUS!
Sometimes when we struggle to come up with something elegant or exciting
or special we may tend to feel jaded, overburdened and frustrated because 
things aren't coming around as fast as we feel they should.  I think that
"creativity controversy" is great because it's shaking out some cobwebs in
folks that would otherwise keep their feelings to themselves and brood.

I thought I would put in my two cents worth, simply because I can.  Don't

	If you'd like something interesting to do tonight, and are

"live" the rock musical "Jesus Christ Superstar". The Los Altos
United Methodist youth choir is putting it on.  It's at 7:30pm,
Foothill Expressway and Magdelena in Los Altos, $5 at the door. And
if you haven't heard it yet (under 30), i think you'd like it, too.
I saw a production is S.F. last year, and i think this one may be 
even better (eventhough some of the performers are quite young). Of

Subj:	TRAVEL POLICY


        Effective April 1, 1992, the corporate travel policy will be
        adhered to with no exceptions.
        There were several revisions that came into effect Jan 31, 1992
        that I would like to summarize for you;

             Travel reservations must be made and ticketed through
             the company approved travel agency.
             An employee must be away from home (24) consecutive
             hours of more to be eligible to claim expenses for
             meals and/or lodging.
             Meal expenses will be reimbursed to a maximum of $50
             per day.
             Laundry and valet service will be reimbursed only when
             the duration of the trip is greater than (5) days.
             (1) personal phone call per day NTE $15.00
             Employees will not be reimbursed for hotel movie charges.
             Room Service should not be used unless essential.
             All receipts are required.  (A handwritten resturant stub
             is not sufficient.
             Employees must submit expense reports within (14) days
             from completion of travel for out of pocket/cash expenses,
             when a travel advance has been issued an expense report
             must be submitted (7) days after completion of travel.
             When a travel advance exceeds actual supported expenses
             submit a personal check with the expense report.
             Employees with outstanding travel advances will not
             receive additional travel advances or be authorized to
             travel.
             
             If you have any questions, please contact myself of
             Jocelyn Kane in the Accounting Dept.

Subj:	Name That Thang


And a Hearty Howdy to everybody:

*****WAHOOO!  ITS A CONTEST!   WITH A PRIZE FOR THE WINNER!!*******

Simulation Products is faced with a prickly challenge: What do we call our 
driver training simulator? Lots of names have been suggested, hurled, called,
or otherwise communicated, and while nothing has been categorically ruled
out (except perhaps  "Car 54"), there must be a great one out there, 
lurking in the shadows of someone's imagination....

The inital target market for the trainer is the law enforcement community,
and while most of us probably don't have a lot of exposure to this world,
names which evoke feelings or ideas associated with law & order might be a good 
area to explore.  Cops have a sense of humor,too (occasionally).

Some of the feelings or concepts we may want to convey in the product name 
include: dynamic, interactive, many vehicles at once, judgement, wisdom, grace 
under pressure, hi-tech, computer generated imagery, police lingo, exciting, 
fast, sure, discriminating, rational decision making, quick decision making, 
etc, etc...  We're open to a wide range of ideas.

Rules of the Game:  Outright names are OK, as are acronymns. The name ATARI 
cannot be used because the product is not a game, but the name could possibly 
be referred to in an acronymn via the letter "A"  If you submit an acronymn,
also specify the words which each of the letters stand for.

FIRST PRIZE:  ONE WEEK IN CLEVELAND

SECOND PRIZE:  TWO WEEKS IN CLEVELAND

OK, OK

THE REAL FIRST PRIZE:	WHATEVER YOU WANT (as long as it costs less than 25 
			bucks)

			PLUS; your name in the credits as the genius who 
			thought of this clever name.

Some of the names tossed up so far  (now don't be judgemental...):

AMOS	(Atari games corp Mobile Operations Simulator)
DES	(Driving Environment Simulator)
ASP	(Atari Simulation Products)
TAGCAR	
SAFE	
PLATO	
RAMBO
PARTNER
MOBETA SIMULATION
P-25
XP-92 TRAINER
CODE THREE 
A.T.A.R.I.	(Advanced Training Automation Resources Inc)

Subj:	New MIT Press Journal: PRESENCE


A new journal from MIT Press.  Here's their ad:

"Both the fields of teleoperators and virtual reality have grown rapdily over
recent years.   Yet, until now, neither field has had it own scientific
publications.  PRESENCE, beginning with its first issue in winter 1992, will
offer specialists working in both fields - or anyone interested in following
these increasingly important disciplines - a much needed authoritative forum
for the exchange of vital research, ideas, devices and applications.

"The journal will interest mechanical and electrical engineers concerned
primarily with teleoperators; computer scientists, high-tech artists, and
media people concerned with virtual reality; and psychologists concerned
primarily with human-machine interfaces and with sensorimotor and cognitive
behavior."

Subj:	Gameroom Usage


We are in the midst of schools "Spring Breaks" and we have had a number of
children in the building, specifically the gameroom.  Add to this the fact that
we are heading toward summer vacation, makes it necessary once again to remind
employees with children about the use of Atari's gameroom.

We encourage employees and their guests to use the gameroom.  Children are not
to be left there alone without adult supervision.  Essentialy, the gameroom is
not intended to be an arcade where a child can spend the day or to act as a day
care while a parent is working at Atari or Tengen.

The primary function of the gameroom is for the benefit of the employees as a
form of relaxation.  It also serves as a public relations symbol for outside
business guests.  Therefore, please use your good judgement about the amount of
time you let your children have access to the gameroom.  If there is to be a
group of more than theee children, prior approval must be obtained from Human
Resources.

Also, children are not allowed to roam alone through the building or be in
possession of your Schlage (security) card.

Your adherence to this message is appreciated.  We'd prefer that you enforce
the gameroom rules rather than the Receptionists having to do so.

We have a fun product and we like to think we have "fun" while we work, but
remember, this is still a place of business.

logic families:

std. ttl 74xx

Shottkey 74sxx  <-------------
acl 	 74AC/ACTxx
10Kecl family.

In addition, the following is a partial list of devices that will be 
obsoleted from the continued product families:
74f13, 74f83, 74f151, 74f160a, 74f162a, 74f168, 74f190, 74f192,

I believe they are the first manufacturer to announce the removal of 
whole logic families.

Subj:	NEW PAGING PROCEDURE


The manner in which you go about being connected to a external caller who has
requested that you be paged is as follows:
     1.) The receptionist will page you to pick up a caller at a parked 
         location.
     ie.."Linda Paulo please pick-up 67"
     2.) You then go to the nearest available phone and dial the number 
         that you have been directed to "pick-up". 
         
If you get a busy, I probably made a mistake.

10. So that we can locate Counselor Troi from anywhere on the ship (me)

 9. So that we can finally answer those pesky "Would Captian Striker please
        go to the nearest white courtesy phone" pages (rusty)

 8. So that we can get phone calls in Atari's most popular conference rooms

 7. So engineers have something to aim at when they move the video games (lois)

Well, hello again Everybody:

In the spirit of Friday afternoon, and of fostering ongoing creativity, 
I am going to list the names that people have so far suggested for our
new driving simulators...

Can't say as though we have a winner yet, but with our add copy deadline 
rapidly approaching, we're going to have to come up with something good,
really soon.  Hopefully, seeing these suggestions will inspire those of
us who haven't yet contributed to gush forth with a wellspring of blindingly
inspirational stuff.  Or something.  Anything.   And if you've already replied,
but have thought of something else, let's hear it!

Read 'em and weep.  Hope to hear from you soon.  Reply to Graves or call me @
extension 3725.

Here they are,in all their unexplained glory:

ASDD;		ES92;		AMOS;		DES;		ASP;	
TAGCAR;		SAFE;		PLATO;		RAMBO;		PARTNER;
MOBETA;		WDNNSBT;	HSPT;		ST-1000;	C.O.P.-ulator
TSI;		THE STIMULATOR;	SQUAD CAR;	BLACK & WHITE;	ALBT;
ONE FOR THE ROAD;		FAST CHASER;	ASSAULT;	COP-O-MATIC;
COP-IN-A-BOX;	P-25;		CODE THREE;	DUIDD;		DWEEB

If you can do better, have at it!  Yea team!

I have set up a new system for the use of the truck.  If you need to
use the truck please obtain the keys from me and be sure and sign
the notebook that is on my bookshelf as you enter my cubicle.  I
have been nogotiating for our own gas credit card and for this
reason it becomes very important for you to sign for the truck and
return the charge slip to me if you put gas in the tank.  Apparently,
this did not work out too well in the past and the privelege of a
credit card was taken away by the creditor.  So, please, let's make
this work.  This will be certainly more convenient than having to
put out your own cash and then making out a petty cash voucher.  I
will inform all of you when we do have the card in our possession.

inhibit technology ideas from surfacing.  There currently is no way to start and
carry through these technologically exciting projects.  If management is serious
about technology they would set up a structure to channel these ideas.  Since
there is no channel, they must not be too serious.  It is management's
responsibility to make the best of what they have sitting in front of them.

I think a big part of the problem is that the project review process
holds all projects against the same standard, and because of this,
games with new technology, or game which try to exploit new ideas are
judged as slow or risky.  They are essentially penalized for trying something
new and creative.  I think it is time for an overhaul.  Reviews are more 
adversarial than they need to be.  They provide a poor level of access to the
knowledge base of the people doing the reviewing.

Subj:	techno leadership


well, new technology usually IS slow and risky....  we DO have a problem with
manpower especially hardware guys plus i don't like the current setup with
an 'advanced technology' group dominating the new stuff.  If i was to start
my next project using some new technology, for example a new 3-d or a CDRom
hardware, i'm sure that i'd have trouble convincing the review committee to
approve it.
  But i think it would be because there aren't enough products coming out of
engineering so i think i'd get resistance on a long-term project as long as they
need something to fill a slot within the next 18 months.  If not me, how many
other programmers do they have to produce a short-term product who will be
available soon?  Plus who's going to design a new hardware? How many available
engineers do we have?  And if i'm not willing to use the 3-d hardware from
the -Driving series, i bet that i'd have a hard time convincing the review
committee that our limited engineering resources should be used to create what
in their mind might be a hardware that is essentially redundant since we already
have a "3-D polygon hardware".

  My point is that I doubt that it's a lack of vision so much as it's a need
to weigh short-term problems that impacts our ability to use new technologies.
Also it's not easy to justify new technology sometimes; it's not realistic to
expect that we'd build expensive new stuff with no reason to think its earnings
will be much better than 'conventional' product.
  Since we DO need to gain expertise in new technologies if we want to be able
to compete in the future, we need to do two things.  We need to have enough
people to keep the products coming out even if a few teams work on longterm
projects, without being in a position where any failed project creates a hole
in the manufacturing cycle.  And we need to create new products where the
spin-offs are likely to be spread throughout the company.  We need to have
broad participation in any projects using advanced technologies or all we will
do is create pockets of expertise in the company that may or may not be easily
used in new generations.  We need to learn from the problems encountered by
teams trying to use the last several hardwares that have been introduced so
that new technology is more accessible to any new team that wants to use it.

Two problems: EE$USERDISK: is too full and, more importantly, it is dying.

Two files have been identified today as having unrecoverable read errors.

To correct both of these problems at once, I'm going to replace the drives
with newer bigger ones. What's important to you is that I'm going to do it
tonight (wednesday 4/29) beginning at about 10pm. I expect it'll take

I think it's interesting that in today's Merc there is an article about an
alliance between Time Warner, and IBM.  Guess what it's about?  NEW IDEAS.
NEW TECHNOLOGY (imagine that).  It's about combining TW's "vast" software
library and cable TV systems with IBM's computer technology.  "...In addition,
the two companies are seeking to create a generation of smart television that
would allow viewers to interact with services on their TV screens, using a
remote control or computer.  New services could include anything from 
entertainment to educational material and commercial transactions."  

Doesn't this sound like something we do here?  Don't we have connections
with Time Warner?

The article goes on to say that TW is not new to the idea of joint ventures.
Last October the company announced a joint venture with Electronic Arts (who?)
to "explore unspecified new projects in multimedia technology.  This is another
indication that Time Warner intends to be a leader in interactive media and
entertainment" said Bing Gordon, a vp at EA.

What's going on here.  Where were we?  Wouldn't this have been a golden
opportunity to justify hiring those people Lipson mentions?  Is there still
an avenue to pursue here?  Perhaps we think too much in terms of video 'games'.
Maybe we should start internalizing some of those popular buzzwords:
		Multimedia
		Interactive
		Interface
		Educational
		Learning Curve
		...etc.  
Are we not full of creative experts regarding these areas?

...just a thought

This is in reply to your Voice Mail message:

Phil told me on Tuesday that they would need actual parts. 

I told him that he should have Thom Dempsey call Rich Moore to get approval
and to say the following:

They need four samples each of:
	1. Parts that were received non-blank.
	2. Parts that did not program properly.

The parts that did not program properly contain large fragments of valid
code. In order to get parts, Thom will have to promise Rich Moore that
the parts are for failure analysis only:
	1. The parts will have the plastic removed; 
	2. The parts will be erased;
	3. The parts will be tested to see if they can be programmed.

The parts will not be read out until our code is erased.

Concerning the unit being used to program the parts. I am recommending
to Rick Moncrief that, starting immediately, the parts be programmed
on one of the two Data I/O machines that are alleged to be able to
program these parts. (Manufacturing's 2900 and McCarthy's Unisite)	   

I don't want to be in this loop anymore.

The Atari network will be unavailable this sunday 5/3/92 while Dave Shepperd

only noticable change is that the domain agc.com will go away. This is so
that we can be in sync with out email gateway to the outside world. The new
domain name will be agames.com, this means that you need to change all of
your references to agc.com to agames.com. The most likely place to look
would be in your .rhosts file. If all goes well people in the outside world

Subj:	210X DSP serial failures


  ::: Bug in 2105 DSP serial port :::

  We are experiencing failure of the serial receive port on the 210x DSP used
in SPACE.  The failure mode is that after successfully running for a while, the
DSP suddenly stops generating RCV interrupts even though the signals on the inputs
seem to be fine and internal control registers seem to be correctly set up.

  I spoke with Dan Ash (the A/D field app engineer) and he confirmed that other
customers have reported similar failures.  After a failure occurs, there is a way
for the DSP to reset its internal state to reset the port (assuming that the DSP
detects the failure with a watchdog).  Also, he recommended a filter circuit to
minimize the glitches that create the problem.

  The hardware should have an RC filter with a 68pF cap. and a 100 Ohm resistor
on the RCV SCLK line of the DSP.

  The software needs to reset the serial ports by disabling/re-enabling them when
the failure occurs.  It might be possible to prevent the error by resetting the
serial port whenever the DSP switches from INTERNAL SERIAL CLOCK to EXTERNAL SERIAL
CLOCK (which it does frequently).

  I am currently upgrading the software from STEEL TALONS to implement the new
resets;  we probably should investigate the RC filter for inclusion on any
new boards.

	HARDWARE DESCRIPTION OF "VIRTUALITY" PRODUCT


From: mike@highlite.uucp (Mike Wiik)
Organization: Gotham Communications Research

"The core of the system is the EXPALITY(TM) (Experience Provider for
Virtual Reality) computer, which uses a specially modified Amiga 3000
motherboard (sporting a 25MHz 68030 processor plus 68882 math copro-
cessor) to drive two parallel-pipeline TI 34020 graphics processors
turbocharged with two 40Mflop TI 34082 RISC math coprocessors, which
create up to 30,000 independently shaded polygons a second at 30 frames
per second on your visor's dual liquid-crystal color screens. Translation:
realistic and real fast.

"Polhemus 3D sensors (one in your helmet and another in your 3D joystick
or glove [??? -mike]) indicate which direction you're looking and firing
in and direct the quadraphonic digital sound tracking system. A 550MB
CD-ROM and 100MB Hard disk store the game's visuals, music, voice, sound
effects, and virtual-world database. Up to 12 [Twelve! Ay-yah!!!! -mike]
of these $65,000 Virtuality stations can be connected together, linked
by and Ethernet network. A 100-degree wide-angle visor is also in the 
works.

"The first game available is a shoot-em-up called Dactyl Nightmare (hint:
for a great ride, let the pterodactyl pick you up). Scheduled for March
installation is Dactly II, a "Capture The Flag" game in which combatants
get to maul each other with crossbows, shields, and axes and conspire
with teammates via a realtime digital voice synthesis system that changes
your voice to simulate the character you've selected...Also coming in
March: CYBERQUEST, a [D&D]-type role-playing game in a medieval setting
with a nice sci-fi touch: you buy private pluh-in keys that keep track
of where you are in the game, the character you've chosen...and how many
playing credits you have left.

"Other games available (but not yet planned for installations) are HERO
(hang gliding) and four sitdown games: BATTLESPHERE (3D space battle),
EXOREX (exoskeltal armored combat vehicle), VTOL (mission in Harrier
vertical takeoff jet plane), and TOTAL DESTRUCTION (stock car race).
Future games will include texture mapping (for realistic landscapes, etc)
and later, a combination of video and animation.

...

"You can experience ... Virtuality.. at:

	The Quarters, Kirkland, WA;
	Timeout, Springfield, VA;
	Forest Fair Mall, Cincinnati, OH;
	Adventure, Crestwood, MO;
	SmithHaven Mall, Long Island, NY; and
	U.C. Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.
	(Call 1-800-ILLUSION for updates)."

Above quoted w/out permission. So I'll just add it's a neat game which
we should feed our money to so they'll multiply and get neato new s/ware.

			COMBINE IDEAS

"The time has come," the walrus said, "to talk of many things: of shoes - and
ships - and sealing wax - of cabbages - and kings."  Combining unusual ideas
is at the heart of creative thinking.  The ancients mixed soft iron with even
softer tin to create hard bronze.  Gutenberg combined the wine press and the
coin punch to crete moveable type and the printing press.

What different ideas can you combine?

Subj:	Virtual Sex (warning sexually explicit & possibly offensive)


I'll take your suggestion seriously (whether you meant it that way or not).
A few months ago BAYCHI (the local chapter of the Computer Human Interface
interest group) did a meeting/lecture on electronic erotica and I brought
up the following point. Consider, what is the major objection to say child
pornograpy (before you say it, there is absolutely NO proof of a link
between pornography and sex crimes), it is the abuse and corruption of
minors (a point with which I agree.) But what happens when that factor is
removed? when you allow someone to participate in any fantasy they can conceive
in the privacy of their own homes, without involving anyone else. Is it
still a crime? wrong? immoral? Do you really believe that it isn't being 
worked on already? 

Inquiring minds want to know.....

5 DE MAYO
          "La batalla de Puebla".  The battle at Puebla, when the
  French army tried to invade Mexico coming from the Atlantic ocean
  they arrived at the city of Veracruz going towards Puebla to
  settled at the city and claimed it as a colony of France, they
  found themselves with a Mexican army that wasn't very strong in
  guns as the French army was at thart time, all they had was deter-
  mination to win and not to let anybody come and take their city
  and the richness the country had, after three days of fighting
  the French army started to realize that is wasn't so easy to se-
  ttled in and they had to retreat and give up the battle.
     Mexico takes this as a very important win because after this
  all other countries that were thinking on colonies on Mexican
  terretoty gave it a second thought to come and fight against
  Mexico.   
    
       THATS WHY THE CELEBRATION OF "5 DE MAYO"


     I hope this splains the reason of the celebration.

Subj:	Static Ram Pricing


It is increasingly important to pick preferred parts for Static RAMs 
in our new designs. 32Kx8 SRAMs are a good example right now. You can 
get a quotation from vendors for $6.15 each for 32Kx8, 25nS. But when 
Mary goes to buy them she pays over $8.00. She is buying from 
distribution because Manufacturer lead times are too long. 
However, if the same part is used in several upcoming games, she can 
spec buy with less risk.

I am asking Components engineering to call out 25nS and 70nS as the 
two preferred parts for 32Kx8 SRAMs. If you keep this in mind, we 
should be in a better pricing position later on.

Subj:	ADSP-210X


Peter Lipson's VAX Mail "210X DSP serial failures" implies that there is a
newly discovered bug in the 2105.

I talked to Dan Ash and it appears the "bug" in question is really that a
glitch on the Serial Clock input that is shorter than the minimum serial
clock specified in the data sheet can cause the state machine that performs
the serial operations to get screwed up so that it needs to be reset.

The Party Line Bus used in Steel Talons and in the Police Trainer allow the
bus to float after one unit has released it and before another unit
takes it.

The work we did on the Police Trainer System showed that when the bus is
floating, the output of the Bus Receivers will be one or zero, depending
on its own input offsets. (The receivers are actually op-amps in disguise.)   

This led to a real problem on the Frame Sync signal, which we fixed by 
introducing just enough bias so that a floating bus would be pulled to the
correct inactive polarity. 

It appears that something like this should be done with the Serial Clock.

Note: 1. The way this is done on a terminated bus is different from the way
         it is done on a non-terminated bus.

      2. I have not seen the SPACE circuit. It may or may not be the same as
         in Steel Talons.

      3. The 'filter' Dan recommended is about 9 ns and may or may not help
         glitches caused by the switching between Bus Masters.

Subj:	NUMFA Power-Up


Jed,

I took your suggestion to remove the interface connector before powering up 
the REV-2 NUMFA board.  A power spike is still evident on both of the motor
outputs, for a very short time.  Could this be due the lengthened watchdog
timeout?  This is the only difference between my board and your design that I
know of.

								Thanks,

Subj:	Ethernet cables


This is a quick lesson about how to hookup ethernet cable and how NOT to
hookup ethernet cable.

First a little background so you can attach some reason to the madness:

The cable is a transmission line and therefore abids by the rules established
with transmission line theory.

Transmission line theory says that, in an ideal case, if you were to connect a
device at any point along the transmission line, it would appear to the device
that the wire was infinitely long in either direction and that the wire would
have a uniform characteristic impedance in the frequency range that the device
intended to operate.

In the real world, the ideal case is rarely achieved. Any little thing will
likely change the impedance of the wire at that point. These include tight
kinks, connectors, poor connections and "stubs". What happens when a signal
runs across one of these changes in impedance is that some amount of it
bounces back to the point of origin (and this bounce point becomes the point
of origin for the reflected signal). This is also known as "ringing" and I'm
sure you've all had plently of (bad) experience with dealing with that on
circuit boards. The amount of signal reflected depends on how severe the
impedance mismatch is. If it's severe enough (as is would be with a
dead short or an open circuit), almost all of the signal will be reflected.

In long lines transmission, a "ring" or bounce may take 100's of nanoseconds
make the round trip, so for circuits that are expecting to deal with bit rates
of 100ns, (as is ethernet), this can be rather nasty.

Now for the meat of the issue:

The standard established for ethernet cabling was designed such that 
inconsistencies in the cable (impedance mismatches) be minimized, yet at the
same time allow for connectors and things so one can actually use the damn
thing. To this end, the following rules must be adhered to when you find
yourself needing to move equipment connected to the ethernet (if in doubt,
don't mess with it):

1) The wiring topology ALWAYS must conform to:

	Terminator -----------------terminator

(The "---" indicates ethernet cable).
In our case, one of the terminated ends is in the computer room, so you don't
need to worry about that one. If either of the terminators is removed or the
wire is disconnected such that an end becomes unterminated, the segment will
cease to function. This may also cause other segments (i.e. the entire network
in the building) to stop working for a while. Please don't do this.

2) Taps are allowed in the cable, but no more that 29 (except for those fed
from a twisted-pair, which are confined to 10) AND the tap must connect
directly to the device. The taps we use are BNC T connectors and are known
as invasive taps because they require the wire to be cut in two in order
for them to be installed. I.e.

	Terminator ------T---...----T----terminator
			 d          d
			 v          v
			 c          c

NEVER hookup a device like this:

	Terminator ------T----terminator
			 |
			 |
			 |
			 d
			 v
			 c

The wire connecting the device to the ethernet cable is known as a "stub"
which can cause an impedance mismatch of the worst kind (it can become
a resonant circuit, depending on how long it is). Just say no to stubs.

3) Always assume there are other users on your segment. This is almost always
true in our environment. "Party lines" are used throughout the building.

There are maximum segment length limitations which you probably won't run into
if you are simply rearranging a lab, but you may if you are moving to some
other area of the building. We have some tools to determine and help with
these things.

Subj:	Motor Amp Board


Dennis, this is from my status report:

As a result of a meeting with various people alleged to be involved with the
project, it was discovered that the new higher current thyristors they were 
unable to get were, in fact, SCRs, and would not have worked. 

I have been in contact with Rich Comeau of Motorola. It seems that they
are in the process of making extensive changes to the fabs that make their 
thyristors and, basically, they can't deliver parts until October.

Rich Comeau checked all around and the ONLY Triacs he could find are
MAC223A10s from Future Electronic in Boston. They have 4,000 parts.
(The MAC223A10 is 25 Amps and 800 Volts.) Note, there are no MAC15A6s to be
had.

According to MANMAN we have 141 MAC223A8s in inventory (132004-001). They are
rated for 25 Amps and 600 Volts and were used in the Rump Thump Board.

SGS-Thompson also makes Triacs and someone could check with them if they
wanted to.


Motor Amp, Continued:
--------------------
At 60 Hz a half cycle is 8.33 ms. 

The counter that determines the conduction angle has a maximum length of 
8.19 ms.

At 50 Hz a half cycle is 10 ms. 

Therefore, what would be a low-power cycle at 60 Hz will be 2 ms 
(out of 10 ms) at 50 Hz.

If this needs to be fixed in hardware there are three options:

	1. Change the 1 MHz oscillator oscillator to 830 KHz.

		Not a standard frequency.

	2. Change the Divide Ratio from 64 to 78	[Board Change]

		Requires changing LS393 to GAL16V8.

	3. Change Divide Ratio to 128.			[One Cut, One Jumper]

		Reduces Programmable range from 128 to 78.

Subj:	Motor Driver board.


I just talked with Mark Sherman about some thoughts he has concerning 
the Motor Driver (Numfa) board.

. He requested the use of metal screws (with nylon insulators if 
  necessary) for mounting the Triacs to the heatsinks. He said that 
  the Nylon screws can not be tightened sufficiently, ant that they 
  get damaged too easily.

. Fuse holder mounting. He said that one of the fuseholders arrived 
  in France broken. He thought that the mounting for the fuseholder in 
  the board was not sufficient for the amount of pressure required to 
  get the fuse out of the holder.

. He reiterated the concern about the orientation of the triac 
  heatsinks. The triacs can not be replaced without removing one of 
  the heatsinks completely.

His comments were given for consideration in future designs, and 
where possible for consideration in the existing design.

This is a communication message, not an action request.

                            BIG BASH IS A COMIN'

	As you know, The 20th anniversary Big Bash party fast approaches. It
will be an all-day party-hardy happening. There are many events for everyone
to participate in.  Details will be published soon. We will have tests of
strength, voracity, slight of hand, skill, speed, talent and bad taste.
	One of the main events will be the Talent/No Talent Show. With a cash
prize of $250 dollars for the best routine AND $250 dollars for the worst
act, you'll want to start thinking about your act now.
	First to sign up is Jackie Sherman who feels that no one else can
handle a yo-yo any worse than she can. Rumor has it, that the entire
Marketing Department may be involved in the act. (Dueling yo-yos?) Jackie is
counting on an extra vote for being an expectant mother.
	I heard that Accounting may be getting together to form a juggling act.
(numbers, I think)
	Sign-ups for all the events will be announced next week. Start building
your gut-bucket band now!

Subj:	A dog needs a new home


As you all know, Elaine Shirley is moving to Texas
in June.  There is only one member of the family
who can't go....their beautiful German Sheppard!
Elaine hates to leave him but they don't have a
fence around their new home, so they have to leave
Hobbs behind.  He's almost 2 years old, very happy
and friendly (even to other dogs) and would love
a good home.  The only reason you shouldn't take
this great dog is if you have very small children.
Because he's never been around small children, and
his large size, Elaine doesn't feel comfortable.
But he's great with school age kids (she has two herself).
So if you can find it in your heart to give a
great dog a good home please contact Elaine at 3943
(she'll love you forever!!)

>                                        --Debbie Debs   Rainsalot, CA




> MR. VIDEO GUY RESPONDS:

>     Upon losing millions by the end of 1983, Atari was sold by its
> parent, Warner Communications, and, thus, the Golden Age of video games
> came to an abrupt end.  Supposedly, this "crash" came due to Americans'

> and keen observation of what went wrong the first time around.  This is
> the "truth" according to many, including VG&CE's Arnie "Mr. Video-Gaming
> Know-It-All" Katz.

>     Don't believe any of this for a second, Deb.  This textbook fairy tale
> is the biggest perpetrated lie in video-gaming today.  How could Atari
> Inc., one  of the top American corporations in the early 80's, be deemed a
> financial loser even though its losses didn't come close to overcoming its

> mismanagement is blamed for the video-game giant's demise.  But even if
> this were the case (which is dubious), why didn't Warner execs just ax the

> itself justifies the dismantling of an entire industry?  Look at the
> American auto industry.  I know what you're thinking..."Whoa, Mr. Video
> Guy has gone off the deep end because of his bitterness from not getting a
> promotion where he works."  Yet before you write me off as another
> conspiracy paranoic, ask yourself these questions:

>          (1) Who would've benefited from Atari's death?
>          (2) Who could've pulled it off?
>          (3) Who could've covered it up?  Who?

>     Atari didn't die, Miss Debs.  It was killed -- by NINTENDO.  Some
> facts:  From the late 1970's to early 80's, Atari dominated the coin-op
> scene.  Clearly, the beginning of the video-game industry was not only
> American invented but influenced, too.  The only stride that the Japanese
> made during these times was Space Invaders, but they were still too busy
> hawking pachinko, their lame-o answer to pinball.  Eventually, it was
> clear to the Japanese entertainment industry that America, along with the
> rest of the world, would never be hip to Japanese pop music and Akira
> Kurosawa flicks.  Already the masters of consumer electronic gadgetry.,
> they, naturally, wanted to produce a cultural export.  After all,
> America's most profitable export is its culture, in the form of bad
> movies, dumb TV shows, and tone-deaf pop songs.  How else do you explain
> Jerry Lewis and the French?

>     There was only one avenue left for Japanese entertainment to try
> pervading; video-games.  But one thing stood in their way, Atari. Not eve
> n the American companies Mattel and Coleco could topple Atari's grip. 
> Competing coin-op game makers also failed to break the company's equally
> tight hold in the arcades, among them Sega.  So, you see, Debbie, lots of
> companies on both fronts wanted Atari dead.

>     Let us now SPECULATE the events that might have occurred leading up to
> that tragic day in 1983... 

> * - Japan's #1 cheesy LCD "card" game maker Nintendo (overconfident by the
>     success of their Donkey Kong coin-op and sequels) forms a secret
>     alliance with Japan's #1 coin-op game company Sega (producers of
>     pretty looking but quickly boring-to-play arcade games) to look at the
>     possibility of unseating Atari in the video-game marketplace.  

> * - Atari sells over five million units of Pac-Man for their 2600 unit.  
>     Sears declares the cartridge the second fastest selling item they've
>     ever carried.  Seeing how Atari is so powerful that it can literally
>     slap together an atrociously bad arcade translation and make nearly a
>     billion dollars unsettles the Nintendo/Sega alliance.  Prompted also
>     by the fact that Mattel's superior Intellivision still isn't taking
>     off (despite TV endorsements by boring George Plimpton and what
>     Nintendo/Sega feels is its excellent pad controllers), they decide to
>     back off for now.

> * - (Late 1982)  Nintendo cohorts with Coleco to bring Donkey Kong to the
>     former leather company's new ColecoVision system, and Sega 
>     contributes their equally bland Turbo.  Despite much fanfare and 
>     moderate consumer interest, the system only does slightly better than 
>     mediocre.  The Atari 2600, primitive as it is, still manages to 
>     maintain its majority share in the industry.  The Nintendo/Sega 
>     alliance seems to be going nowhere.

> * - (Middle 1983)  Atari reports losses in the millions since its
>     ownership under Warner Communications.  This is not unusual
>     considering that the early years of the Reagan era were a time of
>     recession for most American businesses.  To bring them out of this
>     slump, Atari has big plans for the 5200 and even bigger ones for the
>     still-on-the-drawing-board 7800, which promises to outperform all
>     video-game systems.

> * - In a desperate move, the Nintendo/Sega alliance makes a deal with
>     Warner Communications:  Sell off the consumer division of Atari to an
>     idiot who would likely run it to the ground.  In return, the alliance
>     would insure that its powerful lobbyists would petition Congressmen to
>     lighten up on antitrust laws barring Warner from acquiring or merging
>     with other media companies.  This should be a cinch to do, considering
>     the Reagan administration's "free trade" and "hands off" policy
>     regarding business.  Executives at Warner, preferring to control one
>     big pie rather than having to worry about several pies, accepts the
>     deal.

> * - (Late 1983) Warner publicly announces the financial losses of Atari 
>     for the year and states misgivings about the video-game business. 
>     Among their statements is that America is tiring of video games.  The
>     mass media jumps on the bandwagon, adding that Atari's games are
>     "blocky looking" and "dinky sounding", too. Atari stock plummets.

> * - Warner announces the sale of Atari's home division to Jack "The Patsy"
>     Tramiel.  Tramiel, the mastermind behind the Commodore Vic-20 fiasco,
>     declares that the new Atari, Atari Corp., will be in the business of
>     selling computers which everyone can afford.  He fails to add,
>     however, that hardly anyone will want them.

> * - Warner retains the coin-op division of Atari, renaming it Atari Games. 
>     Two years later, in keeping to their agreement with the Nintendo/Sega
>     alliance , they sell it for a killing to the Japanese company Namco,
>     the inventors of Pac-Man.

> * - In the same year, Nintendo introduces the NES.  After "careful
>     evaluation of the previous market", they state that the time is right
>     for a new generation of video games.  Among the NES' selling points
>     are Robbie the Robot and its pad controllers, which are essentially
>     improved versions of the Intellivision's.

> * - Having accomplished their mutual goal, Nintendo and Sega cease their
>     alliance.  It's agreed that Sega will stick to the arcade coin-op
>     industry , where it has become #1 after Atari's demise, and stay out
>     of the consumer market.  Likewise, Nintendo promises to concentrate
>     only on home video-gaming and keep out of the arcade scene, except for
>     an occasional, badly produced coin-op such as Super Mario Bros. and
>     Rad Racer that will only be available for play in kiddie "pizza-time
>     theater" restaurants.

> * - Jack Tramiel nearly runs Atari Corp. into the ground, thanks to his
>     purchase of the Federated electronic stores and saying stupid, already
>     known facts such as Apple computers being "too expensive" and IBM
>     systems as "inefficient".

> * - The temptation for Sega is too strong, and so they ally themselves
>     with Tonka Toys and jointly enter the home market with the Sega Master
>     System, sparking a blood feud with their former ally that continues to
>     this day.  This venture fails, but Sega is even more determined to "do
>     it all".

> * - (1988)  Warner Communications merges with Time Inc., forming the Time
>     Warner company.  The new company acquires controlling interest in
>     Atlantic Records.  Time Warner is responsible for the Batman motion
>     picture and its inevitable, upcoming sequels.

> * - In the January 9th, 1992 issue of Rolling Stone (with Michael Jackson
>     on the cover trying to look like a man) there's an article on Sigeru
>     Miyamoto, the twisted genius behind Nintendo's "Mario" games.  David
>     Sheff writes, "...Japanese software, such as books, movies and
>     recordings, has had little impact outside Japan.  The exception is
>     video games.  One Japanese writer. ..has noted that Nintendo is
>     Japan's largest cultural export, 'bigger than Akira Kurosawa.'"

>     Ever wondered how Nintendo got off so easily in their recent court
> settlement with California's Attorney General?  Killing off Atari was by
> no means easy for Nintendo, but they did it.  Thus, having their sentence
> reduced to a paltry $5 rebate plan couldn't have been that difficult for
> them to do.  And look at their past court cases against Tengen, the home
> division of Atari Games, and their attempts to acquire the Seattle
> Mariners.

>     Also, why has Sega -- like their trademark mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog 
> been such an annoying, arrogant pest to Nintendo?  Because they're
> aggressive competitors?  Right.  They're still resentful over their former
> pact because they felt they got the raw end of the deal.

>     The one thing that didn't go as planned for Nintendo and Sega was that
> Atari didn't die completely.  Today, Atari Corp. would probably be
> nonexistant if it weren't for the Lynx, originally designed by Epyx, which
> has turned out to be their lifesaver for the time being.  Otherwise, the
> Nintendo/Sega alliance pulled off the perfect coup.  Software support has
> always been a problem for Atari Corp.'s hardware since the company doesn't
> have the resources of an arcade division.  "Divide and conquer" as the
> saying goes.

>     I'm not the only one who knows of this insidious plot.  I suspect that
> Arnie Katz and the Game "Bill Kunkel" Doctor know it as well, have known
> about it all along, and are keeping mum.  However, I doubt they're doing
> this because they're covering up for Nintendo and Sega.  Rather, they
> might've been warned to keep their mouths shut by the perpetrators.  You
> have to remember that in the latter years of Electronic Games (just before
> the magazine was retitled Computer Entertainment), Katz and the Doc were
> mysteriously absent from its pages, for reasons they care not to
> elaborate.  Had they discovered the truth and already knew of Nintendo's
> plans as early as 1984?

>     I'll bet Steve "Arnie Katz Lookalike-and-Wannabee" Harris of
> Electronic Gaming Monthly knows a lot about all of this, too.  His
> magazine has been bankrolled by Japanese investment from the very start
> (when it was originally Electronic Game Player).  Ever noticed how Harris
> and Quarterman are a lot like Katz and the Doc in terms of concept, though
> radically different in style?  I doubt this is coincidence rather than by
> design.

>     Another whom I believe knows a lot more than he's willing to tell is
> Howard "TV Weatherman Dress-Alike" Phillips, the former Nintendo
> spokesperson who left his position for a conspiciously ambiguous role with
> Lucasfilm Games.  Did he learn the truth, too, and decide to get out for
> his own safety, thus, depriving Nester someone to be a sidekick for?  A
> while ago, I got a phone call from someone who sounded suspiciously
> familiar:

>     "V-Video Guy!  Listen -- you've got to get out!  You're way over your
>     head!"

>     "Who is this?  Howard??  Is this Howard Phillips?!"

>     "Didn't you read the ***damn business section today??  They got the
>     ****ing California Attorney General?!  The ****ing Attorney General of
>     California!!  Not even Larry Flynt's ****ing lawyers can protect you! 
>     I'm warning you as a colleague -- just drop it if you know what's
>     ***damn ****ing good for you!!"

>     Well, I'm not going to drop it, Howard (or whoever you are).  The
> assassination of Atari was the single most horrible event for an entire
> generation of video-gaming.  It tore the heart out from what promised to
> be a new age of electronic entertainment - - never mind that it had

> relevant papers that are locked away in some big government building
> sort-of-place are released so that the video-gaming public can decide for
> themselves what really happened on that fateful day in 1983.

>     So there you have it, Debbie.  The TRUTH.  Now you know why

Subj:	Put Your Voice in It.


For those of you who haven't yet seen it, the "Put Your Voice in It" demo board
is in the common area.

This device consists of one chip and its support of battery, Microphone,
speaker and few switches and caps.  I have put it all behind and in a handy
dandy piece of wood, so that you all can have a look and listen to its
capabilities.  So if you can, please stop by the common area and have a few
words with the device.

It can sample 16 seconds of sound at 8192 samples per second and can easily be
microprocessor controlled.

If you have any ideas as to how Atari can use the chip in future products,
please write your comments in the supplied notebook or write me mail.

Thanks

Brian

On previous games that used ASIC65s (now called P15s) the project team
would give me an EPROM containing the P15 program and I would verify that it
included the information required by the Margolin OutaSite Programmer to 
correctly report information in Self-Test. I would program a part and they 
would verify that it worked correctly in the game.

I have been left out of the loop on Guardians so I regret that Erik and I 
cannot help you.

I am advised that Jim Freitas has the responsibility for having the part
programmed. (I recommend that the part be programmed either on Jim Freitas'
Data I/O 2900 or on Pat McCarthy's Data I/O Unisite.)

With all the recent talk about creativity, here is your chance to shine!

As part of the 20th Anniversary celebration, we will be holding a sculpture
contest.  All contestants will be given the same materials and asked to 
create something.  Something can be functional, whimsical, artistic,
useful - anything you want it to be.  We will have a sign-up sheet in the
Main Lobby and on Monday, June 8, all those who have signed up will be
given their own personal sack of artistic supplies.  Included will be 
some very basic ground rules (i.e., you can add nothing besides bonding
material - glue, nails, tape, etc and paint).

It should be real interesting to see what people come up with given the
same starting materials - CREATIVITY is the real name of this game.

Stop by the Main Lobby and sign up.  While you are in the neighborhood,
don't forget to sign up for the Talent, No-Talent contest  -  Rumor has
it that David Pasquinelli is considering a fine tuned display of mail
sorting to the soothing, rock-y twang of ZZ Top.

The purpose of this "meeting" will be for US to talk and management to listen
to concrete ideas on how we (meaning management and peons) can create a 
creative environment at Atari. I will be the moderater; we will, hopefully,
deal in realistic and specific plans which will be implemented, kvetching
(e.g. I can't get anything done because everybody hates me etc.) and
schmickeling (e.g. I just think management is doing a wonderful job and this
is the best of all possible managers etc.) will be promptly censured. Please
RSVP me as soon as possible so that I can get an idea of wiether we can
all fit into the room.

Don joined Atari in 1988 and immediately became a significant contributor
to the music in our products.  Don received his Doctor of Music in Composition
with Distinction from Indiana University in 1986.  We all know Don's work from
his unique contribution to Atari Audio.  But did you know that Don has composed
many musical pieces for a variety of ensembles and instruments; from Vocal,
Pop and Electronic Music to Chamber and Orchestral pieces?

I'm honored to be working with Don and enjoy learning from his vast knowledge
of music.  I look forward to seeing how Don will help us shape the signature of
the Atari Sound!

                               Great work Don!

	Yeh, well I finally found those missing handtrucks (BOTH of them).
I again heard someone was looking for them (they hadn't been returned yet),
and being a person who knows how frustrating it is not being able to locate at
least ONE of them (We have two, plenty to go around). So I decide to
investigate. I searched the entire company until I finally came across BOTH of
them sitting in TENGENs common area (unattended). I guess the last user just
figured the finders-keepers rule applied. I guess the last user just figured 
their job was done. However, they were Incorrect. These handtrucks are of major
importance to all of us and so it is rather important that they be returned to
where they belong when not in use. That way, whoever needs them can use them
when necessary. It's really simple. This rule even is extended to the person
or persons that violated that premise in this case. However, if this is not
acceptable, I urge those persons to please purchase thier own, and leave ours
to our use. They are only $189 (plus tax & license). Its not much, and I'm sure
your boss would be happy to cough up the dough. OR, you can go ahead and use
ours. All you have to do is BRING THEM BACK TO WHERE YOU FOUND THEM WHEN
YOUR DONE.

Subj:	Sculpture contest


The sculpture contest is really heating up! I have had many questions 
about it, so let me see if I can answer everyone at once.

Everyone will get a box of materials to use. I am going to try to get them
all put together by next week. You don't have to make the sculpture on the 
spot at the party. You should have a couple of weeks to work on this at
home or where ever. You don't have to use everything in the box. You can
widdle just on stick and leave it at that if you want. The only thing
you can't do is to use your own materials. You can add adhesives and
paint, varnish, laquer. (Ooops, look up there, I typed "on stick". Of
course I meant "one stick")
	The sky is the limit. Grind up everything in the box and glom
it back together with glue to make a free form. Glue everything together
and turn it on a lathe into a lamp base. I don't care! The wilder the better.
	I had set the limit at 20 participants, but if you sign up by early 
next week, I'll make as many boxes as we have contestants.

	And don't forget that you can use your creative juices to design
a kite. We need more stupid people tricks for the No Talent Show. And
hoops, and rc cars, and voleyball, and hoola hoops, and ping pong, and
ice hockey, and ...............

FIELD TEST CABINETS. ALL IS NOT LOST!!! I KNOW WHAT THE FIX IS, AND I HAVE
A GOOD FEELING FOR WHICH MFG DATE CODE WILL HAVE THE BAD DIODES. SO, AND THIS
IS FOR THE TECHS OUT THERE, IF YOU WANT TO CHECK TO SEE IF YOU HAVE A FAULTY
DISPLAY LOOK AT THE PLATE THAT THE MAIN PCB MOUNTS TO ON THE CHASSIS. ON THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE, (LOOKING FROM THE REAR OF THE DISPLAY), YOU WILL SEE A FEW 
LABELS, ONE OF WHICH WILL HAVE THE MONTH AND YEAR OF MANUFACTURE. ANYTHING 
BUILT BEFORE OCTOBER 91 WILL NO DOUBT HAVE THE BAD DIODE. NOW HERE'S THE NEAT
PART. IF YOUR DISPLAY WAS BUILT BEFORE OCTOBER 91, ALL YA GOTTA DO IS CALL ME 
AND I'LL DROP EVERYTHING AND RACE OVER TO INSTALL THE CORRECT DIODE. AS AN
ADDED BONUS, I CAN MAKE THE CHANGE WITHOUT REMOVING THE DISPLAY FROM THE
CABINET, (AT LEAST ON THE GAMES I HAVE HAD TO FIX TO DATE). THE INCENTIVE TO
CHECK OUT YOUR DISPLAY PRIOR TO FIELD TEST IS SIMPLE, I DON'T DO ROAD CALLS. 
AND I CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH FUN IT IS TO CHANGE A DISPLAY IN AN ARCADE.

	Four Point Entertainment, the company that produces the syndicated
TV hit "American Gladiators," plans to launch "Cowboys" in fall 1993.
"We are creating a high-tech western setting with several virtual reality
games," said Four Point president Ron Ziskin.  "It will include elaborate
electronics and almost a virtual reality shootout event."
	It will also have traditional rodeo events, such as roping and 
riding contests, but with new twists.  One event will involve contestants
being "roped" by cowboys and cowgirls.

Subj:	MUlt-synce II PCB's


Karen is out sick today. She explained that many people have asked her
about Multi-sync II PCB's built in January 1992.

KAREN REPORTS THAT PROTO-ASSY HAS:
		(5) BLANK Multi-Sync II PCB's
	        (1) partially stuffed Multi-sync II

Apparently there were as many as 25 Blanks PCB's (see attached message).
Karen has not kept track of these 25 PCB's nor do I feel it is her 
responsibility to do so.

     Jed and I have discussed the surface mount issue with Fine Pitch.
  They are aware that the VRAMs are small outline J leads, 40 pin, with
  50 mil centers, and are due to Atari Games @ Jan 2.  I told them I 
  would try to get the boards and VRAMs to them on Monday, Jan. 6. I 
  also told them that a 5 day turnaround would suffice, which means that
  if all goes well Karen would have the assembled surface mount boards
  on @ Jan. 10 (Friday) or Jan. 13 (Monday).  
     Please be aware of the shortages to Karen's kit for 25 boards as
  listed above.  I am changing all quantities per on the kit to reflect
  only the amount I have available in our stockroom, so that no shortages
  will be created on the production shortage report.  Obtaining the
  above parts for successful completion of said 25 boards is now in the
  hands of our engineering group (Unless, of course, I am directed to 
  do otherwise by Mr. Stewart and/or Mr. Smith).
    I should have this kit pulled by Thursday morning of this week.
  Is it Karen I should call when the kit is available?
    Please get back to me soon if there are any changes, questions or
  comments pertaining to this scenario.  Thank you.

Subj:	Those Handtrucks (once and for all?)


This is to just clarify that the hand trucks left in the Tengen Common
area were left there by an Atari employee.  This person was obviously
in too much of a hurry to complete a job they started, theyforgot to follow
up on any of it, leaving the handtrucks and the rest of their equipment
for someone else to take care of.  It would seem a rule that we should
have all learned in our early childhood applies here; "Always pick up
after yourself, and put things back where you got them from!".  I'm
sorry for the inconvience that this may have caused folks on all sides,
and hope that something has been learned by all of this.

There will be another brown bag lunch this thursday, same time (noon),
same place (eng conf room). Last meeting we discussed those factors which
foster and inhibit creativity. We came to the following conclusions:

FOSTER:

        1. Communication
                both within the company and with the outside world

        2. Solutions, not Problems
                think of reasons why it will work, not why it won't

        3. Positive Feedback
                atta-boys (sexist), management involvement

INHIBIT:

        1. Inbreeding, NIH
                the assumption that we know it all and best

        2. Problems, not Solutions

        3. Monkey See/Monkey Do, Knee Jerk management
                reacting to the current marketplace instead of innovating
                for the future, short range planning

        4. Cubicals
                FEH!

        5. Feudal Society
                operating as a loose confederation as opposed to a single
                company


We also felt that the fault was not in our not being creative enough or
not working hard enough, but rather the system in which we toil. To that
end each person attending this weeks meeting is ask to bring at least
one suggestion as to how they would change the current system to make it
more responsive to our needs

Howdy!

Does anyone out there know how to use Word 4.0 on an Apple Computer hooked up
to a QMS laserprinter to print an envelope?

I have created the envelope file in landscape orientation using standard fonts,
and everything looks fine on the screen, but when I select print preview from
the file menu, all that shows up is a blank sheet of paper.  Additionally,
when I select print from the file menu, the printer processes the file and 
ejects a blank sheet (or blank envelope).

What do I need to do instead?

Thanks!

Subj:	Atari's Future:  Problem 1


	A few of us have been having chats in the hallways, offices and
conference rooms lately about the state of Atari Games.  These have ranged from
informal coffee station conversations to formal meetings about issues that
affect us all.  The topics seem to be as diverse as the locations, but all seem
to revolve around the general issue of Atari's 'SYSTEM'.  That is: how we do
business inside (how we have organized ourselves, management style, employees,
environmental constraints, etc.) and how we do business on the outside (how we
interface with our customers and the rest of the world, taxes, etc.).

        Many feel that we are in need of some changes.  But what changes? 

	A few of us feel that we should begin the process of describing what we
see as inefficient and unproductive and offering solutions for better
productivity and higher quality.  And so, we offer this new type of forum to
view ideas on specific important areas.  This message is the first of many to
follow.  And here is how it will work:

        Each week I will offer a problem relevant to Atari Games and a solution
by top management consultants.  What I am asking you to do is to respond to me
(via EMAIL) on how Atari Games compares to this solution.  I will collect all
responses, edit them and then EMAIL them back to you the next week.  After you
have had a chance to read the edited replys, I would like you to reply once
again on how Atari Games can close the gap between the Atari Games way and the
consultant's method.

        It's important that you only reply directly to me, since a general
free-for-all will most likely defocus the issue at hand.  And, by the way, take
some time with your replys.  These will be important issues.  Considering
Atari's long term survivial, this is more important then your current project!

And now this weeks problem:

What do you think is the purpose of Atari Games?  What is the goal of this
company?

Some things to ponder from a top management consultant:

	A company should create constancy of purpose toward improvement of
product with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business and to
provide jobs.  (constancy is defined as:  the state or quality of being
unchanging; stability).

        There are two problems:  1) problems of today and 2) problems of
tomorrow.  Problems of today encompass maintenance of quality of product put out
today, regulation of output so as not to exceed immediate sales by too far,
budget, employment, profits, sales, service, public relations, forecasting, and
so forth.  It is easy to stay bound up in the tangled knot of the problems of
today, becoming ever more and more efficient in them.

        Problems of the future command first and foremost constancy of purpose
and dedication to improvement of competitive position to keep the company alive
and to provide jobs for their employees.  Are the board of directors and the
president dedicated to quick profits, or to the institution of constancy of
purpose?  The next quarterly dividend is not as important as existence of the
company 10, 20, or 30 years from now.  Establishment of constancy of purpose
means acceptance of obligations like the following:

I. Innovate.  Allocate the resources for long-term planning.  Plans for the
future call for consideration of:

        New product that may help people to live better materially,
	 and that will have a market
        New materials that will be required and the probable cost
        Method of production; possible changes in equipment for production
        New skills required, and in what number?
        Training and retraining of personnel
        Training of supervisors
        Cost of production
        Cost of marketing; plans for service; cost of service
        Performance in the hands of the user
        Satisfaction of the user

	One requirement for innovation is faith that there will be a future. 
Innovation, the foundation of the future, can not thrive unless the top
management have declared unshakable commitment to quality and productivity. 
Until this policy can be enthroned as an institution, middle management and
everyone else in the company will be skeptical about the effectiveness of their
best efforts.

II. Put resources into Research and Education

III. Constantly improve design of product and service.  This obligation never
ceases.  The consumer (NOT our distributors but our players and users) is the
most important part of the production line.  

	It is a mistake to suppose that efficient production of product
	and service can with certainty keep an organization solvent and ahead
	of competition.  It is possible and in fact fairly easy for an
	organization to go downhill and out of business making the wrong
	product or offering the wrong service, even though everyone in the
	organization performs with devotion, employing statistical methods
	and every other aid that can boost efficiency.

Our customers, our suppliers, and employees need the company's constancy of
purpose - our intention to stay in business by providing product and service
that will help man to live better and which will have a market.

Top management should publish a resolution that no one will lose his job for
contribution to quality and productivity.


Questions:
1. Has ATARI Games established a constancy of purpose?
2. If yes, what is the purpose?  If no, what are the obstacles?
3. Will this stated purpose stay fixed, or will it change with time?
4. Do all employees know about this stated constancy of purpose?
5. How many believe it to the extent that it affects their work?
6. Who does our president answer to?  Who do our board of directors answer to?


Remember to reply directly to me.  Next week you will receive the replys and be
presented with the next problem and solution.

Subj:	Updates to the Updates


Ok, The sculpture design materials have been distributed. Go to it!
Helpful hint #1 - Don't be boxed in; use all your resources.
Helpful Hint #2 - One could theoretically make paper mache' starch
	          from a bagel.
Helpful Hint #3 - Nails and staples count as adhesive materials.

Looks like the kite design contest is gonna fly.

Rc Car Race - People are beginning to practice zoomin'. Cars are
not provided. (I guess there was some misunderstanding) You have
your own. Borrowing is always an option.

The No Talent show is shaping up. Rob and Mike as Murphy Brown and
Dan Quayle???????

Even though there are sign-ups for Volleyball and RC Cars and ping-pong
doesn't mean you have to compete to join in. All of those things and
many others will be available throughout the day. All you have to do
is have fun.

Please have fun....it's my job.......

TTFN, Carole

Subj:	"Name That Thang" Contest Winner


************* CONGRATULATIONS!!! ****************

Dave Pasquinelli is the winner of the "Name That Thang" contest.

Simulation Products received scores of innovative, hilarious,
disgusting and creative suggestions for a product name for the
advanced driving simulator being developed.

("C.O.P.-ulator" is not the winner...)

Dave Pasquinelli's initial suggestion, sent to us on the first
day of the contest, was ST-1000, for "Safety Trainer" or "Simulation
Trainer 1000".  The name selection committee went through the huge
list of suggestions, and Dave's concept was adopted and adapted and mixed
with Eric Aker's idea ("Sim-Vee") to create a list of "family" designations 
for all the models of the driving simulators.

Thus, the basic 5-screen law enforcement driver training simulator
will be known as the *** SV5000LE *** for Simulation Vehicle, 5-screen,
Law Enforcement. A 3-screen simulator for general education driver training
will be known as an *** SV3000GT ***

Once again, thanks Dave for your suggestion, and you are the proud recipient
of a twenty-five dollar gift certificate.  Please see Larry Graves and shake
him down for it.

                     BORLAND SHIPS FIVE LANGUAGE PRODUCTS
       Multi-Platform Language Products For Programmers At All Levels

NEW YORK - June 2, 1992 - Borland International Inc. (NASDAQ:BORL) today
announced the availability of five new multi-platform language releases. The
new object-oriented products -- Borland C++ & Application Frameworks 3.1,
Borland C++ 3.1, Turbo C++ for Windows 3.1, and Turbo Pascal for Windows
1.5 -- take advantage of the advanced features of Microsoft Windows 3.1. 
Borland also introduced a new member to its award-winning ObjectVision
product line, ObjectVision 2.0 for OS/2.

"These new Language products cement Borland's leadership in object-oriented
technology for DOS, Windows and OS/2," said Gene Wang, vice president and
general manager of Borland's Languages Business Unit. "From Borland C++ and
Turbo Pascal for Windows to ObjectVision, Borland provides solutions for a
broad range of development needs across multiple platforms."

The new releases add significant features to Borland's C++ and Turbo Pascal
for Windows product lines, including:

   *  Full Windows 3.1 and 3.0 support
   *  Color Syntax highlighting
   *  New Windows documentation

Borland C++ & Application Frameworks 3.1 and Borland C++ 3.1

Borland C++ 3.1 is a complete development system for professional programmers
who program in C or C++.  Borland C++ & Application Frameworks 3.1 includes
all of Borland C++ 3.1 including the ObjectWindows and Turbo Vision
application frameworks, the Runtime Library source code and the Windows API
reference manual.

Other new features

   *  Strict C++ compliance
   *  An optimizing Windows-hosted development environment
   *  New global optimizations for C++ and 386 code generation
   *  WinSpector - A new utility for determining the causes of UAEs
   *  Integrated resource compilation

Turbo C++ for Windows 3.1

Turbo C++ for Windows 3.1 offers an inexpensive route to Windows programming
for entry level C and C++ users.  Turbo C++ for Windows 3.1 includes the
basic tools necessary for creating Windows applications, but does not include
the professional tool set, the optimizing compiler, or the library source
code.

Turbo Pascal for Windows 1.5

Turbo Pascal for Windows 1.5 is a high-productivity application development
system used by VARs, consultants and educators.  Borland has sold more than
two million copies of Pascal worldwide.

Turbo Pascal for Windows 1.5 now lets users take full advantage of the new
features in Microsoft Windows 3.1, which include OLE, common dialogs, drag &
drop, and Truetype fonts.

New Features in Turbo Pascal for Windows 1.5

   *  Resource Workshop - Borland's powerful graphical design tool which
      enables users to visually create professional-looking user interfaces
      with Borland's Custom Controls.  Resource Workshop replaces the
      Whitewater Resource Toolkit delivered with previous versions.

   *  Speedbar - Provides programmers with quick access to many common
      functions

   *  Turbo Debugger for Windows 3.0 with Super VGA support

ObjectVision 2.0 for OS/2

ObjectVision is an easy way for programmers and non-programmers to create
business applications for both Windows and OS/2 2.0. ObjectVision will offer
the same fundamental functionality and features on OS/2 2.0 as those
introduced on Windows.  These include the ease of use features as well as
provisions for all three aspects of application creation: application
interface, business rules or application logic, and connection to databases
and other applications.

ObjectVision 2.0 for OS/2 features

ObjectVision 2.0 for OS/2 includes all of the features in the ObjectVision
2.0 for Windows version, but with significant enhancements that exploit the
OS/2 2.0 operating system.  These features include:

   *  Full 32-bit implementation
   *  Multi-threading via the multiple thread process model
   *  Integrated support of OS/2 Database Manager through IBM's
      optional Extended Services Capability
   *  Interface to the REXX programming language

ObjectVision 2.0 for OS/2 will also exploit the Presentation Manager user
interface and the high performance OS/2 2.0 file system.

Attention modem-owners-to-be:

	Recently I heard some of you are interested in getting modems.

	Yesterday I found a very good bargain for a 2400-baud internal
	modem for IBM PC's and compatibles.  A new office supply chain 
	has opened 6 stores in the Bay Area.  As part of their two day
	Grand Opening, BizMart is offering these modems along with ProComm
	driver software for less than 1 cent per baud.

	This $19.99 special lasts only until 9:00 PM today.

	The closest BizMart is at the southeast corner of El Camino and 
	Kiely in Santa Clara.  Other BizMarts are located at the Fremont Hub
	and at 1501 Broadway in Redwood City.

Yours truly,
Glenn Mandelkern

the parking lot behind 675 and be patient, it will take 30 to 45 minutes
to get everyone arranged and finally snap the shutter.  Rob Rowe will be
video-taping the set up of Erik's photo.  It would be fun to see a sea of

We have several new people that have not been told, and several 
old people that need a reminder.....

@sys$mail:everybody  is reserved for official company business 
like new hires, building closures, company announcements, etc. 
As it's name implies, it goes to EVERYBODY.

@sys$mail:junk       is used for other items of interest that 
you want to pass on to ALMOST everybody. This list does not 
include those people who do not like getting junk mail. It can 
be used to send notices of interesting conferences, items for 
sale, interesting ideas, etc. When in doubt, use this one (you 
will rarely need to use the first one).

While I am at it, if you use the POST command from VMS (instead 
of the SEND command from MAIL), the VAX will run the job in the 
background, avoiding bringing your VAX to it's knees.

Thanks!

Subj:	Volleyball


Atari has a coed team in the Industrial Volleyball League. There is room on
the roster for one more male and one more female player.

If you fancy playing in a league on tuesday nights at Del Mar High School
(near Hamilton and Bascom), send vaxmail to Rhonda Allen (user RHONDA) to
arrange for a tryout.

This team usually makes the playoffs and we took first place a couple of
seasons ago so you will need to demonstrate some skill to qualify for the
team. The IVL has some (aribtrary and somewhat confining) rules that must be
adheared to such as no attacking the serve, first ball must be bumped and sets
must be reasonably "clean". We typically play 4-2 offense and always
center-back defense. We'd like to play 6-2 offense and if and when we all can
consistantly pass well, we will use it.

If you know what all this means, then by all means contact Rhonda ASAP (first
game night is 6/16).

If you DON'T know what any of this means, then you probably shouldn't apply.
But don't give up! If you really are interested in joining the team (or any
team), but don't quite have the necessary skills, I suggest you sign up for
one of the night classes at SJCC (good) or DeAnza (better) or any other place
that offers such a program. They will teach you all you need to know in a few
short weeks. It's a lot of fun too.

If you want a chance to polish your skills, or just want to see how well you
would play at the IVL level we play (B2), come on out for some drop in ball at
Oakmeadow in Vasona Park this saturday (6/13) starting about noon. This is
just friendly play; nobody's out for blood, but there is little or no patience
for absolute rooky play or jungleball. Generally play continues until either
it gets too dark, there're not enough people left to make two teams or all
those who remain drop dead from exhaustion.

There is usually two nets setup, one for doubles and the other for regular
play. Most of us hope for enough people to show up to make up 5 or 6 person
teams and at various times during the afternoon, there usually are. You would
be well advised to bring something to drink, a chair, an umbrella, etc.
Oakmeadow is the grassy area in the southwest corner of Vasona Park located at
the corner of Blossom Hill and University in Los Gatos.

See you there...

	I've been trying very hard to be eternally upbeat to rally everyone's
interest in the upcoming 20th anniversary party. But, I'm getting pretty
worn down and I know you-all probably want to avoid me in the halls by this
point. The day of reckoning is here, however.
	The Stupid People Tricks/Talent/No Talent/Gong Show can really be
enormous fun. (Like way total fun) We need more people to get involved. I
know there are a lot of people who told me they were thinking about
participating. Just sign-up in the book at the front lobby. You don't need
to write down exactly what you want to do; maybe you are not sure yet. Just
sign up and wing it!
	It doesn't have to be complicated. Read your favorite poem. Maybe you
know a great bird call. Remember, an equally large purse goes to the WORSE
act.
	We need to have a head count to plan for. Also, if you sign up now, we
can work on having your act's specific needs being met.
	Soooooo, sign up today!!!!  With everybody getting into the spirit
(spirits will be provided) of the event, this can really be a bash.....THIS
CAN BE A BIG BASH !!!!

	    If you have the flue and feel like watching movies till you
	get well, this one's ranks up there with the afternoon soaps.
	The star cast and comic rhythm of this one will keep you awake. 
	

JFK	    Didn't you find the second half of the movie pointless?  
	It didn't offer anything it didn't already show us in the first
	half and the court room scene put me to sleep.
	A condensed version would make sense for those who already
	know their history.

Subj:	TIME WARNER TOUR


The meeting and tour which was conducted with the AD HOC
(Time Warner subsidiary companies Management Committee)
was completed extremely successfully yesterday.

The people who went around Atari/Tengen were very much
impressed with our high level of technology, the well-
organized and functional facility and also with the
good viable people of the company.  I thank you very
much for all the cooperation you have rendered to make
this meeting/tour successful.

Thank you very much,
Hide Nakajima

Subj:	Atari's Future: Problem 1 replys


	Thanks to all for your replys to last week's Problem 1!  Response
was good!

The following contains the edited replys to Problem 1.
To recap, last week's problem was:
	
	"What is the purpose of Atari Games?  What goal has Atari set for
itself?"

	
The replys were varied but the major theme from the respondents was:
	
		"We don't know Atari's purpose."

	One employee cited that "constancy of purpose means directions,
leadership and sticking to it."  But most found that management has not made 
company directions and goals known.  And that management was not aware that it
is crucial to communicate these goals.  Some cited that they felt top 
management probably had no goals. One employee said that "it is apparent that
top management has no concept of the word 'leadership' and how it applies
to running our corporation."

	Several respondents emphatically stated that even though the company
publicly states (in meetings and company gatherings) that innovation and
creativity is very important for the future success of Atari, little (or
nothing) is done to incorporate this into our system.  One respondent: "There is
a lot of lip service paid to the notions of orginality and innovation...  But in
reality, these do not seem to be part of Atari's purpose."

	One reply mentioned that the existence of a Mission Statement is
not as critical as the content.  It was also stated that it was important
that management review company goals critically to define 'real-life,
precise statements for all to follow.

	Others seemed to be outright frustrated with the current system saying:
"my lifelong career is now just a job" and "We are not trying to drive our
chosen industry, it drives us.  The fact that we started the industry is
irrelevant."

	Even though the respondents were frustated, they felt that the
opportunity to turn things around was at hand.  They all seemed willing
to do what it takes, and all said that they look to upper management for
directions.

	And now to follow up Problem 1:

		How can we close the gap?  That is:  What can Atari do
to create a purpose and stick to it?

Subj:	Results of Monday's TW meeting and tour


	I want to thank all of you for your efforts in preparing for
the visit by the Time Warner representatives on Monday.  The office
and lab areas were impressively clean and organized.  The tour lasted
approximately two hours and visited almost all of our design areas.
Moto Frenzy served as a representative project that was used to tie
the various design processes together.  Thus, the ID area had
concept drawings and a deluxe unit, PCB design had a GX2 hardware
schematic and Moto Frenzy board set for illustration, and the tour
visited the Moto Frenzy lab.

	The group that visited is called the "TWI AD HOC COMMITTEE":
TWI stands for Time Warner Inc.  This group meets generally on a
quarterly basis at a different company each session, either a 
company within the Time Warner organization, or a company with a
key technology that has ramifications for the entertainment or
media businesses of Time Warner.  The reason for having the
meeting at Atari Games was for both the technology and organizational
aspects.  In addition, the Ad Hoc committee had their general
meeting in the afternoon to report on current items, June '92
Consumer Electronics Show (CES), status of HDTV, and Cable TV
technologies, particularly the evolution to digital TV transmission.

	The Ad Hoc committee was founded to provide a forum for
communicating and evaluating the technologies within the TWI
organization, as well as developing contacts that will promote
partnerships within the organization to improve individual and
overall corporate success.  As a result of this meeting, we now
have several contacts with Warner Music, CD Manufacturing, and
CD development groups that will be beneficial.  I will be
discussing more about these particular contacts with specific
design groups, and teams.  But if you have an interest in
following up sooner, let me know.

	To illustrate the breadth of the group, representatives
of Warner Bros., American Television & Communications, Time
Warner corporate, Time Warner Telecommunications, Warner Cable,
Warner Special Products, WB Records, Warner Home Video, WEA
Manufacturing, HBO, and Time publishing participate in the
Ad Hoc group.

	As Mr. Nakijima reported, the group was very interested
in the products, technologies, and design capabilities of
Atari Games.  I would count on some new opportunities to
promote, distribute, or improve our products based on this initial
event.

	Once again, thanks for your time and efforts in completing
this successful meeting.

Subj:	One ringy dingy...snort


I thought it would be a good idea to spell out exactly why the phones were
dead before rumors ran rampant and someone looses their head. Besides, it's a
always nice to give credit where credit is due.

PacBell pulled the plug on us. To their credit, they did say, "oops". If you
are curious about the how and why, here's some (lengthy) details. If not, then
type D now...

Our telephone system is connected to the world through three T1 links. Each T1
link handles 24 channels of digitized voice. Physically a T1 link consists of
2 twisted pair and is indistinguishable from two plain ordinary analog
telephone lines (the kind that you use in your house). Telephone service
people (PacBell) are supposed to mark "special" circuits, like T1 links, with
tags and/or red plastic buttons where  these circuits appear in underground
and overhead connection blocks. They don't always do that and they don't
always pay attention to the markings even if they are there.

You may have noticed the PacBell trucks and personnel working along Montague,
McCarthy, Sycamore and Barber Lane over the last few days. They are installing
fiberoptic cable and Milpitas is upgrading the equipment in their "central
office" (CO). Somewhere in the miriad of streets, cables, poles and connection
panels, a technician took it upon his/herself to disconnect a few wires
(probably to move them to a different location). I can imagine they were
thinking "it's only 2 wires, nobody will notice." In our case, we lost 24
connections on each of the three T1's that were disconnected.

One would think that if a circuit were disconnected for a few seconds then
reconnected, we might see a hiccup in service but it shouldn't shut down the
phones for good. I expect that if PacBell had modern equipment this indeed
would be the case. They don't, so it isn't. The CO isn't smart enough to
recognise that a T1 line has 24 channels on it so it treats a T1 as 24
separate and independent circuits. If the CO trys to route a call to a circuit
(or one of the T1's 24 channels) and can't get through because of errors, it
will disable that circuit and try a different one. If our telephone system is
down or the T1 circuits are down, one incoming phone call will cause the CO to
try all available circuts (therefore all 24 channels on the T1) and disable
each one in turn, all within a few seconds. Likewise, it disables our
outgoing trunks if there are too many errors detected.

Neither is the CO equipment smart enough to recognise that a circuit has been
re-established. There is all kinds of signalling on a T1 line to indicate
quality of service and the receiving equipment at the CO certainly knows the
line is up or down, it just doesn't notify the call routing equipment. I
suspect that the antique call router is not able to accept this kind of info
from other signalling devices. This means that when a circuit is disabled, it
can only be renabled by a tech at PacBell. So, we have to call them to tell
them that our lines are down and they have to figure out who we are, where our
lines are, how to test them then how to turn them back on. This usually takes
an hour but may take longer depending on who is working at the CO and whether
or not they know what they are doing.

Is this an isolated incident? Nope. Has it ever happened before? I don't think
the trunk lines were severed before, but the CO has frequently disabled our
DID's and outgoing trunk lines because either the ROLM acted up or the power
in the building was interrupted for more than a few seconds. Will it happen
again? You can count on it. Is there something we can do about it? Yep, switch
service from PacBell to one of the other dozen or so local telephone companies
available in our area :).

Subj:	Atari's Future: Problem 2


A top management consultant states:

	"American style of management rode along unchallenged between 1950
and 1968, when American-manufactured products held the market.  Anyone 
anywhere in the world was lucky for the privilege to buy an American
product.  By 1968, forces of competition could no longer be ignored.  What
had happened in Japan could have happened in America, but did not.  The
thought still lingers:  'We must have been doing something right.'  This
is not an inevitable conclusion."

Here's problem 2:

	"If Atari changes (or creates) a purpose, how can we adopt the
new philosophy?"

The same consultant writes:

	"We are in a new ecomonic age, created by Japan.  Management must
awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take
on leadership for change."

Consider these points:

	Once a company purpose is created, it is vitally important that all
employees accept the responsibility to adopt the new philosophy.  Citing that
"our problems are different" is a common disease that afflicts management and
administration the world over.  We definitely are different, but the principles
that will help to improve the quality of our products are universal in nature
(quality means the usefulness which improves the customer's quality of
life). The management must put resources into this new philosophy, with
commitment to quality, education/training, and leadership.


"How do you think Atari could best adopt new philosophies?"

      Hello, Jed.  If the "Trainer" team wants me to build up 27
   prototype Multisync II boards, might you know if there are any
   128Kx8 VRAMS 120ns around anywhere?  Or perhaps 256Kx4 DRAMS?
   I'd be looking for 216 VRAMs and 108 DRAMs (8 per and 4 per).
   If there aren't any over in your building I'll ask Mary B to
   get some.  Thank you for any input you can give.

ATTENTION - Spikers and Spikettes:

As you already know, we have an Atarian team - The Survivors, and we are
in need of a female player.

As Dave Shepperd shared with you, we are a pretty good team, but we do 
play for FUN.  Obviously, I won't be participating this season, (due to
my own volleyball growing under my shirt) so we need someone to take 
my place.  It would be nice to find two women, but I won't be greedy.

We do require you know what a volleyball looks like, what a volleyball
court is shaped like, and the basic rules and regulations of league play.
We all tend to forget some of the basics, so I would be more than happy
to "refresh" anyone's memory.

If you are the least bit interested, but still a little unsure - just 
give me a call.  I'll answer any questions - and better yet - I don't
bite!

We are a competitive, but fun bunch of people and we enjoy the pizza and
beer afterwards almost as much as playing.

Call me at ext. 3905 or vax via "RHONDA"

Subj:	VRAMs, DRAMs, and things that go bump in the night 


Rob, there are some things you should know:

   1. The parts list you seem to be building the boards from appears to
      be a preliminary version for Street Driver.

   2. I informed the Training group several months ago that they need to
      come up with their own parts list. Apparently they have not done so.
      This will lead to several people doing a bunch of otherwise
      unnecessary work.

   3. As far as I know, the Training group is not using the MSP. If this is
      true you do not need the following:

      MSP Parts:
	(1) 	137502-001 	74F244		
	(1)	137547-001	AS573		
	(2)	137440-001	ALS245		
	(4)	137694-120	256Kx4 DRAM	
	(1)	137538-002	34010-50	
	(1)	144008-005	50 MHz Osc	

      Notice that the 256Kx4 DRAMs are among the unneeded parts.
					
   4. I believe they are using the 12 Bit A/D which is not used by Street
      Driver. The 12 Bit A/D and associated parts are not on the Street
      Driver parts list.

   5. Note: VRAMs are specified as 120 ns with alternates of 100 ns and 
            80 ns.

	    DRAMs are specified as 120 ns with an alternate of 100 ns.

   6. The MultiSync II with sockets has failed and I have no way to test
      VRAMs other than to build boards, which isn't going to happen.
      (There was only one of the two boards with sockets built because
      Chris Downend decided that Karen had more important things to do.)

      There are currently two approved VRAMs:
		Toshiba: TC528126BJ-10
		Micron:	 MT42C8128DJ-10

      The boards we have already built used mostly Micron MT42C8127DJs which
      have been discontinued and TI TMX48C121DZs. The TMX means it is a
      Pre-Prod part which I will not approve. The Production parts (TMS)
      were supposed to be out last April; they weren't. Then they were 
      supposed to be out in June. Phil, the TI guy, doesn't know anything 
      about it (or anything else for that matter).

      When you buy VRAMs please try to get some Micron MT42C8128DJ-8
      and some TI TMS48C121DZ-10 and -80 if they are available. No TMX
      parts, please.
      
  7. This word just handed to me: ManMan reports there are 4000 VRAMs in
     inventory. 

     137693-100  IC,VRAM,128KX8,100NS,CMOS,40P SOJ

      
Regards,

	Jed

Sorry for the short notice, I forgot until today.  Hallmark's Will Philips and
a Rep. from Standard Microsystems Corp. will be here today to talk about SMC's
new COM20020 chip.

The COM20020 is a single chip LAN contoller with built in microsequencer and
2K bytes of SRAM.  It will transmit and recieve data at a rate of 2.5 MBPS
and will cost about $16 in quanities of 5K/YR.

From what I've read about the chip it seems very promising for a low cost,
low board space replacement for the current network board.  In fact if it is
as good as it appears, we won't even need to put it on a stack card, but can
put it right on the mother board.

I will be bringing the reps to the Eng. conf. room.  Please attend if your
interested.  Bring questions, we need to make sure this thing is for real.

Well, here goes again.  I wrote this file once in mail, but mail lost it and
I have to do it again...

Yesterday a few of us had a meeting with the sales rep from Standard
Microsystems Corp., SMC for short.  He confirmed some of the information I had
learned about a new chip they are offering, called the COM20020.  But we had
other questions which he could not answer, so he told me that an Engineer would
call today to answer the list we had formed yesterday.  For those of you who
don't know, I'll give a short list of the features of this ARCNET controller
chip as well as report on what I learned this morning.

Part number:	COM200X0
Vendor:		SMC
Price:		Approx. $16/5K/Yr (COM20020, 2.5MBPS)
Transmit speed:	2.5 MBPS
		5.0 MBPS binned.
Onboard SRAM:	2K x 8 in COM20020
		1K x 8 in COM20010
Protocol:	ARCNET

The COM20020 is a full featured network interface chip which is capable of
handling up to 512 byte packets.  It handles all network protocol including:
data encoding, transmision, receiving, decoding, error detection and correction,
and sends interupts to a host processor or microcontroller when packets are sent
or recieved.

If the host wishes to send a packet, then all he need do is transfer the data
into the COM20020's dual port SRAM, and tell the onchip microsequencer to send
the data.  When data is received the COM20020 interupts the host and if another
packet is recieved while the host is reading the first, the COM20020 will store
it in free memory.

The host can send broadcast packets or individual packets.

The best case time needed to broadcast a packet can be calculated as follows:

Tb = ((Ps + Is) * Bp * Tr) + Tt

Where:
	Tb is the broadcast time per node in microseconds.
	Ps is the packet size in bytes.
	Is is the information header size in bytes.
		2 byte CRC
		1 byte count
		3 byte address
		1 byte type
		1 byte preamble
		---------------
	  Total:8 bytes
	Bp is the bits per packet: 11.
	Tr is the transmission rate in us: 0.4 us.
	Tt is the time to pass the token: 25.8 us.

The equation can be expressed more simply:

Tb = ((Ps + 8) * 4.4) + 25.8

To give an example of use in our application lets run some test cases: assuming
we had a game the had to know what every other game was doing every 16 ms, which
is common in our applications.  The question is: depending on packet size, how
many nodes could be located on a single network, each node broadcasting one
packet to every other node within 16 ms.

Packet size	Tb	Max number of nodes
bytes		us
64		342.6	46
128		624.2	25
256		1187.4	13
512		2313.8	6

These are the best the part can do, if network errors are rampent, then
everything will slow down.  This is one thing we need to verify, that errors
are rare. 

With 5 MBPS parts, the number of nodes will double, so if in the furture we
need more data or more bytes per packet, then the option will exist to upgrade
to the faster part.

The current plan is to cludge some samples onto an existing board and see of
they perform as they should.

If you have any questions you can mail me (MCKEE), call me (X1731), or drop by
my office (cube outside pats office)

Subj:	"They cost how much?!!!!!"


We have recently had to order more Schlage security cards and, like most
things, the cost has increased considerably.  Sure, lately we have had a lot of
new hires to assign cards to, but we have also had to issue quite a few
replacement cards.  In some cases as soon as we re-issue a card, the elusive
one surfaces and the owner turns it in.  This is fine, but more and more this
isn't happening........ we are just loosing cards!!!

So, to make us more attentive to these flat, rectangular things, and to recover
the cost of ordering them, we will now be paying $10 (oowch!) for all
replacement cards.  Of course, if and when the original card is found and
turned in to Human Resources, the $10 will be reimbursed to the employee.

Remember, Schlage cards are assigned by number and can be checked by computer
so no fair turning in a fellow employee's card.

the place goes out of business??  Well, this is
Atari and flexibility is the name of the game.
Sooo, we just found another place on the spur of
the moment!  Now we're going to O'SHEA'S PUB &
GRILL at 258 Union Ave. in Los Gatos.  It's on
the corner of Union Ave. and Los Gatos/Almaden Rd.
There is a Safeway store on the other side of
Union for extra parking.  I have a map in my
cube for those not familiar with this neighborhood.
If you contacted old employees about the party
PLEASE call them back and let them know of the
change!  By the way, remember to let Pete, Elaine
or me know if you're planning to come so we can
get a rough guess of the numbers.

Howdy to all:

First a little background for my question:

We are a subsidiary of Time Warner.
Time Warner owns Warner Communications.
Warner Communications sells lots and lots of music tapes & CDs.
Warner Communications owns Ice-T, the popular rap artist/musician.
Ice-T has cut a record called "Cop Killer", which advocates killing cops.

So here's an interesting question that's come up for simulation products:

What do we do when we are demonstrating our new advanced driving simulators at
major public functions, and are suddenly deluged with picketers protesting
Time-Warner's sponsorship of Ice-T and his Cop Killer song?

This is real: it happened yesterday at the National Sheriffs' Convention in
San Diego.

It may happen next week at the International Association of Chiefs
of Police convention in San Antonio Texas. It may continue for a long time,
during which we will be trying to introduce our product into the law enforcement
community.

(Actually, this question may soon be faced by all of us in coin-op, as soon as
the offended people discover that Atari Games is owned by Time Warner. T/W-owned
businesses everywhere have been targeted for protests & boycotts.)

How do we balance our need to protect free speech with our desire to do
business?

It was suggested by the protesters that we lobby Time-Warner and Warner Com-
munications to moderate voices like those of Ice-T.

What do you think?  Please respond with your ideas for handling this very
real and perhaps soon-to-arrive-on-your-doorstep question...

Does ICE T's song "ADVOCATE" Cop killing? I think not.  Does "Murder, She
Wrote" ADVOCATE murder? Does the Murphy Brown having a child outside of
legal marriage ADVOCATE doing so?

	This is all a bunch of sh*t and I'm tired of it.

	This is and always has been the Reagan/Bush/Quayle way to avoid
real issues. Get everybody all excited about a ficticious TV character,
blame an artist, wrap yourself in the flag, blame the cultural elite,
(who is that anyway?). All this stuff does is steer people away from
concern for concrete, everyday problems that are no where near a solution.
What about jobs, education, health care, social security, the deficet?
It just makes me sick that people fall for this stuff like herds of cattle.
If this doesn't show the breakdown of the educational systems, I don't know
what does. People have gotten just plain stupid and have lost the ability
to think for themselves. It makes me wanna puke.

	What can we do about it? How does it affect Atari Games?
 
Don't worry about it. People's attention span is so short that everyone
will forget about it in a month or two. They will be on to the next 
non-issue fed to them.


Ban an artist, poet, or novelist. Who knows what they might say.

	Dave Akers found a bug in eedrive.c that has apparently been there
for some time, but not happened to bite anybody else yet because it needs
a specific set of circumstances. Anyway, it takes the form of a line:

	if ( (run_offs(new_bucket) + reclen(RUN_BYTES)) > EEPROM_SIZE ) {

that _should_ be:

	if ( (run_offs(new_bucket) + reclen(RUN_BYTES)) >= EEPROM_SIZE ) {

I have corrected the copies of eedrive.c in EE$USERDISK:[68K_US], and
EE$USERDISK:[68K_US.OS_91]. You _should_ be using the latter, but I just
_know_ some of you are using the former, so...

Right Carole.  Along those lines, one might say that Cop Killer is a 
response to an event much the same way that the old CSNY tune "Ohio"
was a response to National Guard presence on college campuses and in
the streets.  

Political games aside, the public reaction seems to be real.  The question
is whether or not the fact TW owns a majority of Atari will effect our 
ability to sell simulators.  This question needs to be evaluated first.

I think it may be a bit premature to consider lobbying TW, not to mention
whether this is morally and ethically what we want our company doing.

Have some levity,

1 > Ice-T has cut a record called "Cop Killer", which advocates killing cops.
  
  ..so we can come up with a video game that advocates police brutality.
There's even a 15min documentary video on this topic, maybe we could
beat our competitors and buy the license to it.  You game designers believe
me now and hear me later, THERE'S A GAME IN THIS.  We could call it "Beat a
KING" (no relation to BEAT-HEAD I mind you).
Let's give the demonstrators a legitimate reason to be mad at us, instead
of being mad at us for something TW does.!
Besides think of what the publicity would do to the earnings of the game.



2 > So here's an interesting question that's come up for simulation products:
  > What do we do when we are demonstrating our new advanced driving simulators
  > at major public functions, and are suddenly deluged with picketers 
  > protesting Time-Warner's sponsorship of Ice-T and his Cop Killer song?

  Let's take a serious(not) look at the "Beat a KING" game idea again.
Heck, If we make the game realistic enough, LAPD/LARRY GATES might like
it enough to utilize it in their training program.  Let's give the cops 
something they can relate to. Is there a new police trainer theme here?  
I don't know, you tell me.  I know we could definitely count on the 
approval of the 12 jurors in Simivalley and let me tell you folks it isn't 
often that a game company finds the courts on its side!
Ok, so a whole new game would be too much work and we didn't do so hot with
our last fighting game so maybe we should stay away from another mindless
,violent, disgusting gory looser and stick to something we know we can do
well.  What's that you asked?
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm




Ok Ok, I got it.  We make great driving games.  We could do a game where
you drive a car (maybe a black & white one) equipped with radar, computer
and guns.  Yeah GUNS GUNS GUNS!  Don't forget you must be able to shoot
obstacles and opponents.  Boy I think I've got something big here, for 
opponents we could use a tricked-out Beemer or Benze or what ever the 
negative stereotype car is these days and get this, are you ready,  are
you ready for this?  We could put Ice-T behind the wheels of that car
and the player (first person, driver of the black & white car) could 
tell Ice-T. to pull over, drag him out of his car and beat him senseless 
for 15 minutes out of fear for his life.
But wait, 15 minutes is a bit too long.  We'd have to do something about 
that,  can't have long game times cause we wouldn't make any money$$$$$
NO, COULDN'T DO IT, WOULDN'T DO IT, IT WOULDN'T BE PRUDENT. READ MY LIPS...



  
> It was suggested by the protesters that we lobby Time-Warner and Warner Com-
  munications to moderate voices like those of Ice-T.

  On a more serious note, if it's not too late to steer in that direction.
Above suggestion shows a clear lack of appreciation on the demonstrators part
for one of the most valued freedoms which makes the US. OF A. the great 
country that it is today.  We may not have a perfect society, and then again
the world isn't so perfect either.  But we do live in a country that
guarantees us many freedoms that are protected by our constitutional rights.
Freedoms which are coveted by people of other nations where they lack the 
essence of freedom.  
  Therefore we should act responsibly and not let certain elements within our
society sway our beliefs and principle towards their personal goals.  
Let's not cut Ice-T's vocal chords just because he offends the cops.
Our legal system failed to punish those whose actions offended a nation.
Ice-T is entitles to his opinion and we as a society have a responsibility
to protect his right to his opinion and his freedom of expression through his
music (if you can call it that) even if we don't agree with him.  I don't.
Censorship won't resolve the idealistic differences in any society, it just
sweeps our problems under a rug.  Today they want you not to by a record, 
next they'll tell you which book to burn, and before you know it they'll be
telling you how to think. 

Just think what that would do to creativity.

PS. I was kidding about the "BEAT A KING" game idea and I hope that this hasn't
offended anyone except maybe to foster some creative ideas among those who 
feel free to express their view in this forum.  Who knows there might be a game
in this after all.

Howdy again.

Thanks for all the responses to my question about balancing the need to
protect free speech and the desire to do business.

I hope that everyone who read my question understood that we in simulation
products were not cowering over in the corner wondering what to do about
protesters trying to disrupt our business because of someone else's totally
unrelated activities.

Rather, we were interested in getting a discussion going about a bigger issue.
It's a political campaign year, special interest groups are all out there
being very proactive and in some cases disruptive to those who do not support
them, and we may occasionally get caught in the crossfire.  You may face it at
the local grocery next time there's a clerks' strike, or when you try to take
your kids to the zoo and an animal rights activist throws a red liquid at you
as you walk in, for instance. Just thought it would be interesting to toss it
out to you and see what happened. Waahooo!

Anyway, thanks for the comments.

Subj:	Love Them Protests.


Re: Ice Tea Protests:

I love protesters. They make life interesting, and they
make me think about political issues that I would not
otherwise think about.

In this instance why are the protesters protesting?
What is thier issue? I do not know, does anyone?

Are they just opposed to killing police or is the music
really bad? Are they opposed to killing in general or
all music that advocates killing. Perhaps they are really
far right wingers that think killing is OK as long as it
is the "establishment" doing the killing. Are the protesters
just against any and all ideas that upset the status quo?

And what about the Ice T group? Could they be justified in
thier calls for action including violance? Have they ever 
been seriously violated by the "establishment" by way of
the police and court system? In many countries on earth
rising up against the government and the police is justified
and reasonable. It may be so in subsectors of our own country.

Yes protests are good. Please listen to what all protesters
have to say. There are often many issues involved, and many
points of view. Almost all protests are justified and the 
opposition (protested) have good reasons for what they are doing.

Eric.

Lover of freedom and protests.

Subj:	What's Happening?


On my way in this morning, traveling south on Milpitas Blvd., a motorcycle cop
passed me at a stop sign doing about 50 MPH.  As I approached the little mall
which is on the north west corner of Milpitas and Calaveras, I noticed him
pulling in through a red light.  As I turned right on Calaveras, there was a
police car stoped about 1/2 of the way up to the bridge.  The police officer
had his riffle out and was squatting behind the left rear fender with the gun
pointing in the general dirrection of the bank located below.

Is there a bank robery in progress or what?  Has anybody heard anything?

(Terribly curious to know whats going on)

Anybody who tries to rob a bank or ATM which is directly across the

But, knowing how milpitas police operate, it was probably just
another of their friendly traffic stops.

Subj:	More ICE


More observations about the ICEman...

1) Yes - Ice-T has the right to rap about anything that he wants to... but
I dont particulary enjoy being associated with his message.

2) If a corporation sponsered a group that traveled around the country
burning crosses and advocating killing blacks, what would the fallout be?

3) If past experience is any indication, the more that people protest and
boycott because of this song, the bigger a hit it will be. Witness "The
Last Temtation of Christ", a mediocre, low budget movie that became a mega-
hit after the Pope propelled it into the headlines. In fact, I'll bet that
Mr. T deliberately made his lyrics as provocative as possible for just this
reason, and that every group that calls more attention to his music adds
another digit to his bank account.

FOR RELEASE JUNE 8, 1992
 

    MOTOROLA ANNOUNCES FORMATION OF INFO ENTERPRISES:
          ON-LINE INFORMATION DELIVERY SERVICE
               FOR THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY
 
ANAHEIM, CA - Motorola New Enterprises, a business unit of
Motorola, Inc., today announced the creation of INFO
Enterprises, a company that will provide on-line component
data and other information used by engineers when designing
new products.  Texas Instruments Semiconductor Group and
Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector joined in the
announcement made at the Design Automation Conference; the
semiconductor companies unveiled plans to offer detailed
technical information about their components through INFO
Enterprises.  INFO Enterprises is working with other
semiconductor manufacturers on plans to offer their technical
information through the INFO Enterprises network, as well.

 INFO Enterprises should increase the competitiveness of
electronics manufacturers," said Robert A. Burton, chairman
and CEO of INFO Enterprises.  "This computer link between
semiconductor customers and suppliers will allow electronics
equipment manufacturers to get new technology to market
faster.  That's a significant competitive edge."
 
When introduced in 1993, the INFO Enterprises network will
offer engineers throughout the industry equal and unbiased
access to product information from multiple component
suppliers.  As the first information network to offer on-line
access to complete component data sheets from multiple
suppliers, INFO Enterprises will take semiconductor component
selection one step further into the future.
 
"Electronics manufacturers today can't afford to waste a
second researching a component's specifications," Burton
said.  "They want an immediate and seamlessly integrated
access method to multiple semiconductor manufacturers'
product data bases.  Via the INFO Enterprises network,
engineers will be able to gain access to this information
without leaving their desks."

For years, the only way engineers could obtain
specifications, part numbers and other technical data on
semiconductor components was by wading through pages of
reference manuals and product data sheets.  The process
diverted valuable engineering time from design of new
products.   There was also virtually no way of knowing if
newer information was available.  Moreover, the time demands
of book production meant delays in making information on the
latest components available to designers.
 
Existing computer-based media have streamlined the process
and made it more manageable.  But published information is
only as fresh as the printer is able to provide it.
 
Because the data on the INFO Enterprises network can be
instantaneously updated by component manufacturers
themselves, it will be the most timely product data
available.  INFO Enterprises' technology will make data
searches more comprehensive and faster.  Additionally, INFO
Enterprises' on-line technology will put product  and
component data right at the engineer's workstation.
 
Information on the INFO Enterprises network will be displayed
as it appears in paper documents.  With INFO Enterprises,
information can also be manipulated according to an
engineer's needs.  Searches can be conducted through menus,
by part number or by part attribute.  Full-text searches are
also possible.  And engineers can apply filters to customize
searches to their needs.  In addition, the INFO Enterprises
network will allow users to annotate documents and place
"book marks" on pages for later reference, just as they do
with printed catalogs.
 
Finally, because information will be maintained by suppliers,
data obtained through the INFO Enterprises network will be
the most accurate and up to date.  Since this data will be
available in machine-readable format, it will be accessible
by computer-aided engineering systems.
 
"INFO Enterprises will give engineers the most current,
accurate component data available in a form they can actually
use," Burton said.  "Engineers will be able to pull computer
files containing component specifications and engineering
drawings from the INFO Enterprises network and incorporate
them into their design.  That will significantly decrease the
time it takes to select and qualify a new component and get
their product to market."
 
Engineers can access INFO Enterprises via standard modems or
from in-house local-area networks (LANs) connected to INFO
Enterprises' wide area network.  Because the service will be
compatible with most users' existing computer and
telecommunications systems, access to INFO Enterprises will
not require additional hardware or network investments.
 
Texas Instruments and Motorola will be among the first
semiconductor manufacturers to make information available
through INFO Enterprises.  Other electronics component
suppliers are expected to be included by the introduction
date.
 
"INFO Enterprises offers Texas Instruments Semiconductor the
opportunity to decrease information-delivery cycle time with
major trading partners, as well as to provide superior
services to a broad range of customers," said Wayne Spence,
vice president, Worldwide Design Support, Texas Instruments
Semiconductor Group.
 
"Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector views direct
electronic connection to our customers through services like
INFO Enterprises as a key enabler for Total Customer
Satisfaction," said Ted Jaros, vice president and director,
Services and Planning, World Marketing, Motorola
Semiconductor Products Sector.
 
According to Burton, INFO Enterprises will provide
significant cost and competitive  benefits to both component
suppliers and their customers.  "INFO Enterprises will enable
suppliers to market their products more effectively simply
because engineers will know about them sooner and can
incorporate them into their new designs," he said.
"Equipment manufacturers will save valuable engineering time.
In addition, products will enjoy longer life cycles because
obsolete or end-of-life components may be identified before
they are included in a design."
 
For further information on INFO Enterprises, contact 1-800-
851-7536.
 
Motorola Inc. is one of the world's leading providers of
electronic equipment, systems, components and services for
worldwide markets.  Products include two-way radios, pagers,
cellular telephone systems, defense and aerospace
electronics, automotive and industrial electronic equipment,
computers, data communications and information processing and

Motorola was a winner of the U.S. Department of Commerce's
first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, in recognition
of its superior company-wide quality management process.

Subj:	EMAIL to and from outside the company


You, as a VAX user, can now send and receive email to and from nearly anywhere
in the world. Figuring out how to specify addresses is not as easy as it could
be, but it mostly works. You will probably not be able to REPLY directly to an
incoming internet or uucp message since the address will most likely become
trashed. MAIL will let you know (it'll say "unable to determine sender" or
"not a valid uucp or internet address"). What you can do is do a FORWARD/EDIT
and use the user's address in the To: prompt to reply to a message.

Your uucp address is (this is the address people would use to send email to
you):

agcvax.agames.com!your_vax_username

For example, my uucp address is:

agcvax.agames.com!shepperd

It's VERY important that the agcvax.agames.com be LOWERCASE. Your username can
be either upper or lowercase, the VAX doesn't care, but the mail routers only
know about our company's name in lowercase.

Some sites may not be able to get through with that address, so you can tell
the sender to add netcomsv.netcom.com! to the front. For example:

netcomsv.netcom.com!agcvax.agames.com!shepperd

which might work better. If neither of those work, then you can try using the
internet address format which is:

your_vax_username@agcvax.agames.com

for example:

All this is how you tell people how they send email to you. Here's how you
send mail to them:

Startup MAIL as usual use as a To: address the following syntax:

UUCP%"their_internet_or_uucp_address"

The percent sign and the double quotes are REQUIRED. You will also very
probably have to use lowercase characters in the
"their_internet_or_uucp_address". For example (it should match exactly with
case and punctuation how they tell you what their address is):

	$ MAIL
	MAIL>SEND
	To: UUCP%"netcom!shepperd"
	Subj: This is a test
	text of message
	^Z
	MAIL>EXIT

Words outside of the double quotes are not case sensitive.

Subj:	SPONSORS NEEDED!


My daughter and I will be participating in the AIDS Walk San Francisco on
Sunday, July 19. This 10K walk will take place in Golden Gate Park to benefit
several different AIDS organizations. I am looking for sponsors who will
pledge at least $1.00 per kilometer (that's a tax-deductable donation of $10
to AWSF). 

Please type in "REPLY" right now and say, "Yes, I've got $10 (or more)
to donate to this worthy cause!"; then I'll come and find you and collect your
money prior to July 19.

If you have any questions, please call me at ext. 3750. If you are interested
in walking along side me, I have a couple of additional registration forms.
Or you can call (415) 392-WALK [that's (415) 392-9255].

Thank you for your consideration and support.
                                                  --Linda

Subj:	Brainstormin' 1992 invite.


Hey, hey, hey let's BRAINSTORM... 

		 		OKAY! 

			Yes it IS going to happen. 
	
	As we have done in the past we will have 2 major parts to
BRAINSTORMIN'.  First we will have the onsite (that means here at
Atari) sessions which are open to anyone who submits two 1 page
proposals.  Second we will have our 3 day offsite sessions at Boulder
Creek Country Club which 40 people will be able to attend. 

	There will be something NEW this time. Instead of limiting the
BRAINSTORMIN' to PRODUCT ideas we will also be BRAINSTORMIN' on SYSTEM
ideas and ENABLEMENTS. 

	By "SYSTEM" we mean the SYSTEM that we all use everyday to
develop products. The SYSTEM is ATARI. And we will be BRAINSTORMIN' on
ideas that might help make the SYSTEM work better for everyone.

	An "ENABLEMENT" is that which allows or facilitates the
improvement of product quality. This includes but is not limited to,
technological improvements, gameplay innovations, software and
hardware tools. An ENABLEMENT should help solve the need to
continually improve the quality of our products. 

	So here is how it will work.
	
	Onsite BRAINSTORMIN' will be held on the afternoons of two
separate days. 	If you want to participate in these meetings you will
need to submit at least 2 concise written proposals NO MORE than 1 page 
each. 

Proposal #1	A concept and/or outline of PRODUCT or GAME IDEA and
		or an ENABLEMENT. 
Proposal #2	A concept and/or outline of SYSTEM or SYSTEM ENABLEMENT. 
		( Something that would make ATARI a better company.) 

	THIS IS BRAINSTORM! NO IDEA IS TOO SMALL, SILLY OR STUPID! 
		(For you old-timers "PO" still lives)

	Please VAX mail both of your 1 page proposals TOGETHER to this 
address. THE DEADLINE FOR BOTH PROPOSALS IS JULY 17th @ 11:59 pm.

	Once we receive all the proposals we will divide the proposals
into SQUADS of no more than 10 people. Each SQUAD of 10 will be put into 
a GROUP CATEGORY.  We will inform you as to whether your SQUAD is 
GROUP A or GROUP B. Your SQUAD will meet twice onsite. Each SQUAD will 
cover all the proposals of that SQUADS members under the appropriate TOPIC
for that group for that day. 

	DATE		TIME			TOPIC
					GROUP A     :	GROUP B
_________________________________________________________________
Friday July 31st 	2:00 to 5:00 pm	:  SYSTEM   :	PRODUCT	
Friday August 7th. 	2:00 to 5:00 pm :  PRODUCT  :	SYSTEM
________________________________________________________________________

	Offsite BRAINSTORMIN' will be held at BOULDER CREEK country
club on... 	    Sunday August 16th through Tuesday the 18th. 
40 people will be choosen from the group of onsite participants to 
attend the offsite sessions.

Happy 'stormin', go wild...

So, I'm peddlin' my --er, self-- away in the work-out room today
at lunch and SURPRISE! the right pedal came off.  Hmmm. Looks like
it just screws back on ... but, no, that didn't do the trick.  

So, I'm wondering if anyone out there took high school mechanics 
(obviously I did not) and could find a way to put the pedal to the
metal (pun intended) on the right side of the exercise bike in
the work-out room .... pleeeeeeease?  I'd be eternally grateful.

Mary,
      The AT&T RAMDAC (ATT20C478A) is exibiting bizarre behavior; AT&T
has promised to have someone who knows the part call me.

      In the meantime I thought I'd try the Brooktree part so I called Rex.
Yesterday they told me he was on vacation and would be back today. Today 
they told me he was on vacation and would be back on the 13th. They didn't 
say what month.   

      Would you do me a favor and see if you can get some parts for me this
week? I am under a lot of pressure to turn this board over to programmers.
The part is Brooktree Bt478KPJ35 or Bt478KPJ50 or Bt478KPJ66 or Bt478KPJ80.
I need at least three.

      Thanks,

of you expert code crackers would be able to decypher this table of numbers:

	$729e,$4000,$3b80,$2b35,$bc8b,$37b0,$644c,$d002
	$dfc5,$b123,$5119,$b979,$6f62,$6dc8,$ba31,$7ba1

Hint... this table of numbers is associated with the above data table:

	$005b,$0074,$0032,$005c,$0062,$005f,$008b,$00f8

If you figure out the answer (or think you have), keep it to yourself and
contact me immediately!  I will gladly provide complementary six-paks of
your favorite beverage for any correct decryptions.  Good Luck!

The following is what I got from Window NT conference:

1. Window NT is a operating system for
   INTEL x86
   MIPS

2. Window NT supports multiprocessors architecture system.

3. It has all the UNIX functionalities:
   security
   network
   file system (mount)
 \
4. It reboot just like DOC(push buttom),
   take only one minute on INTEL 486/50
   machine (much better than UNIX)

5. price only less than $500

So, we might need watch this new product.
It will become the major operating system in the future.
So all product we all doing now, need 
consider the portability.

As Wen mentioned, Windows NT has some very attractive features and, in my 
opinion, would be a wonderful development platform.  The beta test versions
are available now by calling 800-227-4679 and come in two flavors:

	$69	CD-ROM only.  Includes C compilers (both x86 and MIPS), tools
		and doc in PostScript format.
	$399	Above with printed manuals.

The above price includes the next developer's release which is scheduled
for Sept. 92.  Consumer version slated for shipping at the end of '92.

If enough people are interested, I would be happy to convey what the 
conference offered and give a general overview of NT.  If not, please
feel free to stop by and borrow the literature supplied by the conference.
Both Wen and I have received the complete SDK, and several others here will
also be receiving the CD-ROM.

I've just sold out of the 250 tickets that I had in hand,
however, I have 25 more coming in on Monday morning.  Please
give me your order for tickets, and you'll have them on
Monday, A.M.

Thanks for the overwhelming response.  I know we will
all have a good time.  Tank Tops and sun visors will be
given out next week -- hopefully, on Wednesday.  I'll be
in touch with each ticket holder. 

Thanks again.

I'll be upgrading all the VAXen to VMS 5.5-1 this sunday. I expect this to
take all day, so the systems will not be available for logins or batch jobs.
Sorry for any inconvience this may cause. This new version is claimed to have
fixes for a number of the problems we've been having with print and batch
queues. If this is true, it will be time well spent.

Subj:	SEGA'S NEW STADIUM CROSS


We took a little field trip this afternoon up to NewPark Mall in Newark
to see Sega's new motocross game at Tilt.  This game, Stadium Cross,  is 
two-player, will sell to distributors for about $10K and will be available 
in August.  Sega held a meeting in the UK recently to intro this game and
according to David Smith, his customers were did not like Stadium Cross as
well as Sega's other driving game, Virtua Racing.

Sega's bikes move side to side to steer, similar to Namco's Suzuka game.  On 
the Sega game, the player is also instructed on the screen to "pull up" on
the handle bars to jump the bumps and hills; the bike moves upward under
player control.  The flashing cabinet design and colors gives the game 
great curb appeal.

Game strengths:

Good graphics.  Growth motion pictures are smooth and very appealing.  There
is a diamond vision screen in the background with pictures that move and 
get larger as you get closer to it.

Good feel.  The steering control and wheelie feel pretty good.  The high-
flying airborn rush off the highest hills is great.

Great sounds.  The bike roars as you rev the throttle at the starting
line and adds a lot of excitement to the game play.  Also great is the
stadium announcers voice that keeps you up to date on the standings of the
race.  The announcer repeats certain phrases, though, which could become 
annoying.

Attack button is cool.  Instead of Moto's shooting, they have an attack
button that is used to punch out other riders near you on the track.

Game weaknesses:

Only one track.  Although competition between two players will keep the
game fresh, one track will get pretty boring after a while.

Little kids won't be able to move the bike to steer and do wheelies. 

Not enough feedback/reward to the player at the end of the race.  You are
told your place and that's about it.  Also, he manager of the location finished
the game and said that the final screen is not very exciting.


                                            --Linda

Today, Friday, between 11:00 and 1:30, the Recreation
Committee will distribute Tank Top Shirts for the
Company Picnic, along with sports packets for the
children.  There are plenty of sizes, but you will
only get shirts for as many tickets as you purchased.
We have a list, you do not need to bring your tickets
as proof.  Please be patient, we will try to accommodate
everyone.

When you go to the picnic tomorrow, and if you have plans
to play softball, you may want to bring your own glove/mitt.
Coyote Ranch does provide bats, etc. but they may not be
what you are used to.  So, if you want to, please bring your
own softball/baseball equipment.

Remember lunch is served from 12:00 to 1:15.  There will be a
plenty of prizes and a lot of fun.  Please come and enjoy the
day with your family.

Sorry, all tickets are sold.  If anyone out there decides to
change their mind at the last minute, you may want to let me
know or send a vax message that you have tickets to get rid 
of.

Thanks much.

JULY 8, 1992, 1700 PT                                  Number C-27

________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEM:  Bogus versions of the PKZIP archiving software have been 
          released to Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).
PLATFORM: PCs running PC-DOS, or MS-DOS
DAMAGE:   One version attempts to erase the hard disk.
DETECTION: Look for the files: PKZ201.ZIP, PKZ201.EXE, PKZIPV2.ZIP, or
          PKZIPV2.EXE 
REMOVAL:  Save a copy of the files for CIAC, then delete the files. Do
          not extract or run these files.
________________________________________________________________________
                Critical Facts about the PKZIP Trojan
  

CIAC has learned that two bogus versions of the popular archiving
utility PKZIP for PC-DOS and MS-DOS machines are being circulated on
several BBSs around the country. The two bogus versions of PKZIP are,
2.01 (PKZ201.ZIP and PKZ201.EXE) and 2.2 (PKZIPV2.ZIP and
PKZIPV2.EXE).  If you have downloaded any of these files, do not
attempt to use them.  You risk the destruction of all the data on your
hard disk if you do.

At the current time, the released version of PKZIP is version 1.10. A
new version of PKZIP is expected to be released in the next few months.
Its version number was planned to be 2.00, but may be increased to a
number greater than 2.2 to prevent confusion with the bogus versions.
PKWARE Inc. has indicated it will never issue a version 2.01 or 2.2 of
PKZIP. A good copy of the latest version of PKZIP can always be gotten
from the PKWARE BBS listed below.

According to PKWARE Inc. version 2.01 is a hacked version of PKZIP 1.93
Alpha.  While this version does not intentionally do any damage, it is
alpha level software, and may have serious bugs in it.

Version 2.2 is a simple batch file that attempts to erase your C:\ and
C:\DOS directories. If your hard disk has been erased by this program,
you may be able to recover it using hard disk undelete utilities such
as those in Norton Utilities, or PCTools. Don't do anything that might
create or expand a file on your hard disk until you have undeleted the
files, as you may overwrite the deleted files which will destroy them.
To examine a file to see if it is version 2.2, type it to the screen
with the DOS TYPE command. If the file that prints on the screen is a
short batch file with commands such as DEL C:\*.*, or DEL C:\DOS\*.*
then you have the bogus file.

If you should happen to see any of these files on a BBS, please contact
the sysop of that BBS immediately, and ask him to remove them. If you
have downloaded one of these files, please save a copy for CIAC, and
then delete the files from your hard disk. PKWARE Inc. has also asked
to be informed of any occurrences of these files, and can be reached
at,

     Voice: 414-354-8699    BBS: 414-354-8670    FAX: 414-354-8559

Hello

	I have been meaning to write this for a while.

	Outside my office is a bulletin board (on the floor)
on which I have posted the most recent review packets of 
all the products in development. They are there so everyone 
in the company can find out what various project teams are up to.

	Please remember the following:

	2. These are packets that were distributed before the

	When the Game Design Group moves to it's new location I will 
have the board mounted on the wall. In addition to the latest fieldtest 
location results I will also add other information such as schedules
and licensing information. Let me know if there are other information items

	We are missing some stuff. The first is a molex 2262 crimper
with padded orange handles. It is easily recognizable. It is in your

for link and serial cables. The second missing item is a new magna clear

After watching Emerson, Lake & Palmer today on Good Morning America,

Might any of you out there own a copy of a music book named 
ELP Anthology?  This book contains several of ELP's songs in their
entirety.  Included in it is their first hit single, Lucky Man.

I will consider myself a very lucky man if I could have access to this 
music again.  Let me know if you can help me out.

Subj:	A SW package report.


To   : SW engineers.

I work in the simulation group. I have been working on a user
interface that runs on a PC. I bought a graphical user interface
toolkit from Island Systems. It does interactive menus. I am very
pleased with its ease of programming and how well it works.

The package name is Object Menu. It resembles the Motif interface
specifications from OSF (Open Software Foundation). The toolkit is
written in C++ and requires either Borland 3.0 or MicroSoft 7.0.

The toolkit cost $300 and comes with about 100 examples that 
shows most of the major features. Source is also available for
$530. I have ordered the source code.

If anyone is doing something similar I would be happy to give a demo
and get you started if you want to buy and use Object Menus.

Eric.

Subj:	FYI


For the benefit of our new employees, a couple of pieces of info that
might be of interest.

Directions to the Milpitas Post Office:
Go East on 237, towards Milpitas and stay in the right lane (like you
are going to turn onto the San Jose on-ramp, but instead keep on going
straight, as soon as you pass the 880 off-on ramps, switch to the right
lane again, now you are close to the curb, stay on this for a block and
you will come to Abel street (you should now be at an intersection that
is Abel and Serra), turn right at this light, you will come to another
light (I believe it is Corning St.), go across this light and just a
little ways after you cross Corning, you will find the Milpitas Post
Office on the left side of the street.  I thought this info might be
helpful, since I've heard some @#*@?//, after some people set  out to
find the @#%//blankety, blankety, post office.  At any rate the U.S.
post office is on Abel St.

On to Point 2:  For those of you who might have to turn gas mileage
forms, the reimbursement amount stands at 27.5 cents/mile.

Point 3:  Petty Cash forms:  If you have noticed, the Petty Cash
form does not contain a date line.  It would be a good idea if some
where on the form you put a date when you fill one of these out.  May
be by your signature.  Thanks.

Feel free to correct me on any of this info, if you know something I
don't.

if they are available.  These prices are for one week's accomodations:

	At the Stardust, Lake Tahoe:		$150 ($22 per night)
	Any available resort in the US:		$250 ($35 per night)
	Any available resort internationally:	$275 ($39 per night)

There are several in Hawaii, Mexico, and Florida.  They are all quite
nice.  If you're interested, come by my office at take a look at the
catalog, or call x1714.

  >>> If you are already on the team please confirm to George that you expect
    to be there so he has an idea of how many ringers he's going to need!!!!!

                           written by Bob Warznak
                         (updated August 11, 1992)

Moment #1 
Jerry and George in the Cafe.  
Jerry:     Pass the cream George.
[The guy with the torch runs comes in.]
George:    Hey look.
Torch Guy: Hi, maybe you can help me, I'm lost.  Do either of you know
           the way to Barcelona from here?
Jerry:     Well I'd take the West Side Highway to the Cross Bronx.
George:    Hold, Hold.  Wat are you nuts, at this time of the day.  Listen
           to me.  Take the FDR to the Major Deagan.
Jerry:     What are you talking about, the FDR is under construction.
George:    He's running.


Moment #2 
Jerry and George in the Cafe.  The guy with the torch runs in, grabs a
bag pays for it and leaves quickly.
Jerry:  Hey look.
George: You supposed to tip on a take out order?
Jerry:  Not when you're carrying the torch.


Moment #3 
Set in Jerry's apartment.  Jerry is talking to Elaine on the phone.
Jerry: Yeah Elaine the guy's on his way over to fix the oven.  I think
       it's the pilot light.
[Knock at the door.]
Jerry: Hold on, there he is now.
[Torch runner runs in, opens the oven door and lights the pilot, and leaves.]
Jerry: So I set it to 375 and I baste every 15 minutes. Uh huh. Thanks.


Moment #4 
[This is the only one I haven't seen.  Mark Shneyder sent me this write up.]
The phone in Jerry's apartment rings while he's unlocking his door
and it's a guy from a radio station leaving him a message telling him
that he, Jerry, just missed a trip to Barcelona. When Jerry finally
walks in,the radio guy already hung up. Jerry picks up the receiver
and goes "Hello Hello Hello ....".


Moment #5 
Jerry and George in the Cafe.
Jerry:  How come only athletes get nicknames like Karl "The Mailman" Malone?
George: Writers should have nicknames.
Jerry:  Yeah, like Carl "The Truth" Sandberg.
George: Leo "Prime Time" Tolstoy.
Jerry:  Judith "In Your Face" Krantz.
George: Tom "The Refrigerator" Clancy.
Jerry:  Eugene "The Real Deal" O'Neil.  

 
Moment #6 
Jerry and George in the Cafe.
Jerry:  How dou you cheat in yachting?
George: It's simple, you stick a small motor under the hull.  They
        never check.
Jerry:  Don't you think they'd be a little suspicious when one boat
        wins by 16 hours, with no wind?  Hmm?


Moment #7 
Jerry and George in the Cafe.
George: Hey the judo finals are today.  I love that, especially when
        they break the bricks.
Jerry:  That's Karate.
George: You sure, maybe its Jujitsu.
Jerry:  No, Jujitsu is strictly self defense.
George: What about Aquita. (sp?)
Jerry:  That's a dog.  You mean Akido.
George: Okay then what's Tai Kwan Do.
Jerry:  That's a judo, but with the spicy prawns.


Moment #8
Jerry and George in the Cafe.
George: Unbelievable.
Jerry:  What's that?
George: This Olympic diver is a 13 year old girl.
Jerry:  Hmm.
George: When I was 13, I used to run through the sprinkler with an inner tube.
Jerry:  Well, girls mature faster than boys.


Moment #9 
Jerry and George in the Cafe.
Jerry:  Hey you want to watch the Olympic diving?  It's on in 20 minutes.
George: Nah, no action.
Jerry:  What are you talking about?  Remember in '88, Louganis hit his head on
        the board and then won the gold medal.
George: Yeah, what are the odds of that happening again?
Jerry:  No, that's a dive now.  The highest degree of difficulty.  The
        Louganis, half-gainer, no-brainer.

Moment #10
Jerry and George in the Cafe.
George: Hey, modern Pentathelon's today.  That's 5 events right?
Jerry:  Right.
George: Wonder what the Ancient Pentathelon is?
Jerry:  Well, there was the eat run and wretch.
George: The Caligula head toss.
Jerry:  The 400 meter Emperor stab.
George: Poke the eye of the Cyclops.
Jerry:  Poke the eye of the Cyclops, and the run till your dead.


Moment #11 
Jerry and George in the Cafe.
George: Why don't they have olympic dog racing?
Jerry:  Well it doesn't involve humans.  It's cruel to the animals.  It's
        surrounded by liquor and gambling.  It's the total antithesis of 
        the Olympic spirit.
George: Sure, professional dogs.  I'm talking amateur.


Moment #12 
George and Kramer in the Cafe.
George: Target shooting, that's a dull one.
Kramer: They ought to have all the competitors meet in the center of town
        in the Olympic village and just shoot it out like the OK Corral.
George: So there'd be no silver or bronze.
Kramer: No, no.  It be a total elimination.


Moment #13 
In the Cafe, Jerry and George watch Kramer show off his olympic gymnastics
talent and grace.
Kramer: You grab the rings, and then you pull yourself up until your arms are
        completely parallel.  And then... 
[Kramer has his arms extended and starts to shake and shiver.]
Kramer: It's called the iron cross.  It's the most graceful thing I've ever
        seen.  And then you dismount.
[Kramer falls backward, kicking Jerry and George's table.  He falls onto a
 stool along the counter.]
Kramer: Well, a cup of coffee please.


Moment #14 
Jerry, George and Kramer are being interviewed right off the set of the
show.
Interviewer (John): Great show today guys.  Jerry, I don't think I've 
        ever seen you funnier.  You know that may have been a personal
        best.
Jerry:  Thanks John, it felt good out there.  I tell you I couldn't have
        done it without these guys.  There's no "I" in funny.
Kramer: There's a lot of words with no "i".  Texas.. rug..
John:   Kramer, how'd you feel out there.
Kramer: Banana.. hydrant..
John:   George, are you looking forward to sweeps week.
George: Oh no no no no no, we're gonna take it one show at a time.
Kramer: Cat.. Flower..
John:   Well that's the story from here.  Now back to the studio and Bob.
Kramer: Horseshoe.. Bob.


Moment #15 
Jerry interviewing a gymnist, with the olympic rings and the NBC logo 
in the background.
Jerry:  I'm here with 8 year old Kathy Kwan, star of the gymnastic
        team.  You must be looking forward to the games Kathy.
Kathy:  Yes, those games are very special to me.  As I will retire
        when they're over.
Jerry:  Retire?  You're kidding.
Kathy:  I'm not 6 anymore.  Besides you have to give those
        youngsters a chance to make their mark.  
Jerry:  What are your plans for the future?
Kathy:  I like to spend more time with my parents and watch them
        grow up.

At that, Jerry rolled his eyes (like you've all seen him do on the
show) and turned the other way.


Moment #16 
Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries is in Jerry's apartment.  He's using his 
usual Unsolved Mysteries tone of voice.  The Unsolved Mysteries theme is 
playing in the background.
Robert: July 1989, Jerry Seinfeld and three friends embark on a neurotic
        journey through New York City, obsessing over life's tiniest
        details.  One day they mysteriously disappear.  Never seen again.
        If you have any information concerning the whereabouts ...

[Jerry enters from the left, off camera.]
Jerry:  Hey, hey Bob. [Music dies out]  Here I am right after you, 
        Wednesdays on NBC.
Robert: Another mystery solved. [Music picks up again.] Did you call me Bob?


Moment #17 
Jerry sitting by his computer in his apartment.
Jerry: Do you know the correct pronunciation of Barcelona is actually 
       Barthelona?  That's because, many years ago, the King of Spain 
       spoke with a lisp and the members of the court, trying to curry 
       favor with the King, adopted his unusual speech pattern.  Absolutely 
       true.  Just a piece of Olympic trivia for you.  I'm Jerry Theinfeld.


Moment #18
Jerry sitting by his computer in his apartment.
Jerry: Do you know why the marathon is 26.2 miles?  Because in Ancient 
       Greece, a man named Phadipadeis ran from Sparta to Marathon 26.2
       miles.  He delivered a message collapsed and died.  Had he run to 
       the town of Sprint, a mere 100 meters away, Phadipadeis would be
       alive today.  I'm Jerry Seinfeld.


Moment #19
Actually a promo for Blossom.  The characters Blossom and Joey are sitting
on a sofa watching TV.
Joey:    Hey look at that, Seinfeld's coming back early.
Blossom: We're coming back early, too.
Joey:    We're going to be on Seinfeld?
Blossom: Yes Joey.  Kramer's our new father, Dad's dating Elaine and George
         is gonna live over the garage with Tony.
Joey:    Woo, I better go clean my room.
Blossom: He's an idiot.

Subj:	No, Virginia, There is no Coffee Fairy

	I know that your parents (not to mention those waitresses at Lenny's,
er, Denny's) have tried very hard to convince you that the coffee fairy
exists, and makes new coffee whenever she sees an empty pot, but it's time
you learned the truth.

	In fact, the truth is even more amazing. Empty coffee pots are re-filled
by members of a secret society sworn never to let the National Blood Caffeine
Level drop. And here's the best news: _Y_O_U_ can be a member of this ancient
and mystical society. The only trick is in recognizing the opportunity for your
initiation. The next time you pour yourself a cup of java, check the level of
the pot. If there's less than a full cup left YOU WIN! Isn't that amazing.

	To demonstrate your fitness for membership, you need only perform the
mystical pot-refilling ritual, which consist of dumping the old grounds, putting
in a new filter, ...

	But then, I don't want to get involved in a religious war
between the one-packet and one-and-a-half packet sects, so I'll just say
follow your conscience or seek guidance from an initiate.

	Several prominent Atarians are members of the group, but don't think
you are too lowly to join. There is room in the great filter-basket for all.
Just be careful not to break the chain or (OOOPs, wrong pitch)

Subj:	Midi conversion program


I have been asked to make available our midi conversion program, MIDI2LSD.
MIDI2LSD does not convert midi files to LSD (sorry) or even to RPM files.
Instead, it converts midi files directly into a table of note frequencies
(Sega Genesis or Nintendo format), durations (in frames), amplitudes, etc.
As such, it may not be immediately useful to coin-op. Anyway, the source
code and a sample of the output are in TE$USERDISK:[TAUDIO]MIDI2LSD.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Subj:	Reverse engineering product description


The IDE product is a tool to document existing C code.  You give it
C source and a makefile, and then wait while it does an analysis of the code.
It is parsed and a relational database is generated which allows you to
browse the program and data structure graphically.  Or you can query the database
asking for things like every routine which writes a specific variable, or
all functions which return a pointer to a particular type of struct. With
the graphical editor, you can start at main and then point and grunt your
way though the calling heirarchy.  Clicking on an icon will bring up the
associated source.

This is what they SAY it does.  The demo is to give them some samples of our
code and see if it works.

Hello

	I'd like everyone to welcome Kevin Filson to the Game Design
Group. I have been out and am a bit late with this announcement. Kevin
reports to me and has been hired to fill a new temporary position called
Fieldtest Support. He will be joining in the effort to help make sure we
have quality fieldtest and help take some of the responsibility of
collecting and maintaining our test units. When he is not running from 
arcade to arcade he is also available for testing.

	Kevin has tested with us before and should be a familiar face to
some of you here. He will be sharing a space in Haywoods area until the
GDG moves to it's new headquarters when the construction is done. Please
welcome him and also please use him to help improve the quality of the
games we create.

Subj:	Audio board alert


Since the birth of JSA3 with Batman, numerous JSA3s and SAIIs are now floating
around being used on hardware in developement.  With a 6502 program and some
sounds, you too could have cool sounds and music on your game under develope-
ment.  Well, thanks to an oddity of the 6502, RPM had to change how it addresses
things on audio boards.  This manifested itself in a new DECODE gal which is
imcompatible with the older one used on Batman, MMII, OTW, Talons, Road Riot,
etc.  Soooooooo, the next time you rig up a new hardware and pop a JSA3 board
on it (SAIIS is pretty much extinct) be sure to reprogram the DECODE gal (17C)
using the new JED file located at:  [AUDIO.PALS.JSA3] DECODE.JED.  I renamed
the older files OLD_DEC.xxx .

To Any Software Engineer.

I have been doing some coding in C++. I would like
to share my learning in a public way. I am starting
the "Atari Software Engineering School." There will
be a lesson every week or two. I will mail out 
(VAX Email) the lessons.

The format will be I will ask a few questions and
you will mail back your answers. I will post your
answers (unless requested otherwise) so that others
may also see and comment on them. I will post my 
answer to the question. Everyone may coment on the
correctness of the answers.

So that I do not clog up the JUNK mail REPLY to me
so that I can make a mail list of participants.

Proffessor Eric.

The first lesson is:

Use C++ and all good engineering practices know to you.

Write a stack with the following characteristics:
Operations are:
1) push
2) pop
3) is_full
4) is_empty

The items that can be put onto the stack are "int."
Modify the stack to put a "struct" onto the stack.

Write the test code to show that it works.

	Yet another mail message concerning a lost coffee mug - of the
ATARI / TENGEN variety.  My name's on the bottom, so next time you hoist
a cup of java with one of these distinctive collector's items, take a 
gander (look, not goose) at the bottom to see if my name's there.  Thanks.

Subj:	ATARI FOOTBALL LEAGUS (AFL)


Now you can be the owner of a fantasy football team made up of stars
in the NFL and compete with your friend's fantasy football team.

If we can get 8 to 10 teams (made up of 1 to 4 owners per team) to sign
by Wednesday, September 2, we will have our draft of players at 5:30
p.m. on September 3, (I will host the refreshments).  Each team would
draft players who will be eligible to score points each week.

The estimated range of highest winnings or lowest losses is about $120
per team for the 16 week season.  If you are interested see self 
appointed commissioners Bob Sheffield or Rick Thompson for official
rules.

Again, there needs to be 8 to 10 teams signing up and we will have the
first AFL draft of players on September 3.  If you have any questions,
see Bob or Rick.

 I've got a sun-roof visor/wind deflector for my car but it
won't work for me since I have a pop-up type and this is
for the other type of sunroof which are factory installed.

Anyway, before I return it to vendor for credit I'll sell it
for $30.00  

If anyone is interested call 1775 or see me.  -Farrokh-

If you are wondering what a wind-deflector/visor is and
what you would use it for, it's a tinted plexiglass
piece that mounts on the top just in front of your 
sun roof and keeps sun and road bugs off your face when
you're driving with the roof open.  It's simple and can
be installed in 5-minutes. There.

Subj:	Proposed PCB fabrication spec


Due to increasing clock rates and use of faster logic, the need for controlling
PCB trace impedance has arrived. To this end Art Jackson and I are suggesting
the following spec for the arrangement and thickness of the layers in our PCBs.
Note that the center insulator thickness is not specified, only the overall
sandwich thickness.
4-LAYER

ALL INTERNAL LAYERS ARE 1 OZ. COPPER (0.0014")

/			----------------------------	<-- TRACE PLANE
| 5-7 MIL INSULATION ->	////////////////////////////
|			----------------------------	<-- POWER/GROUND PLANE
|			////////////////////////////
 > 62 MIL OVERALL	////////////////////////////
|			////////////////////////////
|			----------------------------	<-- POWER/GROUND PLANE
| 5-7 MIL INSULATION ->	////////////////////////////
\			----------------------------	<-- TRACE PLANE
6-LAYER

ALL INTERNAL LAYERS ARE 1 OZ. COPPER (0.0014")

/			----------------------------	<-- TRACE PLANE
| 5-7 MIL INSULATION ->	////////////////////////////
|			----------------------------	<-- POWER/GROUND PLANE
| 5-7 MIL INSULATION ->	////////////////////////////
|			----------------------------	<-- TRACE PLANE
|			////////////////////////////
 > 62 MIL OVERALL	////////////////////////////
|			////////////////////////////
|			----------------------------	<-- TRACE PLANE
| 5-7 MIL INSULATION ->	////////////////////////////
|			----------------------------	<-- POWER/GROUND PLANE
| 5-7 MIL INSULATION ->	////////////////////////////
\			----------------------------	<-- TRACE PLANE
The nominal impedance for an 8 mil trace on these boards should be around 50
ohms. 

The reason for putting the second 2 trace layers between the power and ground
planes on the 6-layer PCB is that this keeps all signal layers a constant
distance from a plane and thus keeps the impedance more or less constant
regardless of which trace layer you are on. This also means that the impedance
you see on a 6-layer PCB should  be similar to that of a 4-layer PCB which will
(we hope) make your 4-layer PCB behave just like your prototype. 

If the loss of visibility of the second two trace layers is a problem for you,
you can always override the spec and put them on the outside.

I'd like to get comments (yea/nay/other) on this from everyone before getting
out the granite and the chisel so please respond before Friday 9/18 or forever
hold your tongue.

Subj:	Wolfenstein 3D workings...


People have been curious about the new PC game Wolfenstein 3D.
We have wondered how the speed of the "real" 3D effect was accomplished.
This explanation came off the usenet from someone at SGI:

Wolfenstein 3D cheats.  It's not really drawing 3D textured polygons.
What it's doing is sort of a cross between ray tracing and bitmap
decimation.  For each column of pixels on the screen, they shoot a ray
out and find which wall it intersects with.  From the length of the ray,
they know the top and bottom coordinates of the wall in screen space,
and from the intersection point of the ray with the wall, they know
which column to use from that wall's texture.  By decimating or
duplicating pixels from that column, they resize it to be the correct
height for the screen.

Just a quick warning.  A Tengen employee had an attempted car break-in
early this afternoon.  Luckily his car alarm went off and alerted fellow
employees who thwarted the attempt.  If you normally don't lock your 
vehicle, you might want to start.  The Milpitas police said this was not
the first report in this area.  If you leave the building after dark, ask
someone to watch you get safely to your car - female employees especially.

If you see anything out of the ordinary, call the Milpitas police -

Hello

	I am happy to announce that we have a "NEW" employee to welcome
back to Atari. Mike Hally has become a permanent fulltime employee. His
title is Senior Game Designer and is the most senior member of the
Game Design Group which reports to me. For the time being his office
will be in Rusty's old office which is waiting for a desk.

	Mike, as most of you know, has over 14 years of history with
Atari. He started here back when we had a pinball division. Since that
time he has be a crucial core team member on a large number of Atari 
Games past classics. Star Wars, Gravitar, Firefox, Temple of Doom, 
Road Runner, APB, and Blasteroids to name a few. Recently he has been a 
serving as a contracter helping out on Skull and Crossbones, Marble 
Madness 2, Relief Pitcher and Moto-Frenzy.

	In his new position he will, as usual, wear many hats. He will 
be a Project Leader and Game Designer.  He will also be helping me grow 
the relatively new Game Design Group.  I look forward to the great 
products his continued dedication to Atari Games and the coin-op industry 
will bring as well as the influence he will have on defining the Game 
Design Group. 

	He is a fairly shy and quiet guy so please stop him in the hall 
and make him feel welcome.

Welcome Back Mike!

TO:  All Atari/Tengen Employees
RE:  Atari Games v. Nintendo Lawsuit

Today we received news that the Court of Appeals has rejected our appeal
of the copyright injunction previously issued against Atari Games and
Tengen in our Nintendo lawsuit.  We are, obviously, disappointed at the
outcome of the appeal, as we believe our position to be the right one.  
There are still multiple legal issues yet to be decided in the future.

I would like you to know that the decision does not have an effect on
Atari's core business of coin-operated games nor does the decision have
much of an effect on Tengen's business.  Tengen's business has been
concentrated in providing software products for the Sega Genesis and
related Sega software products for the last twelve months or more.

While I am disappointed about the outcome of this ruling, you should
not be discouraged, as we had anticipated this as a potential result
and are, therefore, well positioned to move forward.  Let's work for
the future together.

I'll keep you further informed when new developments occur in the lawsuit.

Dimensions are about 70" W x 28" D x 36-40" H.  It isn't frost-free, but he

Subj:	Gx2 Hardware Seminar


	I'm overwhelmed !.. not by the number of people interested in the
seminar, but by the number of responses pointing out that Sept. 18 is not
Thursday but is actually Friday. I was only trying to see whether you are
paying any atention. Well, actually, I goofed. How about:

	Time: 2:00pm  Monday, Sept. 21th 1992
	place: central conference room
	subject: How to make Atari great again : Family Values. JUST KIDDING,
		 we'll talk Gx2 hardware.

	Since there are a few people who will benefit from a more detail 
explanation  of the spec. and programming model of Gx2 and are too busy to read 
GX2.DOC, here's the schedule:
	
	2:00 PM  software aspect of Gx2 hardware, GX2.DOC.
	2:45 PM  Break
	3:00 PM  Gx2 Hardware: block diagrams, schematics, micro-code/flow

Subj:	Welcome to new people.


I am happy to announce the addition of two new employees to the 
Electrical Design Department.
 
Carol Dominy joined the company yesterday as a Senior Hardware 
Engineer. She comes from the NASA Goddard Space Flight center ground 
services division, in Maryland. She and her husband moved to 
California a few months ago. You can find her holding on tightly to 
her Atari Mug, sharing John Moore's office for a couple of days and
then in the new Hardware lab area, in the office vacated by Ray
Sherman. (Components moved to a new location). Please stop by and say 
Hi!, even if you already met her on the tour. There were a lot of 
names to remember.

Paul Shepperd, an old face to many, joined the Electrical Design 
group as an Engineering Technician yesterday. Paul transferred over from
Manufacturing where he has spent many years supporting Atari's 
production line. Paul will also be located in the Hardware Lab area.

Share my pride in welcoming these talented people in our group.

						Pat Mc Carthy.

Subj:	Shepard not Shepperd.


Well, don't you thing I could at least spell the name right.

Paul spells his name SHEPARD, not to be confused with Dave SHEPPERD. 
Paul does not have a VAX name yet. When he does, it won't be PAUL 
(because John Paul got there first), and it won't be SHEPARD because 
everybody confused Shepard/Shepperd when Byron was here. This is 
where we get creative.
						Pat Mc Carthy.

(Carol can be reached by VAX at DOMINY)
