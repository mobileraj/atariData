Subj:	My retirement from the Facilities Department


	I've had my duties reorganized, and am no longer able to spend the
time supporting Facilities that I have thus far.  Instead, I'm going to be
doing more computer programming, which is (theoretically) why I am here.
This message is intended to let you know who to talk to when you would have
looked for me.

	For any kind of telephone or terminal problems, contact Dennis Nale
through the operator.  The operator will be able to resolve some of the phone
problems herself; those that she can't cure will be passed on to Dennis.

	For changes in Schlage access, contact Sandy Brown.

	For other facilities-related questions, talk to Bob Frye.  This includes
anything that doesn't work right except for telephones and terminals.

	Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

Subj:	401-K employer matching for 1989


          We are pleased to announce that we will retain the same Atari
matching contribution to the 401-K Plan for calendar year 1989 that we had
in 1988.  The matching contribution will work as follows:

             Employee                  Atari                       Total
      Contribution Amount       Matching Contribution           Contribution

        First $  500                $1,000                        $1,500
        Next   3,000                 1,500                         4,500
        Next   3,813                  -0-                          3,500

       Totals $7,313                $2,500                        $9,500

This means Atari contributes $2.00 for each $1.00 you contribute up to $500,
thereafter from $501 to $3,500 Atari contributes $.50 for each $1.00 you
contribute.  Even if you can only contribute $10 per week you get $20 from
Atari, which means at the end of one year you would have $1,500 in your 401-K
account.  Not bad!

Please remember that your contributions can be spread over the entire
calendar year, and that the above matching will apply throughout calendar
1989.  Also, the $7,313 illustrated is the maximum that can be contributed
by any employee based on 1988's maximum.  This amount will be increased for
1989, and you will be advised of the new maximum amount at a later date.

This Atari Matching Contribution is effective for 1989 only.  A decision on
Atari's Matching Contribution for 1990 will be made in December 1989.

Subj:	ikos pc-clone


friends and neighbors:

	i am requesting anyone that intends to use the pc-clone that is 
hooked up to the ikos box to please refrain for the next month. i need
all the disk space for clippy debug purposes. if this poses insurmountable
hardships come see me and we'll "discuss it". also a policy of backing
up all pc files to the vaxes will be in effect as of now, on the advice
of jim morris. so if you have a file on this particular pc, and i need the
disk space i will assume (after a 2 day grace period) that you have saved
it to the vax and the pc disk space is fair game.
	i think i have already talked to the appropriate people in
person, so this is the last warning if anyone in vax land has a comment
about this policy.

p.s. i have the keys to this pc if you have a legitimate (as defined
by me, rich moore,morgan hoff or dave shepperd) need to get on it.

Subj:	TV TONIGHT


Usually I like to recommend watching something (usually a film) of merit
on broadcast television. Today, however, I would like to suggest a show
that you should not watch - the Ronnie Reagan farewell Rah-Rah at 6 pm.
As we all know, he will smile, wave, and chuckle while announcing all
his great accomplishments in office. (Tripling the deficit, increasing
taxes, cutting out needed programs, packing the Supreme court, stomping
on human rights...)  If you really must watch television at that hour, I 
could recommend some other shows that won't insult your intelligence as
much. On channel 2 is "Three's Company", channel 20 is playing "A Team",
"Hawaii Five-O" is on 36, and if you get channel 40, you can watch "Family
Ties".

Actually, there is a good flick on the tube tonight at 8 pm, channel 36.
It's titled "The Train" with Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield. It is a
World War II drama about trying to stop a Nazi train full of France Art
Treasures. It becomes a personal contest between the two main characters.
It is good, check it out.

Subj:	Not a farewell..


	Not to worry... Ronnie will be with us for a long long time.

	He will breath in our pollutants.
	He will run free in our drug tests.
	He will thrive in our deficit.
	He will be reborn in our courts.

	We won't need to miss him,  we were all included in his will.

Subj:	STUN cabinet configuration meeting 1/13/89 11:00 a.m.


We need to nail down the cabinet configurations for S.T.U.N. 
Runner. There are numerous possibilities. The possibilities 
for which we have done cost estimates are (distributor prices
-- 40% margin included):

	19" Family cabinet   -- $3,020
	25" Family cabinet   -- $3,335
	25" Sit-down cabinet -- $4,125
	  (comperable to Hard Drivin')

Those of you who are interested in helping with this decision, 
please meet in the STUN lab at 11:00 Friday (the 13th). Please 
invite others who should be in attendance.

Thanks!!

Subj:	Slapstick 


File:	[LOGG.DND]BYPASS.DOC
Date:	February 10, 1989

	A company in the UK has come to us with a kit for Gauntlet II which
bypasses the slapstick.  This is how they did it.  Please keep this technique
in mind when you are doing your next game.

	The slapstick works by taking an address space of length 8000 and
selecting one of four banks of length 2000.  In general, the same bank
repeats itself four times in the address space.  If the slapstick is removed
and two wires are substituted, then the full 8000 address space is available.
In the case of Gauntlet, and I assume other Atari games, the addresses used 
to reference data or program in the slapstick area are for bank 0 only.  Now,
if someone were to change the addresses in all instructions which reference
the slapstick to the appropriate bank, then they would have defeated slapstick 
completely.  This is an oversimplification but you get the idea.

	This is what happened in Gauntlet.  They changed our jump table from
address in the range 0-1FFF to 0-7FFF.  They never had to discover how the
banking works.  They could have easily tried all four possibilities to get
the right address.  In Gauntlet, I thought we were safer because the data
was compacted in a very obscure fashion.  This apparently didn't stop them
either.   We also checksummed portions of our program so they couldn't change
our program.  Unfortunately we did not checksum our jump tables in the 
slapstick area.

	Their method can be defeated in many ways.  We could have used one
instruction, like JSR 1000, to jump to either of the four banks depending on
a condition set up previously.  We could have put code in the slapstick area
to make it a little harder.  We could have put a JSR in the slapstick area
which would return to another bank.  There are many other techniques which
I will not go into here.

Subj:	SLAPSTIC usage


SLAPSTIC USAGE
ATARI GAMES
DOUG SNYDER
890210

When using slapstic to protect a game from being copied, two important items
should be kept in mind.

1. The SLAPSTIC hardware should use the 2 SLAPSTIC select bits (BS0 and BS1)
	to page memory, not just select one of four areas of a homogeneous
	address space.  Although banking makes SLAPSTIC slightly harder to
	work with, it more difficult to analyze and work around.  TETRIS is
	a recent example of banking.  It banks four 16K chunks into one
	16K address space.

2. The SLAPSTIC software should bank program and data, not just data.  The
	best way to use SLAPSTIC is if the program jumped from bank to bank
	within the banked address space.  Rivera and Avellar did this very
	well in EMPIRE, but this technique is tricky to implement.

Each project leader should verify that at least one, (preferably both), of
these items are included in every game.  Item 1 should be checked before
the PCB is released and item 2 before the final software release.

	(The following is a flame. Had it been an actual debate I'd
bury you with statistics and it would be much longer...) If you really
_like_ breathing smog and would rather never have a livable county just
delete this message now and save time and effort for both of us.

	I just can't let Gary Stark's petition and mail stand unchallenged.
Measure 'A' was sold to the voters by signs alledging (falsely) that the
money would be spent to solve "the 237 problem". In fact (and the fine
print of the measure) the express purpose of the measure was to fund the
extension of Hwy 85 into the Almaden valley so that developers could get
rich building condos on ex-open space and hwy 280 could get as jammed as
101 is now. I read the measure and voted against it. I lost, but I'm not
crying about it now. Stop and think about the insanity of funding road
construction _at_all_ with sales tax money when fuel costs are already the
most massively subsidized of any nation. What happened to "pay as you go".

	The automobile is already massively subsidized by the extensive
use of sales tax, income tax, depletion allowances artificially lowering
oil prices, etc. The highway system was _built_ partially with ticket taxes
levied on railroad (!) passengers. (The rest of the ticket tax money went
to build airports, not one cent went back to rail). In short, the auto
(and those who maintain their "right" to drive at our expense) has been
massively subsidized at the expense of other forms of transportation for
at least 50 years. The bitching and moaning when the rest of us get a
small piece back (in the form of diamond lanes built with a sales tax)
is ludicrous.

Subj:	Phones and Credit Cards   (Those with bulletin boards, please post)

	WARNING!	WARNING!	DANGER!!	DANGER!!

	I am sure we have concientious employees who arrange to pay for those
personal calls they are forced to make from work.  The most convenient way
is to use telephone company credit cards.  If you fall in this category,
this message is for you.

	There are a few things you should know.

	MCI is the normal carrier of all long distance calls placed through
Atari's phone system.  By itself, this is not a problem.  However, they have
recently started a moneymaking scheme that you should know about.  If you
dial as though to make a regular credit card call, using another carriers
card, THEY WILL PROVIDE THE "BONG" that AT&T callers are used to hearing.
If you then key in your credit card number (usually AT&T), they will honor it,
completing the call for you.  When you get your bill, you will find that you
paid four to ten times the going rate, and the charge is tacked onto your
regular AT&T bill through a cooperative service.  If you don't pay, AT&T loses,
and they generally blackball you and rip out your cord by the roots.  This
information, incidentally, applies to pay phones as well as Atari's system.
You should make sure of your carrier before giving the card number.

	Another nifty detail is that coin calls are cheaper, at least local
ones.  I have found through my own experience that what would have costed 20
cents in change can cost up to four dollars if you tell it your number.  I am
told that out-of-lata calls are cheaper by calling card, but infra-lata
calls are definitely not.  The lata we are in includes all of the 408
area code, all of 415, and most of 707.  If you are in these area codes,
(and I'm assuming that the phone your card is associated with is also)
you should pay coins to coin phones if you have the option.  If you are not
within these area codes, use the card; it's easier AND cheaper.

	One more tidbit is that (to the best of my knowledge) only AT&T has
long distance operators.  If you have trouble with a long distance call, if
it's not with AT&T, you just have to keep trying.

	The rest of this text is directions on how you can use your carrier
to place a credit card call.  It isn't necessary (or even desirable) to read
those that don't apply to you.

FROM INSIDE ATARI ON MCI
	DO NOT DIAL NINE.  Instead, dial the pound key, and 624 (pound MCI).
	Wait for the dial tone AFTER it goes through (you'll hear rings first).
	Next dial the number you want to call.
	Wait for the bong, beep or bell (definitely NOT a dial tone).
	Now dial your credit card number.
	Your call should go through; the charge will appear on your home bill.

FROM INSIDE ATARI ON AT&T
	DO NOT DIAL NINE.  Instead, dial the pound key, and 600.
	Wait for the AT&T long distance operator.
	You will have to explain that our antiquated system will not allow you
		to direct dial.  You may or may not convince the operator on
		the first try.  Ask for a station-to-station call (unless you
		want person-to-person).
	You will be asked for the number you want to call and your card number.
	You will be billed on your home bill for an operator-assisted call.
		Sorry, but that's the best we can do;  AT&T doesn't believe
		in these relay numbers that everyone else is using.

FROM INSIDE ATARI ON SPRINT (using a FONcard)
	DO NOT DIAL NINE.  Instead, dial the pound key, and 678
	Wait for the dial tone AFTER it goes through (you'll hear rings first).
	Next dial the number you want to call.
	Wait for the bong, beep or bell (definitely NOT a dial tone).
	Now dial your credit card number.
	Your call should go through; the charge will appear on your home bill.

FROM an OUTSIDE LINE ON MCI (on ANY telephone with a network-supplied dial tone)
	Dial 0, 10222, area code, exchange, extension.
	Wait for the bong, beep or bell (definitely NOT a dial tone).
	Now dial your credit card number.
	Your call should go through; the charge will appear on your home bill.

FROM an OUTSIDE LINE ON AT&T (on ANY outside telephone)
	Dial 0, 10288, area code, exchange, extension.
	Wait for the bong, beep or bell (definitely NOT a dial tone).
	Now dial your credit card number.
	Your call should go through; the charge will appear on your home bill.

	Optionally, you can just dial 0, 10288, and wait; an operator will come
		on the line, and you can explain whatever it is you want to do.

FROM an OUTSIDE LINE ON SPRINT (using a FONcard) (on ANY outside telephone)
	Dial 1-800-877-8000.  This connects you to the Sprint network.
		Any carrier must get you to any 800 number, free.
	Wait for the dial tone AFTER it goes through (you'll hear rings first).
	Next dial the number you want to call.
	Wait for the bong, beep or bell (definitely NOT a dial tone).
	Now dial your credit card number.
	Your call should go through; the charge will appear on your home bill.

TO DETERMINE WHAT COMPANY WILL CARRY YOUR CALLS IF YOU DON'T SPECIFY:
	(this only works on outside lines)
	Dial (700)555-1212	yes, 700.  You will get a (free) recording
		saying who your long distance company is at that time.
		This number is intended as a service for people who are
		changing carriers so they can tell if it worked or not.

IF YOU'RE STILL LOOKING FOR YOUR LONG DISTANCE CARRIER, I don't know how to do
	it yet, so let me know and we'll experiment.  I'll publish the results
	so everybody can learn how.

Subj:	More phone info


	In general Steve's memo was quite informative and accurate, but you
should note the following:

	Our LATA does _not_ include all of 408. Carmel peninsula and perhaps
as far north as Aptos are not included, but are (408).

	Inter-Lata calls _may_ be cheaper by credit card, but this is
totally at the discretion of the COCOT (Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephone).
Many (if not all) of these contract with an AOS (Alternative Operator Service)
for any billing, and apply a totally unregulated surcharge (300% is not
uncommon) for the "work" of forwarding your credit card number to your
LD carrier.

	ATT have the only "in-house" operators so far, but all the others,
to my knowledge, have contracts with AOS's to handle "operator-assisted"
calls. The surcharges range from annoying to extortionate. As a rule of
thumb, if you find yourself talking to an operator who does not specifically
identify him/herself as ATT, HANG UP or be prepared to pay through the nose.
Note also that these people are carefully trained to give the impression that
they work for the LD carrier you thought you were using without actually
stating it (which would be illegal).

	It may be legally true that any carrier must get you to any 800
number free, but it is not the case that any COCOT necessarily will place
the call. These leeches make big bucks by forcing you through their LD
carrier and AOS, and will desist only as and when forced to do so by
state attorneys general. At present about six states are looking into
the widespread abuses of COCOTS and AOSes but California is not among them.

	If you think this is bad, don't even _think_ about placing a call
from a hotel!

	Would now be a good time to suggest that the next time you run
across a COCOT, you inform the proprietor of the establishment that if
they do not value your patronage more than an extra quarter, perhaps
they can do without it?

The project has lost the services of Mike Hally.  Ed Rotberg has now 
assumed the responsibilities of Project Leader and lead Game Designer.

A mini-brainstorming meeting was held last week to discuss possible new 
game themes and goals.  This was in light of the almost universal feeling 
that while the game "looked" good, the play appeal was noticably lacking.  
As per that brainstorming session and the team meeting following it, a new 
direction for the game has been established.  A document describing the new 
direction has been written, including a somewhat detailed plan for the first 
three waves of the game.  This document has been distributed to those 
directly involved with the project.  If you are interested in a copy, 
please see Ed Rotberg.

In light of this change of direction, new dates have been established for 
the 4th Review, Field Test, Production Release, and FGA.  These are 
indicated above.  These dates were arrived at based upon a reassesment of 
the tasks that needed to be completed before the game would be ready for 
Field Test.

HARDWARE
The Rev. 2 MutiSync PCB is up and working with only one mod.  This is a 
component change in the SCUM circuitry requiring an 'F' part for the clock 
buffer.  We have abeen allocated one Rev. 2 board which we will probably 
use for the field test unit.  Jed Margolin has also been converting his 
Driver self-test to run on MultiSync standard speed.  This will be a great 
help to the project.

CONTROLS
Milt Loper has started working on cost reducing the flight controller.  
Current pricing gives the Namco plastic handles at $8 per set, but Milt 
reports that the reliability of these parts is questionable at best.  The 
tooled metal handles currently cost $40 per set.  Milt is looking into 
die-cast metal parts.  There is no cost projection on these parts but the 
lead time looks like 8 - 10 weeks including drawing time.  He is also 
looking into getting our own molded plastic parts from a new vendor that
believes they  can produce them with a lead time of 4 - 6 weeks.  The 
projected cost for these would be about $8 per set.  Milt is also going to 
look into getting the entire assembly costed by the vendor supplying the 
steering wheel stop mechanism for Hard Drivin' as they gave us an excellent 
price on that part.

CABINET
We are planning on using the Family Cabinet for Field Test.  Mike Jang has 
figured out a way to mount our board set and power supply in that cabinet.

GRAPHICS
As per the change in game design, much of the graphics for the game will 
need to be reworked.  A meeting was held Wednesday with the animators, and 
we will be supplying them a new prioritized list by the end of the week.

AUDIO
Much of the audio done for the game will be able to be used in the new game 
theme without change.  However, many of the voice cues will certainly need 
to be changed.  I will be providing a prioritized list of required audio to 
Brad and Don this week, but it will not include voice cues at this time as 
we would like to see how the game plays in its new guise before deciding 
what voice cues we need.  Brad says that lead time for voice may be as much 
as 2 - 2 1/2 weeks so that will be a consideration towards getting him that 
list as early as possible before field test.

SOFTWARE
As per my conversation with Rick Moncrief and Max Behensky, we will be 
getting Max and Stephanie's time between now and Teusday 2/21/89.  Their 
help is required for the following action items:
	1) Giving us the capablitiy to to BLIT objects both directly to the
	   screen and onto polygons (growth BLITs)
	2) Implementing a method to display the control panel using the 
	   "fast background" method.
	3) Implement vertical scrolling of the background.
	4) Give us the ability to modify a small subset of the color-map.
	5) Give us the ability to convert Fonts supplied by the animation group
	   to the format needed for the MultiSync system.
	6) Help us conform the Driver coin & stats package to our needs.

On a lower priority level, the animation group has requested that Max 
modify one of the 3D CAD systems to use a tablet instead of the mouse.

Additional software changes as per the new game design are under implementation
by Andy and Ed.  This will include designing the first 3 waves, and 
spending time tuning them.

Some returned much later...as late as 6:00PM...or 10:00PM ???. I was not
informed. If you report to me, THIS ISUNACCEPTABLE. You are expected to keep me
informed if you will be gone during the work day. Under the circumstances, I
can tolerate an extended lunch (say til 3:00PM?) but only if I am informed. Rob
Rowe left me a note. Did anyone else? Please let me know if you were gone 
and for how long. I would also like to know if you think you should make this 
lost time up, or if multi-hour farewell lunches are your inalienable right and
a company-paid benefit. Yes, you might say I am upset. I would appreciate at 
little more consideration from you guys.

If you are interested in a programmable device compiler then read on.

I have information packets for ABEL and CUPL. If you want to see the 
packets then let me know. I will send them out on a distribution list to 
anyone interested. I also have demonstration software for ABEL, CUPL 
and XILINX on the PC in my office, if anyone wants to look at them.

Here is a summary of the software.

We currently have PALASM2 and AMAZE programmable device assemblers in both 
DOS and VAX/VMS formats. These products are FREE from AMD/MMI and SIGNETICS
respectively. They are good for devices from those companies, and second
sources. e.g PALASM2 does not program AMD PAL18L8s, but this may have been
corrected since AMD bought MMI. AMAZE covers mostly FPLAs (IFLs). I have not
used a recent version of AMAZE so if someone knows of expanded capabilities
please let me know. 
Neither program works with some of the newer devices like EPLDs (ALTERA,
INTEL) and ERASICs. PALASM2 (DOS vesion only) can program state machines, and
has a simple MINIMIZER algorithm. 

PALASM2 and AMAZE are assemblers. The logic equation input is restricted to a 
strict set of rules that are determined by the device being programmed.

CUPL and ABEL are compilers. Logic equation entry is free format and device 
independent. Tables and state machine descriptors can be used as well as 
standard logic equations. Vectors and macros allow great flexability in both 
design specification and simulation. The same design specification could be 
used for a  PAL, PLA, GAL or EPLD. Design time with a logic compiler is
probably half that of an assembler. Debug time is probably half to one tenth 
depending on design complexity and use of the simulator.

Cost:
PALASM2 and AMAZE : FREE

ABEL : DATA I/O, Redmond, WA
ABEL on microvax : $3995, includes 1 year maintenence ($600 value)
ABEL under DOS on a PC : $2275, includes 1 year maintenance
ABEL version 3.1 ships in February

CUPL : LOGICAL DEVICES INC, Ft. Lauderdale, FL
CUPL on VAX (unlimited users) : $3495
CUPL on VAX (MAX 3 users) : $2495
CUPL under DOS single user : $1250
CUPL maintenance : $360 for 1 year, $595 for 2 years.
CUPL version 3.0 is "Upcoming" and will add the EP1800 from Altera/Intel and a 
few other new devices.

I am interested in getting either ABEL or CUPL, mainly because I want to 
prototype a custom chip using mainly programmable logic, and because I have 
used as many as 6 PAls in a production game and find PALASM2 error prone and 
cumbersome. I need feedback from the other engineers on their potential usage.
See the next mail message for a feedback questionaire.

Comparison of ABEL versus CUPL.
This is a transcript of an excerpt from a marketing newsletter dated 3rd
quarter '88. put out by EXEL who makes the 78c800 ERASIC. 

PLD Software: ABEL vs CUPL
Comparisons of the two most widely-used PLD design software packages, ABEL and 
CUPL, seem never-ending. In actuality, these best-known logic compilers are 
no longer in a two horse race.

Data I/O's ABEL is now, because of its recent enhancements (rev. 3.0), the 
industry's recognised leader. ABEL supports more manufacturers' devices 
(Altera, Cypress, Intel) and has improved its syntax, logic reduction and 
simulator. It has the ability to handle asynchronous or multi-level logic 
(such as ERASIC's) and configurable flip-flops, which include resets-presets.

CUPL, in direct contrast, is an orphan looking for a home. It was originally 
the property of Assisted Technology and in 1986 was acquired by Personal CAD 
Systems (PCAD). CUPL has since been sold to Logical Devices Inc. of Florida.

CUPL has not been enhanced in over two years and no enhancements are 
projected for the near future. Moreover, PCAD evidently did not provide 
Logical Devices with CUPL source codes, so when EXEL attempted to create an 
enhancement package for use with CUPL (similar to MultiMap/Multisim, our ABEL 
enhancement software), our efforts met without success.

ABEL is the only universal logic compiler that has made a long-term 
commitment to its original customers and to the established design 
community.

Jed,
	Ed Rotberg would like to have a vcr connected to STUN as soon as
possible. When you have time I need to have you show me the hardware mod that
needs to be installed on the main board. The document that will tell us how to
do this is [salwitz.vcr]vcr.doc. I have the video board and optical transmitter
that is mentioned in the document.
						Thanks,	Glenn.

HARDWARE
Glen has been bringing up the second moded Rev 1 MultiSync board as we have 
not yet received our Rev 2 board.  This board now appears to be up and 
running as well.  Glen is also adding the hardware necessarr to drive a VCR 
for Field Test.

CONTROLS
There will be a meeting today (3/2/89) at 2:00 PM to discuss the status and 
plans for the flight controller that we are planning on using.

GRAPHICS
The Animation Group has committed to a schedule for S.T.U.N. RUNNER 
graphics that will get us to Field Test as per the current schedule.  We 
have already received a lot of new graphics.  We have new bacgrounds, new 
tunnel segments, and a complete animation sequence for the player getting 
into the TTV at game start.

AUDIO
No work on audio at this time, as we are still evaluating our needs.

SOFTWARE
Max Behensky has been giving our project a lot of his time, and as a 
result, many of the action items have been completed. These are:
	1) Giving us the capablitiy to to BLIT objects both directly to the
	   screen and onto polygons (growth BLITs)
	2) Implementing a method to display the control panel using the 
	   "fast background" method.
	3) Give us the ability to modify a small subset of the color-map.
	4) Help us conform the Driver coin & stats package to our needs.

Other items specified on the previous list have been dealt with in other 
ways.  At present, we are only looking for an improved vector rendering 
algrorithm in the GSP, and our immediate needs from the Applied Research 
group will have been met.

Software changes to the game include:
	1) New opening animation sequence.
	2) Scrolling backgrounds (horizontally & vertically).
	3) "Glowing" hotspots.
	4) Cycles now enter from behind player.
	5) No Bonus time.

This next week we will be integrating and tuning the new game play in the 
first three waves.

Subj:	Atari Games granted preliminary injunction against Nintendo


MILPITAS, March 3, 1989 -- Atari Games and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Tengen, today were granted a preliminary injunction which prohibits 
both Nintendo America and its Japanese parent company, Nintendo Co. Ltd.
from suing retailers who carry Tengen products for infringement of
Nintendo's patent.

     Atari Games and Tengen's motion, granted in the United States 
District Court in San Francisco, was hotly contested by Nintendo.  The
injunction prohibits the video game giant from filing suit against
Tengen retailers until patent infringement disputes between the 
companies are formally resolved.  The court decision places similar
conditions on Atari Games with respect to its claims of patent 
infringement against Nintendo.

     The motion was filed by Atari Games and Tengen after they had
learned that several of Tengen's retailers, including some of the
nation's largest toy chains, had received letters from Nintendo's
outside legal counsel insisting that they immediately remove all
Tengen products from their shelves.  The letters stated that failure
to comply would result in Nintendo taking legal action against
retailers for third-party patent infringement.

     "Nintendo has tried to wage this battle on the retail front,
rather than in the court where it belongs," said Hide Nakajima,
Atari Games president.  "This decision takes the retailer out of
the middle, and places matters in the appropriate forum.

     "Nintendo's intimidation tactics have created fear and 
confusion among our retailers," said Nakajima.  "We believe this
decision represents the first step towards creating the kind of
fair, open market we've been seeking."

     The motion was filed in connectionwith the anti-trust lawsuit
filed by Atari Games and Tengen against Nintendo claiming monopoly,
wrongful business interference and patent infringement.

     Tengen is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Atari Games
Corporation and is headquartered at 1901 McCarthy Blvd., Suite 210,
P. O. Box 360782, Milpitas, Calif, 95035; (408) 435-2650.  Atari
Games is a privately held company, is not affiliated with Atari
Corporation, and should be referred to as Atari Games.

HARDWARE
Glen has added the circuitry necessary to drive the VCR from the MSYNC board.
We have hooked this up to the developement board in order to work out 
glitches in using the VCR as well as using the VCR to help debug the game.

Jed is starting to bring up our REV 2 MSYNC board.

CONTROLS
There was a meeting last Thursday (3/2/89) at which we discussed the flight 
controller, the current costs, and ways in which we might be able to reduce 
those costs in both the near term (i.e. for S.T.U.N. RUNNER) and in the 
long term.  See the Mechanical Engineering Status report for details.

CABINET
Mike Jang says that we should have a "Family" cabinet by one week prior to 
our scheduled Field Test.  This means we should have the cabinet by the 
scheduled 4th Review.

GRAPHICS
Graphics proceeding according to schedule.

AUDIO
Don has been given a new list of SFX for the game.  There is still no 
request for voice audio, as the phrases needed have not yet been determined.

SOFTWARE

Software changes to the game include:
	1) Added "inertia" in turns on the flats
	2) Added friction when touching the rails on the flats.
	3) Two new tunnel sections have been added.
	4) We have taken a number of passes at tuning the first two sections.
	5) Implemented a warp sequence to higher levels.
	6) Added the code to run the VCR under 68010 control.  This involved
	   rewriting the timing loops that John Salwitz had written for a
	   7.19 Mhz 68000 to work on a 8 Mhz 68010.  Thanks to Mike A.

This week we will be working on:
	1) Map and instruction sequences before each level.
	2) High Score entry for each level for each of four categories.
	3) Improved steering dynamics.
	4) Improved traffic routines.
	5) Tuning traffic/markers/hotspots into levels 3,4, & 5.
	6) Capturing game play statistics and associated display screens.

In attempt to try to keep up with my game schedule I am going to establish
"office hours."  This is to try to minimize the number of interruptions I
am experiencing on any given day and clump them all together at one time!
This is primarily directed at the RPM users group (audio), the ARIUM benevolent
society, the MO driver movers and shakers, and the PC haters club.

During these hours, I will be available for general consulting on any topic
I know (or don't know) anything about, and do my best to bash any bug that
has dared to show its ugly little head in any of the code I am responsible for.

However, if you have a question or a bug that is theatening a production
release, field test, or other IMPORTANT event and that needs immediate fixing,
you can still track me down right away (this has never been a problem up
till now!)

For now, I am setting aside 1:00 - 3:00 Tues & Fri as the times to nail me.
If I'm not in the office, I'll probably be somewhere close by (like in the lab).

	Rusty

P.S.  I don't expect (or want) everyone to just leave me alone and not ask
questions, this is primarly an attempt to try to get them all to happen at
once if possible.

P.P.S.  Madam Q has ordered me to state that this doesn't apply to anyone
needing me for anything having to do with "ThunderJaws."

	The printer room is a continuous disgrace.  Again, I've cleaned
up after others, thoughtless people who extract what they came for, without
paying any attention to the mess they leave behind.

	If you need to get a printout from the printer, fine.  But don't
rip yours out of a chain and leave the rest.  Nobody wants their printouts
looking like a used kleenex, or trampled from not hitting the basket.  If you
don't want to clean the mess, FINE.  Just don't make it any worse!  When you
leave the prior printouts wadded in the basket, whether they were that way
or you're just too damn lazy to fold the tail in after you snatch your
printouts, you are causing the very problem you think you're avoiding.  And
somebody else has to clean up the mess you should have quickly straightened, 
PLUS the disaster that will occur from the new listings that have nowhere to go.

	Now, not everybody does this.  Each of you already know if you qualify.
Many of us have a pretty good idea who the offenders are, even if they are
particularly careful to take the sheets before and after their job with the
identifying information.  (Q:  If you aren't doing anything so wrong, why are
you so careful to take these identifying headers and trailers?)  However,
the identities can be determined without the headers and trailers, and this
information could be made public, if that seems required.  We could also
arrange for your printouts to be saved til last, for example...Maybe we'll
take a poll over what to do about continued abuse...

	Incidentally, any printouts over two weeks old are encouraged to be
tossed by anyone who wants to.  They should be shredded, if there is any doubt;
just because they weren't picked up doesn't mean they're not sensitive.  A
quarter of the printouts in there were from 1988; it's a lot easier to find
your own printouts now.  And if you find that you printed something out, and
don't need it by the time you get to the printer room, please dispose of it.
There is a trash can and a shredding basket right there; it makes it easier for
everyone, including yourself.

	Also incidentally (co-incidentally?), a restatement of long-standing
policy:  IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SERVICE THE PRINTERS, ==> DON'T!! <==
Ask anyone in the computer group; we'll be ecstatic to show you how, and
would rather do it ourselves than have the guy after you complaining about
how the printer is screwed up (alignment, ribbon, paper jam) and that his
mail message was deleted as it was printed.  Of course, if you can do it
WITHOUT screwing it up, by all means, go right ahead.  We can use all the
help we can get.

                            Hardware Meeting 3/21/89
                                 J.Ray 3/22/89

         Attendees: Mike Albaugh, Chris Downend, Tim Hubberstey, Pat
              McCarthy, Glenn McNamara, Rich Moore, John Ray, Byron
              Sheppard, Doug Snyder, Gary Stempler.

         Byron Sheppard was introduced as a new hardware engineer in
         Brad Fuller's audio group. Welcome Byron!

         The latest 1 Meg EPROM info from TI is: They are not in
         production yet. Parts will be available in the summer for
         $18-20. They will not be cost-effective for us until early
         1990 when they should cost about $14.

         Pat McCarthy reported that he is 90% done with the schematic.
         He will be implementing most of the chip in TTL to keep the
         Thunderjaws project progressing. The expected size of the
         chip is 3000 gates. He is hoping to get the Priority and
         Shifter chips done for Tjaws as well, but is not sure yet if
         this is possible.

         Doug and Mike reported that they will probably be visiting
         Mississippi next week to check on the design of the ASAP
         chip. Proto chips are expected late May or June. The first
         two boards for the development system (Mother and 68000)
         should be ready in May. The next two boards will be the RAM
         board and the Pod board. The Analyzer will be wire-wrapped
         before it goes to PC. The ASAP development system will be
         packaged in a "baby AT" case due to its cost-effectiveness
         and readily available components (eg. power supplies). Mike
         is working on the software, and will need an AMS for the
         68000 development. The ASAP development system software
         committee has written the first pass report on what they
         would like to see in the system.

         Pat will be writing up a purchase req. for Data I/Os ABEL
         software for the VAX. This will be an upgrade from the PALASM
         software currently used.

         Pat will arrange a demo of Viewlogic schematic capture and
         simulation software for the PC.

         We then discussed moving towards the JAMMA standard edge
         connector. Chris gave a synopsis of the reasons Atari needs
         to move towards this standard: The only games that are
         selling now are blockbuster games (Hard Drivin') and kits.
         Upright games in the $2000 price range are just not selling.
         This change in the market demand requires us to adapt our
         games to the kit market. The kit market is dominated by the
         JAMMA standard.

         JAMMA PROS

              Increased kit sales
              Possibly increased whole game sales
              Economies of harness standardization:
                   Engineering
                   Manufacturing
                   Field service (test fixtures)

         JAMMA CONS

              Increased PCB costs
              Increased connection costs
              Increased FCC problems
              Reduced power supply capabilities
              Inflexible edge connections
              Reduced audio volumes
              Changes "Standard Audio" methods (increased engineering)

         Doug Snyder agreed to coordinate documenting the Atari JAMMA
         specification. This specification will cover:

              Edge connector pinouts
              Video timing, polarity, levels
              Audio levels
              Power supply requirements

         Byron Sheppard agreed to come up with a standard audio amp
         configuration (for use on JAMMA games) that is cheap and uses
         readily available components.

         We discussed monitor usage on JAMMA games. The JAMMA edge
         connector only provides for -CSYNC. However, Doug said that
         the kits he has seen also provide taps somewhere on the PCB
         for separate positive syncs. He suggested we do the same (as
         a minimum) on our boards (on Tetris, he provided a separate
         Atari standard monitor header on the PCB). We should also
         make sure that the monitors we will be using will accept
         -CSYNC. (Some monitors accept -CSYNC on both -HSYNC and
         -VSYNC terminals). We should NOT use (on our JAMMA compatible
         cabinets) monitors that only accept positive sync signals.

         Regarding current and future games:

              TETRIS and TETRIS cocktail are both JAMMA compatible.

              ESCAPE upright will not be a JAMMA cabinet.
              ESCAPE kit will have an adaptor board and minor mods to
              the SA audio board to make it JAMMA compatible.

              SKULL & CROSSBONES main board will be re-designed to
              incorporate the JAMMA connector. The SA II board (with
              minor mods) will mount on top of the main board and have
              connections only to the main board.

              Games beyond these were not discussed. I would presume
              that all games currently in development except for
              S.T.U.N. Runner will be converted to JAMMA.
              Incorporating the audio board onto the main board should
              be seriously considered for cost savings (keeping the
              software drivers as compatible as possible, however).

         Please let me know if you have any additions or corrections.

         John

For those of you who have been intrigued by the reports of
ROOM TEMPERATURE!!! fusion experiments by the two scientists
at the university of Utah, I have a limited number of copies
of a science times article from last week about the issue.
Considering the earth-shaking implications of the news, it 
is puzzling that there has been very little discussion of the
issue in the press, especially considering all the hoopla
afforded the recent advances in superconductivity.

It is also intriguing that the scientists who developed the process
felt they had to go public in such a big way.  They say that
a reporter in Utah was about to write a story about their
experiments, but I wonder if they were afraid of their discovery
being suppressed. With the extremely powerful interests who
will be effected by a potentially very cheap source of
fusion energy small, simple, and safe enough to be placed in
your car for propulsion or basement for heat, it would not
suprise me in the least that someone might try to prevent
the information from being released.  Fortunately, with
the current publicity, the cat is now out of the bag.
The technique is simple enough that you could duplicate it
in your kitchen, given the necessary heavy water and 
palladium wire.

Of course, the whole question is moot if the process doesn't work,
but given the solid reputation of the scientists involved, and the
relative ease of confirming that fusion is occuring (unexplained
energy release, presence of helium-3, presence of released neutrons)
I think it probably does.  The energy release is particularly
telling; they are claiming a 4 to 1 payback in energy ouput
versus energy input.  This should be impossible to miss, and
unless Drs. Stanley and Fleishmann are intent on throwing
their careers away, I'm sure they got it right.

Still think it doesn't work, and that the government has nothing
to do with what's going on?  News flash this morning:  The current
head of NASA is leaving his job to oversee the Utah fusion project!
See you on Mars in 1995, folks, in our personal fusion powered
spaceships.

Can you tell me how the assembly, AMP 821932-4, which consists of a housing
and a cover, are shipped?  Are the housing and cover in separate containers
or are they paired and partially assembled when received?

Jeff refuses to assign an Atari p/n if the housing and cover arrives in
separate boxes.

Other than part numbers, what is the difference between ordering one assembly
and ordering one each of the housing and the cover?

If you can't shed light on the way these are shipped, I will call Bob Grant at AMP.

Subj:	Oakmead-San Jose Land Sale


In April 1988 Atari Games purchased 15.62 acres in the Oakmead-San Jose
Business Park to build a new factory and a new office building.  The 
site also provided us with room to build another building to handle
future expansion.

Recently, the Executive Committee made a decision to sell the land, 
because it was discovered that much more management time than originally
anticipated would have to be devoted to the project to make it a success.
Further, the matter was complicated by the ongoing litigation with
Nintendo.  For these reasons, we believe it is better to continue
leasing our present buildings, as we have very good leases, and sell
the 15.62 acres.

In addition, we purchased the land at a rock bottom price, so we stand
to make a nice profit when the land sale is final.  We certainly can
use the money to grow our business with Tengen's.

If you have any questions on the land sale, please see your departmental
Vice President.

Subj:	SANYO DISPLAYS FOR ENG PROTO-GAMES


Several people have asked me about the problems they are having getting the
correct brightness levels on the Sanyo displays. After looking at several 
different displays, I have concluded that the samples we are receiving from
MFG are "RAW" units. As in they have not had the Black Level adjusted, and 
they have not been white tracked per Atari specifications. I recommend that 
on all future MTO's the requester specifies on the MTO that the displays 
need to be set-up prior to delivery to Engineering. It is important that the
displays used in game development represent the actual displays that will be 
used in the product build so that the correct RGB signal levels can be set
via the bias resistors on the video output circuits. It is very hard to set 
the Black Level on the displays once they are mounted in the cabinet, so the 
best I have been able to do on the field test, and show games is bump up the 
low end of the RGB outputs of the displays to compensate for the loss in the 
brightness range. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.

Subj:	MANAGEMENT CHANGES


Effective April 3, 1989, the following personnel changes were
made at Atari Games and Tengen.

Mr. Dan Van Elderen has been appointed Chief Operating Officer
and Executive Vice President of Tengen.  Mr. Randall Broweleit
will continue as Sr. Vice President of Tengen, reporting to
Mr. Van Elderen.  Mr. Broweleit will assume all the
responsibilities connected with sales and marketing.
Mr. Van Elderen will be responsible for the administration,
finance and engineering functions of the company.  As the Chief
Operating Officer, Mr. Van Elderen will also be responsible for
the overall functions of Tengen.

The aforementioned personnel changes were made in anticipation of
Tengen's annual sales expanding to potentially three to four
times it's current 30M.

Mr. Lyle Rains, ready for something new, is stepping aside as Sr.
Vice President of Engineering and his new functions within Atari
will focus on technological developments.  Atari Games expects
great contributions from Mr. Rains in this area.

Mr. Richard Moore has been promoted to Vice President of
Engineering and will be responsible for all engineering
operations.  His more than 10 years of experience in game design
and junior management certainly enables him to be a great asset
to Atari Games in his new capacity as Vice President.

Mr. John Klein has resigned from Atari for personal reasons.
Mr. Robert Sheffield has been promoted to Vice President of the
Finance Department and Chief Financial Officer of Atari Games.
Mr. Klein, however, will continue to serve as a consultant,
assisting us with his vast knowledge of finance.

Let's continue our strong support of this new management as they
address their new responsbilities and help lead our companies
toward future prosperity.

Bob Grant returned OUR calls.

He is checking on delivery (qty=500) and will have an answer by tommorrow.

Reason for price discrepancy of assembly vs cover & housing separately:

	Your pricing from C. Eppley in Pennsylvania is almost eight months old
	and the market conditions have changed since 8-17-88.

	The pricing that I gave you is today's pricing.

His office is checking on the condition that the assembly is shipped in and
will let me know how we will receive the cover and housing under AMP 821932-4.

If you wish anything more from him let me know.

The Fourth Review was held as scheduled.  There was a lot of good input on 
the game play and the team has started to implement some of those ideas 
already.  As per marketing's input, we have pushed back our Field Test date 
by one week, and the also the Production Release and FGA dates by one week 
as well.

It was decided to look into as deluxe sit-down cabinet version of the game, 
in addition to the upright version already planned. 

CABINET
The Field Test cabinet is being readied for Field Test.

SOFTWARE

Software changes to the game include:
	1) New Graphics have been added, including new title screen.
	2) New tunnel sections have been added.
	3) Continued to tune the game parameters.
	4) Added a new attract mode, a Scenario description that sets 
	   the tone for the game.
	5) Improved Enemy intelligence, and added a variable difficulty feature.
	6) Added new sounds to the game.

This week we will be working on:
	1) Capturing game play statistics and associated display screens as per
	   marketing input.
	2) Tuning all the waves on a time basis.
	3) Fixing bugs in readiness for Field Test.
	4) Adding 50 cents to start 25 cents to continue feature.

Stun Runner
-----------
In order to use existing coin software:

   1. The Coin Switches will be connected to the MultiSync Board instead of 
      to the SA II.

   2. One end of the Coin Counter will be connected to the Coin Counter driver
      on the MultiSync Board.
   
      The other end will be connected the CC1+ on SA II to pick up +14V through
      a resistor.

      Carole will find out if the Counter Counter has an internal protection
      diode. If it doesn't, she will put one at the Coin Counter Connector.

      Carole will add a power ground from SA II to the MultiSync Board to
      augment the ground in the SCUM Cable.

The Stun Runner current requirement from the +5 Volt supply is 7.5 Amps. Rick
Meyette assures me that tne +5 Volt 10 Amp supply is rated to supply 10 Amps
up to 50 degrees Celsius. Therefore, Stun Runner can use the +5 Volt 10 Amp 
supply.

I have obtained a series number for Stun Runner Programmed Parts.

I have received a memo on diagnostic test results from RPM. I need to know:

   1. What is the protocol for communicating to SA II?

   2. How do I call S_STAT?

   3. Is there a period after which, with no reponse, I can assume the
      SA II is broken?

   4. The Status bits indicate three ROMs (at 4000, 8000, and C000). The
      SA II schematic shows only one program ROM. If this ROM is good will
      all three ROM status bits be set or just one? If one, then which 
      one?  

   5. The situation for RAMs is similar.

   6. Does the SA II program deliver ROM checksums?

   7. Does the SA II test the ROMs connected to the MSM6295?

Jed,
	I want to let you know that the coin counter on the STUN cabinet is
connected the way you want it, and it seems to work fine. I didn't look at
the signals yet to see if any noise is injected into the MSYNC bd from the 
grounding method we use. I haven't noticed anything strange happen to the game
when the coin counter is activated, like resets that you were worried about.

	We have another monitor now. This one seems to be much better than the
last monitor, which was too dark.
	We also connected the development system to the game to look at the pot
values, and were able to zero the vertical aim pot with this data.

	The game seems to be working fine at this time.

Thanks,
	Glenn.

Subj:	GALs.. GALs.. GALs


PAL users and buyers read on.

I am recommending that Karen Bjornquest stock LATTICE GALS instead of PALs for
most applications in engineering. It may be beneficial to also use them in
production instead of PALs.

A GAL is an electrically erasable multifunction PAL. The G stands for 
GENERIC.
Basically there are three GALs : GAL16V8, GAL20V8 and GAL39V18. The GAL16V8
will accept the fusemap for a PAL16L8 and most other PALs in the 20 pin
series. They can be programmed with our current software and hardware. The
DATA I/O configures the GAL to look like the PAL you intended. You just enter
the GAL family pin/code. (The JEDEC file has the pal type you intended). The
GAL20V8 is a generic form of the 24 pin PAL series (8 outputs only). The
GAL39V18 is a generic form of the PAL22V10 and IFPLs (Signetics 82S153 etc.)
and includes user selectable latches or flipflops on the inputs and outputs
and 8 buried state registers. 

If you want the change the logic in a GAL, simply take the same device back
to the programmer and program it again. 

Available speeds are 10nS, 15nS and 25nS for the GAL16V8,
		15nS and 25nS for the GAL20V8 and 30nS for the GAL39V18

Costs / availability
Jerry Greiner, sales manager for Lattice and Joan Alpen from Merit 
Electronics (distributors) indicated that Atari could buy GALS for production 
(at least the GAL16V8-25) at the current going rate for PALs of $0.95 even 
though the the "street" price is around $1.40 
The Atari special on GAL20V8-25 would be around $1.60, (street price $2.25)
The GAL39V18 (soon to be renamed GAL6001) has a current price of around $9.00 
moving towards $6.00 by the end of the year.
For production purposes these parts can be programmed at the distributor, and 
should we need to change the program, or over-order a part, they can be 
returned to the distributor for reprogramming.

They have a definite cost advantage for engineering prototype development, 
since they are reprogrammable, and since we buy our PALs for engineering use 
at anything up to $2.50 at FRYs. Instead of stocking 16L8s, 16P8s, 16R8s, 
16R6s, 16R4s and 16RP8s, we could just stock 16V8s. 


Footnote. 
Lattice are developing a 2000-3000 gate LCA (XILINX look-alike) that will use
EEPROM technology for configuration instead of RAM as Xilinx uses.

Subj:	Monitor Stuff


Monitor Problem:

When I heard that the video output wasn't right, I assumed it was too low. 

Rick Meyette says the problem is that the Stun Runner board produces Too Much
video output voltage for the Sanyo Monitor. 

The way to fix it is to install the 3.3K resistors at R97, R108, and R112.
Heretofore they were not loaded in order to boost the video output.

With these resistors loaded, the maximum video output should be 3.0 volts.
If it isn't we will adjust the value of the resistors until it is.

There may be a problem with threshhold brighness values. To wit:

		Wells-Gardner		Sanyo
		-------------		-----			
Max Video	3.5 Volts (255 DAC)	3.0 Volts (255 DAC)
Gray		1.5 Volts (85 DAC)	1.5 Volts (102 DAC)
Threshhold	1.0 Volts (42 DAC)	1.0 Volts (51 DAC)
Min Video 	0.5 Volts (0 DAC)	0.5 Volts (0 DAC)


The Sanyo cannot be adjusted to work with Wells-Gardner video levels.
Meyette say the Wells can be adjusted to work with Sanyo levels. I suggest
we use Sanyo levels.

Let's plan on adding the resistors to a board and connecting it to a
Sanyo monitor. It may be necessary to adjust the gray levels in software.

Hard Drivin' Status Report
Date: April 13, 1989
Reported by Margolin


This week's top story, filed by correspondent Rick Moncrief, concerns the 
Atari Games Distributers' Show. Moncrief reports:

	"Things went well at the Show. There were favorable comments about both
	 the Sitdown and the Compact..... . There was some concern about the 
	 security of the cash box."

In local news, the problem with the Hard Drivin' Motor Amp has been addressed
and, with Erik Durfey's help, hopefully solved on this, the second attempt in
as many days.

A petition for an ECN will be filed after it has been verified that these new 
mods solve the problem.

CABINET
The Field Test cabinet is nearly ready for Field Test.  Kyoko should have 
the control panel finished today, and the attract plex by early tomorrow.

HARDWARE

We will be using a Wells-Gardner monitor for the Field Test as the Sanyo 
monitor was not compatible with the voltage levels output by the Multisync 
board.  We will address this problem sometime after Field Test and correct it.

SOFTWARE

Software changes to the game include:
	1) New Graphics have been added, including new title screen.
	2) Continued to tune the game parameters.
	3) Capturing game play statistics and associated display screens as per
	   marketing input, including backdoor for display of histograms 
	   without opening up the game.
	4) Added new sounds to the game.
	5) Added 50 cents to start 25 cents to continue feature and fixed 
	   all coin messages appropriately.
	6) Got the game into the common area.
	7) Got the VCR power detect working.
	8) Modified other games routines as needed for game play.

The elastic collisions are kind of unreal, especially when viewed alongside
the stunning realism of the rest of the game. But I don't understand
what you mean by angular momentum failing to be conserved. What symptoms
of driving off-road are you referring to?

No, cars in general have much lighter sticks and race cars in
particular have shorter "throws", that is a shorter distance from the
gear position to the neutral position. While this makes for quicker
shifts, your hand position and timing have to be more accurate. This, I
think, is the reason that the game is set up the way that it is. After
all, what's the use of an arcade game that can't be played by
gum-popping high schol teens who, for the most part, have never driven
before at all?

Also, I have seen that these games take a fair amount of abuse (the
shifter is a prime candidate for rough handling) and the shifter can
become even harder to use.

Really, the major strength of the game is the nearly complete realism of
the control inputs and the results that you see. I was amazed when I was
able to take what meager knowledge of performance driving such as I have
and apply it and see it WORK! No other driving game does this. I was
able to see places where I was failing, hypothesize about the reasons why
from a knowledge of cars and driving (not from a knowledge of the game's
workings), test my hypothesis in the game and prove it correct!


It's also major loads of fun to try all kinds of nasty things that only
fools would try in a real car, like taking the car to the top of the
loop and throwing it off, taking jumps at incredible speeds, and
generally driving to endanger.

Things to try:
(1) On the first turn of the stunt course, there is a barn with a cow
    standing next to it. Hit the cow.
(2) At the very start of the race, make a hard left turn as soon as you
    get the car started. You'll find another road there.
(3) The game does not keep you from driving the course in reverse. You
    can't get any extra time that way, but it can be used for general
    mayhem.
(4) Stragely enough, although the game allows you to drive almost
    anywhere, there is one place you can't drive. It causes a collision
    with an invisible object.
(5) Hitting different objects produce different sounds. Try hitting
    a sign post, another car, a building...

People who want more hints can send me mail. If enough people ask for
it, I'll post to the net.

This byte is reported to the master when S_STAT is called.

Since S_STAT is an EXCEPTion routine it is processed immediately.  The status

Subj:	Press release regarding litigation


For all Atari Games, Tengen and AOI employees, the following is a press
release that was sent out concerning the latest developments in the
ongoing litigation with Nintendo:

          ATARI GAMES FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST NINTENDO
     CHARGING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT ON SOVIET-DEVELOPED GAME

MILPITAS, Calif., April 18, 1989 -- Tengen Inc., the wholly-owned
subsidiary of Atari Games Corporation, filed a lawsuit yesterday charging
Nintendo of America and its Japanese parent with infringing Tengen's
exclusive copyrights in its new home video game, Tetris.

     According to the lawsuit filed in U. S. District Court, Northern
District of California in San Francisco, Tengen has the exclusive right
to manufacture and distribute Tetris cartridges for play on the Nintendo
Entertainment System (NES).  In a news release last week, Nintendo
announced plans to manufacture its own version of Tetris, which Tengen
alleges infringes Tengen's copyrights.

     Tetris is an internationally acclaimed home computer game
originally developed by two Russian computer programmers.  The game
tests a player's dexterity and spatial perception.

     
     According to the lawsuit, Tengen acquired worldwide exclusive
rights to Tetris in May, 1988 from Mirrorsoft, one of Europe's largest
and most reputable software publishing companies.  Mirrorsoft is a
subsidiary of London-based Maxwell Communications, one of the world's
largest communications conglomerates.

     
     Under the licensing agreement with Mirrorsoft, Atari Games has
been manufacturing and marketing the arcade version of Tetris since
February 1989.

     "We have an air-tight, iron-clad agreement with one of the
largest and most reputable publishing companies in the world which
gives us exclusive rights to manufacture and market Tetris for the
NES," said Hideyuki Nakajima, president of Atari Games.  "Nintendo
is aware of the validity of our licensing agreement, and has known
that Tengen intended to exclusively market Tetris since we announced
the agreement over a year ago.

     "Tengen had presented Tetris as a potential title to Nintendo
when Tengen was a Nintendo licensee.  Nintendo never questioned the
validity of Tengen's rights when the game was presented to them for
approval, and was quite aware of Tengen's plans to bring the game to
market," Nakajima continued.  "This is another example of the kind 
of harrassment we have been facing from Nintendo since we decided to
challenge Nintendo's monopoly of the video game market."  Nakajima
was referring to an ongoingbattle between Nintendo and Atari Games/
Tengen.

     In 1988, Tengen and Atari Games introduced the first independently
manufactured Nintendo-compatible game cartridges and Atari Games
simultaneously filed an antitrust lawsuit against Nintendo claiming
monopoly and restraint of trade.  That lawsuit was expanded in
February to include allegations of wrongful business interference and
patent infringement.

     Atari Games and Tengen subsequently were granted a preliminary
injunction prohibiting Nintendo from suing retailers who were selling
the Tengen game cartridges for patent infringement.

     Yesterday's lawsuit charges that Nintendo has no right to manu-
facture or distribute NES-compatible Tetris games, and that to do so 
would infringe on two Tengen copyrights.  The suit seeks declaratory
relief and monetary damages, and asks that Nintendo be enjoined from 
selling products which infringe Tengen's copyrights.

     Tengen is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Atari Games Corporation
and is headquatered at 1901 McCarthy Blvd., Suite 210, P. O. Box 360782,
Milpitas, Calif., 95035; (408) 435-2650.  Atari Games is a privately
held company, is not affiliated with Atari Corp. and should be 
referred to as Atari Games.

			SAD Board Self Test Procedure

1)	Do a WORD write to SNDRST ($604000).  This is alledged to reset
	both the SCOM chip AND the 6502.

2)	Do a BYTE read of RDCHAR ($600000).  This is the initial read of
	the port, it should be $FF, but if not keep reading unitl it is.
	A time out of 16 milliseconds is plenty long for this -- should be
	$ff almost immediately.

3)	Do a BYTE write to WCHAR ($600000) of $07.  This is the send status
	command.

4)	The 6502 should respond within about 50 microseconds with a value that
	can be read from RCHAR.  A time out of 16 milliseconds will be plenty
	long.  The following bits in the returned status byte indicate the
	corresponding problem.

	P1BAD = 080		;80 = 6502 program PROM bad
	P2BAD = 040		;40 = 6502 program PROM bad
	P3BAD = 020		;20 = 6502 program PROM bad
	R1BAD = 010		;10 = 1st (0000) RAM bad
	R2BAD = 008		;08 = 2nd (0800) RAM bad
	IRBAD = 004		;04 = IRQs not present
	YMBAD = 002		;02 = YAMAHA timed out
	MLBAD = 001		;01 = mainline not running

Note that P1BAD, P2BAD, or P3BAD all indicate a problem in the 6502 program
PROM.  This is probably for historical reasons.  I am told by Brad that there
is currently no way to test the validity of the four PCM PROMs.

STUN Runner went out on Field Test on 4/14/89 as scheduled.  We have been
receiving early results that indicate that the game times are too long, and
that some players are able to play through the game for their initial 50 
cents.  We have addressed these problems as follows:

	* Increased the difficulty of the game in the higher levels.  This
	  involved reworking the program so that the upper levels were not
	  necessarily exact repeats of earlier levels, allowing us to modify
	  the difficulty on a level by level basis.  We also increased the
	  Probot difficulty more at higher levels of game play.
	  
	* As there were considerable problems tuning the wave times, we
	  adjusted the game's time clock to run relative to frame time as
	  opposed to real time.  This made the timings more consistent, and
	  independant of how the display was changing, allowing us to tune
	  the wave times accurately.

	* Fixed a bug which did not allow the game Difficulty setting to
	  drop below the initial Difficulty setting (medium) with each
	  coin drop.  This made it so that the game did not get easier with
	  each coin drop as it was supposed to.  In addition to fixing this
	  bug, we also increased the effect from game difficulty.

A new version of the game, with these changes, was installed at the test 
location on Wednesday evening, 4/19.

There will be a meeting on Monday 4/24 to discuss a sitdown cabinet for STUN
Runner.

The elastic collisions are kind of unreal, especially when viewed alongside
the stunning realism of the rest of the game. But I don't understand
what you mean by angular momentum failing to be conserved. What symptoms
of driving off-road are you referring to?

No, cars in general have much lighter sticks and race cars in
particular have shorter "throws", that is a shorter distance from the
gear position to the neutral position. While this makes for quicker
shifts, your hand position and timing have to be more accurate. This, I
think, is the reason that the game is set up the way that it is. After
all, what's the use of an arcade game that can't be played by
gum-popping high schol teens who, for the most part, have never driven
before at all?

Also, I have seen that these games take a fair amount of abuse (the
shifter is a prime candidate for rough handling) and the shifter can
become even harder to use.

Really, the major strength of the game is the nearly complete realism of
the control inputs and the results that you see. I was amazed when I was
able to take what meager knowledge of performance driving such as I have
and apply it and see it WORK! No other driving game does this. I was
able to see places where I was failing, hypothesize about the reasons why
from a knowledge of cars and driving (not from a knowledge of the game's
workings), test my hypothesis in the game and prove it correct!

It's also major loads of fun to try all kinds of nasty things that only
fools would try in a real car, like taking the car to the top of the
loop and throwing it off, taking jumps at incredible speeds, and
generally driving to endanger.

Things to try:
(1) On the first turn of the stunt course, there is a barn with a cow
    standing next to it. Hit the cow.
(2) At the very start of the race, make a hard left turn as soon as you
    get the car started. You'll find another road there.
(3) The game does not keep you from driving the course in reverse. You
    can't get any extra time that way, but it can be used for general
    mayhem.
(4) Stragely enough, although the game allows you to drive almost
    anywhere, there is one place you can't drive. It causes a collision
    with an invisible object.
(5) Hitting different objects produce different sounds. Try hitting
    a sign post, another car, a building...

People who want more hints can send me mail. If enough people ask for
it, I'll post to the net.

The manager says several regulars have complained that the new version
is too hard...as we expected.  

Ed - One of the employees who is an avid player wanted to talk to you
about the game so he may call you today.  His name is Mike.

The arcade volume is certainly lower than in the past few months, however,
compared to this time last year, they are at least the same, if not
better.

Therefore, the collection on Stun is real strong for the current period.

Subj:	H.D Compact Shipment


When Ralph and the guys removed the front piece to clean the monitor on one of 
the H.D Compacts they are getting ready for shipment, they noticed that the 
monitor bracket was bent.

Nobody noticed it in the game. We were primarily concerned that it reach
Ireland in one piece.
 
The options were:

    1. Replace the monitor which would require mechanical time as well as
       electrical time to reverse the yoke wires and perform monitor setup.
       Erik isn't here today so I would have to do it. (It would take me longer
       to do it than it would take him, and apparently the truck is waiting.)

    2. Remove the monitor and ship it in a separate box.

    3. Not send the game today.

Ralph was pretty sure that the monitor bracket will hold together so we decided
to send the game as is.

The reason for this memo is so:

   1. You know what we did.

   2. You will alert Ireland that the monitor bracket is bent.

I assume we are sending it to Ireland so they can convert it to 220VAC 
operation.

The cabinet meeting held on Monday turned into a general marketing, 
pricing, and scheduling meeting.  While many options for the cabinet, and 
eventual pricing of the game were discussed, there were not a lot of hard 
decisions made.  What follows is a brief summary of of what was agreed upon.

Pete's group will design and build a sit-down cabinet for STUN Runner.  We 
will go to the market with this version first, as a high-end deluxe piece 
distributor price around $4995).  We hope to have a prototype for test in 6
weeks.  This version will feature a 25" monitor, and be designed to enhance
the STUN Runner tunnel theme with a sectional plex canopy.

We will explore the possibilty of a "compact" upright version that will 
also feature a 25" monitor, and be priced considerably higher than an 
"average" upright piece ($3495).  The idea would be to make it a "deluxe" 
game in the same sense that Hard Drivin' Compact is a deluxe game, and not 
worry about trying to meet a specific low-ball price to the distributor.

The idea of a low-end game with a 19" monitor that tries to get to the 
distributor for a lower price ($2995) has not been completely abandoned.  
At present, its feasability is questionable.

While I have not changed the Production Release and FGA dates on the above 
schedule yet, they will certainly change in the near future.  It is pretty 
apparent that with the sit-down cabinet, and the current release schedule 
of other games, that STUN Runner will probably go into production sometime 
in the September time frame.  This additional time will also be invaluable 
for the game-play development.

The Field Test unit has been further "tweaked" in response to the 
statistics that have been collected to date.  The player survey is 
scheduled for this weekend.  The first week's collections were very good.

Game developement continues.  We are adding new levels, and some new features.

We now have film and fab for ADSP II boards (expanded graphics memory space) 
(film at 11:00).  10 boards have been ordered.  Seven of these are slated for 
the STUN Runner project.  Thanks to Jed we also have a new, customized 
hardware self-test for the STUN Runner multisync board.

are unlucky enough to leave the road before the bridge and hit that sign/fence
on the left, your car goes into a wild state of rotation.  A similar effect
is observed when you fly off the banked section of the stunt track.

The funny thing is that you can't damage the cow! You'd expect little
(and big) bits of electronic beef to fly everywhere, but if you turn
around, the cow is still standing there!

>purpose in life?

This is a skid pad, I think. The purpose of a skid pad is to give you a
nice circular course that you can run at high speed. I think that you
use it like this: You run the course, increasing the speed of the car
until you can't keep it in the circle anymore. From the maximum speed
and the (known) radius of the circle, you can figure out the lateral
acceleration that the car's suspension can withstand.

Usually, you can find this figure for a given production car in the write-up
done by the more respectable auto magazines. The number is usually expressed
as a decimal fraction of the acceleration of gravity (G). For example,
a Chevy Corvette can withstand a lateral accelaration of about 0.95G
(95/100 of the accelaration due to gravity) without losing its footing.

I don't think so. What I was referring to is that while you can usually
leave the track for a short time and return to it, you can't use that
trick when it comes to the loop on the stunt course. If you try to go
around the loop, you will have a collision, no matter how carefully you
navigate the obstacles or how slowly you drive.

I think what you may be experiencing is the different tractions on the
different surfaces (asphalt vs. grass). Grass can't give the tires
nearly as much bite as the asphalt, which means that the car will tend
to understeer much more on grass than on asphalt.

The event on the dip/bridge combination is also tricky, but I think that
I have figured it out. I think that it is important that when you leave the
ground and when you hit it again at that jump, you must keep your wheels
straight. Otherwise, one of the front wheels may hit the ground first or
(if the wheels aren't straight when you land) the turn of the wheel may
yank the car around. I have found that if you line up the jump and keep
the wheels straight, that particular jump is much easier to do.

In general, there are some driving habits that we have from our normal
cars that work (more or less) in those circumstances but fail in
performance driving.

For example, when taking turns at high speed, the car is naturally
pushed to the outside of the curve. The first impulse is to correct the
drift with the steering wheel, but at the speeds that you are
travelling, this may cause total loss of control of the car. Instead,
plot a gentle arc through the turn with the steering wheel and hold it.
When the car begins to drift to the outside of the curve, release the
accelerator just a bit until the drift is controllable. Don't bre afraid
of using the oncoming traffic lane if it looks clear (but beware of
blind turns and hills). Don't slow the car so much that it doesn't drift
at all, just enough so that all four wheels stay on the asphalt.
Whenever possible, take the car through the widest arc possible in the
turn (because the wider the arc, the smaller the lateral acceleration
and the greater the speed you can safely manage).

Anyone else have any tidbits worth sharing?

SCHEDULE ISSUES:
----------------
While we have not changed the Production Release and FGA dates on the above 
schedule yet, they will certainly change in the near future.  It is pretty 
apparent that with the sit-down cabinet, and the current release schedule 
of other games, that STUN Runner will probably go into production sometime 
in the September time frame.  This additional time will also be invaluable 
for the game-play development.

Once we know what management's decision is on STUN Runner's placement in the
scheduled release of games, in particular, which games are going to AMOA in
September, the sooner we can supply an updated schedule.

HARDWARE ISSUES:
----------------
We are eagerly awaiting the new ASDP boards.  These boards will have more
graphics ROM sockets (see GRAPHICS ISSUES).

We have currently been alloted four multisync boards for development and
field test purposes.

ID ISSUES:
----------
Jess Melchor and Milt Loper are still working on a Family Cabinet version of
the upright STUN RUNNER (code:FC). This cabinet is not to be confused with
the proposed "fancy" upright we talked about at last week's cabinet design
meeting. The FC cabinet will be available early next week.  This cabinet
will be used if a deluxe cabinet cannot be ready for our next field test,
though we would prefer to go out with the deleuxe version.

                    GAME DEVELOPMENT STATUS             STUN RUNNER

Pete's group is currently in the design stages for the Deluxe STUN RUNNER
sit-down cabinet.  Via input from the marketing/sales staff, they are working
on several conceptual designs.  These designs include a high end deluxe
sit-down similar to the sectional plex canopy proposed last week and a smaller
streamlined deluxe sit-down.  They hope to have a proposal package prepared
by the end of this week and will set up a meeting (Monday??) to present these
new designs.

The 25" vs. 19" monitor issue still needs to be resolved.  Most likely a
mock-up for a sit-down will be created with the 25" monitor in order to
address the possible visual perception problems.


MARKETING/SALES ISSUES:
-----------------------
Jerry Momoda has received the player survey forms for the STUN Runner 2 week
field test at the Regency Game Palace.  He will be writting up a summary
report as soon as he finishes his current CyberII responsibilities.

Mary Fujihara and the sales staff have been discussing various cabinet and
monitor issues in order to help ID determine which route to take in their
conceptual design for the STUN Runner project.

SOFTWARE ISSUES:
----------------
New tracks have been designed by Andrew Burgess, Glenn McNamara, and Ed
Rotberg.  We currently have 12 unique tracks, the last 3 are still without
any traffic.  We hope to have somewhere around 20 unique tracks by the
next field test, with the capability to loop back on them for longer play
time.

We are currently designing new traffic intelligence for the various enemy
vehicles, particularly the flyiung vehicles.

A new game over sequence is being designed so that the player will be able
to see just how far the got on a track that they were unable to complete.

Sparks have been added to help the player recognise that they are scraping
against various objects.  Inparticular, when a player scrapes against the
rails in the flats or lands from one of the jump ramps.

We still need to address an END-GAME scenario. Some ideas that have been
proposed are: 1) a phantom driver race similar to "Hard-Drivin", 2) a
super-track with a T-Shirt give-away.  We would deeply appreciate any
additional ideas people would like to submit.

GRAPHICS ISSUES:
----------------
New object graphics have been received: 1) more 50' and 75' diameter tunnel
pieces, a shockwave (super-blaster).  There are more in the design stage.
Unfortunately we are currently out of object ROM space and will not be able
to add anymore objects until we get the new ADSP boards.

                    GAME DEVELOPMENT STATUS             STUN RUNNER

New station backgrounds have been supplied by Kris Moser and are currently
in the lastest version.

New outside backgrounds have been supplied by Sam Comstock and are currently
in the lastest version.

Will Noble is currently working taking more jaggies out of the STUN Runner
attract screen and hopes to have it available for us in the next few days.

AUDIO ISSUES:
-------------
No new audio at this time.  We still need to get together with Don Diekneite
and the audio group to discuss various voice and sound effects.

Another cabinet meeting was held on Monday, and the general consesus is now to
go with a "ride-on" type of cabinet, probably with the 19" monitor.  Two mock-
ups have been delivered to the STUN lab and hooked up to the game development
for evaluation tommorrow.

A meeting was held with John Ray, Jerry Momoda, Andy Burgess, and Ed 
Rotberg on Wednesday, to discuss the agenda for development.

We are currently unable to add any more object graphics until the ADSP II
boards are available.  Will is working on a new concept for the presentation
of the maps in the game.  Sam is working on the "ring-o-fire" weapon.

The "ring-o-fire" weapon has been added to the software, and is currently
always available.  We are still trying to decide on the rules for when the
player will receive this weapon, and how to visually indicate that he has it.
The "Momo" switch has been implemented, allowing the steering in the tunnel
to be the reverse of the way it has been so for.  This is set up on an option
switch so that we can evaluate this option fully.  The audio self-test has been
re-written.

The DATA I/O logic programmer is now upgraded to version 9.1 (it was at

several other companies making GALs (I didn't know that there were others), 
as well as a bunch of other newer programmable logic types.
We have 500 GALs in stock in engineering (25nS 16V8 variety).
A new wall chart is up showing family/pin codes.

If you are trying to program a GAL using a PAL jedec file (this is called
cross programming) you must supply the Data I/O with the RAL family pin 
code of the device you are emulating. (RAL is reconfigurable array logic.) 
This tells the Data I/O what configuration to use.

e.g. You have a Lattice GAL. You have a jedec file for a PAL16L8.

Give the Data I/O programmer the Lattice 16l8 RAL f/p code of 36/17 instead of 
the Lattice GAL f/p code of 36/55. That is all that is required.

The new chart does not give RAL numbers, but the old one does and the 
manual does.

Subj:	RADMOD update


RADMOD update:				5/18/89

MAJOR:
> ability to write files with 1024 cells (used to be 256).
> handles merging of files with different palettes.
> TARGA conversion produces a lot better results (better color reduction).
MINOR:
> cell chooser list function now displays "DONE" by cells already operated on
  (in case you forgot what you were doing).
> "destination cell #" (MOVE option question) now has a default reply (which is
  1st cell number after the last one in the output file).
> the  program no longer terminates if you enter "x" to cell chooser without 
  having selected any cells (it simply goes back to the menu).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Writing files with 1024 or 256 cells:
  The default output rad size is 256 cells, since this takes a lot less disk 
space.  If you want to have the output rad size be 1024 cells, either
-- use the OUTT (change output type) menu option and enter RADB (for RAD BIG) OR
-- start with a source RAD file that has 1024 cells.
If your output RAD file size is 256 and you try to write higher cells, you're
outta luck.

> Merging files with different palettes:
  This is a real messy situation.  When you're combining several RAD files,
(using the OPEN menu command) RADMOD will check each RAD file as you open it
to see if its palette agrees with the current palette.  If all the colors are
the same, then no problem.  Otherwise it's time for you to make a decision
about how you want to resolve this problem.  The unused palettes will be
listed on the screen.  Your options:
-- ignore new palette and use the original.
-- discard original palette and use new palette.
-- offset new palette (if there's room it can be relocated after the original 
   palette).  You simply enter the palette offset (1 to 15). The new palette
   will start at this number, and all the new pixels will be adjusted to point
   to it.
-- remap new palette to best matches in original palette and ignore sub-
   palette boundaries. Don't use this if you've got stamps that require
   the primitive 16 colors/subpalette.
-- remap new palette to best matches in original palette, but respect sub-
   palette boundaries.  This keeps colors within their original 16 color
   subpalettes.
-- try 3 things in indicated order, respecting subpalette boundaries: 
   1> remap new subpalettes to identical original subpalettes.
   2> remap new subpalettes to black (unused) original subpalettes.
   3> remap new subpalettes to closest original subpalettes. 
   This last option is the RECOMMENDED one.
   (A subpalette is a set of 16 colors, starting at color 0,16,32,48,64,80...)

Another wrench has been thrown into the control issue.  A "new" Slider control
was tested, and many feel it is clearly the superior control.  By the same 
token, many feel that it is seriously worse, not better.  We are planning 
on Focus testing the two controllers with the hope of getting some unbiased 
feedback on this issue.

The ADSP II board has been delivered, stuffed, and is being tested.

Graphics developement continues.  We have a new Map screen, and are trying to
speed up the decompression routine in order to make it fit seamlessly.

Software development continues.  Unfortunately so much time has been spent 
on things like the cabinet and the controller issues that we are falling 
behind on the tunnel design.

Subj:	Intermetrics Librarian


	For the upcoming Asap development system, I am going to need at least
_some_ of the functionality of the Intermetrics librarian. Being nearly 100%
non-Intermetrics, I'd like to replace the *&^%%% thing. I assume that there are
others out there with similar feelings. I need the ability to add "asap" object
modules without it croaking and would like it to handle .ob (or .obj) as well as
.ol formats. The add/delete/update could be much cleaner too. Now here's where
_you_ come in. Please reply to this message if you use the librarian, or would
if some particularly annoying bug were removed. Please let me know _how_ you use
it, so I can implement it the way we use it, rather than blindly mimicking their
somewhat strange commands. 

	Remember, "Qui tacit, consentit", which means, roughly: "We'll just tack
this here consent form to your forehead, if'n you have no objections..."

The "Focusing" of the two controllers was done yesterday, and Jerry has 
collected the questionaires.  Hopefully we will have some definite 
direction from this input.

The graphics decompression algorithms have been rewrtitten in assembler in 
order to spped up the decompression of backgrounds (thanks to Mike A. for 
his assistance).  The code really screams now and as a result, the new map 
screens which look a lot better can be used.

We are planning on swithcing over to the ADSP II board today or tomorrow 
and will be adding new graphics as a result.  This may have to wait because 
of further control testing, or because we need some of Max's time to 
implement the banking required with the new scheme.

The Audio group has been given a list of voice cues to implement.

The new Galaxy background has been added to the game and looks great, as 
does the latest title screen.  The first run of the Ring-of-Fire graphics 
has been done.

Subj:	Atari Games and Tengen v. Nintendo

On Thursday, May 25, we were successful in opposing a temporary
restraining order sought by Nintendo to prevent the sale of our Tetris
cartridges.  The press release we issued as follows:

         COURT DENIES NINTENDO RESTRAINING ORDER;
           TENGEN REASSERTS RIGHTS TO "TETRIS"

MILPITAS, Calif., May 26, 1989 -- Judge Fern Smith of the United States
District Court in San Francisco yesterday denied a motion by Nintendo
to temporarily restrain Tengen Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Atari Games Corp., from distributing its independently manufactured,
Nintendo-compatible version of the video game "Tetris."

     "Tetris," a highly popular video game developed by two Soviet
computer programmers, has been the object of an ongoing legel battle
between the companies over who owns the exclusive rights to distribute
the game for play on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

     In her ruling, Judge Smith stated that "Nintendo has failed to
meet the high standard necessary for this Court to grant the relief
requested.  Although Nintendo claims that it has the exclusive rights
to the 'Tetris' video cartridge, the moving papers fail to fully
support this claim.  Further, Nintendo has failed to show that it 
will be irreparably injured by allowing Tengen to meet its existing 
commitments."

     On June 15, the Court will hear motions by both Tengen and
Nintendo, in which each will seek to enjoin the other from selling
its "Tetris" cartridges.

     The request for a temporary restraining order accompanied
Nintendo's response to a Tengen copyright infringement lawsuit
filed in April.  The lawsuit was filed after Tengen learned that
Nintendo was claiming it had negotiated the rights to "Tetris"
on the NES from the Soviet Foreign Trade Association, Elorg.

     According to Tengen, however, exclusive rights to "Tetris" 
for play on the NES and other computers had previously been granted
by Elorg to Andromeda Software Ltd., a London-based software 
company.  Those rights were transferred to Mirrorsoft, a U. K.
subsidiary of Maxwell Communications, one of the world's leading
publishers.  Tengen acquired the exclusive rights to develop and
market an NES version of the hit game from Mirrorsoft in May 1988.

     Atari Games released its highly successful arcade conversion
of "Tetris" last February.  Tengen began taking orders for its
NES-compatible "Tetris" cartridges at the Consumer Electronics
Show in January 1989 and began shipping the product earlier this
month.  "Tetris" is currently available in retail outlets 
nationwide.

     Tengen is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Atari Games
Corporation and is headquartered at 1901 McCarthy Blvd., Suite
210, P. O. Box 360782, Milpitas, Calif. 95035; (408) 435-2650.
Atari Games is a privately held companyy, is not affiliated with
Atari Corporation and should be referred to as Atari Games.

The schedule above now reflects our current plands to have Finished Goods 
by mid-Spetember.

The controller survey was completed and we will be using the Star Wars 
controller as originally planned.

Max Behensky will be working on a change to ADSP code to help us deal with 
the controller response problems.  Hopefully he will be able to get this 
soon, but it will not be until after Compact HD release.

We have swithced over to the ADSP II board and it works as advertised -- 
Thanks to Jed M.

Currently plans include:
	* Getting game out to common area 6/12/89
	* Finishing end-of-game map sequence to show how far player got.
	* Adding Ring-of_fire weapon into the game play
	* Re-laying out the levels and re-tuning them in order to introduce
	  the different enemies more slowly.
	* Adding more "personality" to the flying enemies.
	* Giving bonus points for each shield piece left at end of level
	* Awarding one new shield piece, if needed, after successful
	  completion of a level.
	* Try to emphasize intermediate goals.
	* Add new audio.

Subj:	ABEL is running.


Abel is up and running. Here is what you need to know and do.

Create a source file with a .abl extension. 	eg. GALS.ABL
Many examples may be found in ABEL$ROOT:[EXAMPLES], including one called 
gals.abl. I have the manual with full syntax and execution details.

Before you can do any compiling you need to do :	@ABELEXE:ABEL_LOGIN
Put this in your login or wherever you want, or define a shorter symbol for it.

Then to process your source file do : 	ABEL your_source_file
eg. ABEL GALS		Leave out the extension. You can put optional 
switches after the filename. There are restrictions on the computer node that
this can be run on. Read on. 



ABEL (a symbol for @ABELEXE:ABEL.COM) runs PARSE TRANSFOR REDUCE FUSEMAP 
SIMULATE and DOCUMENT programs using default options and settings. Use 
ABELMAN to find out what these are. See below.

The Abel copy security check is embedded in FUSEMAP and SIMULATE only. These 
programs must be run on a microvax II such as BERT, SANDY, or ICY. However 
you can PARSE, TRANSFOR and REDUCE on any computer (eg GAWD). FUSEMAP is the 
program that generates the JEDEC file so you have to do that sometime before 
you try burning the device. You can copy ABEL.COM from ABELEXE: and hack it 
so that the repetative task of parsing can be done on whatever computer you 
want and then submit the fusemap and simulate portions to one of the 
microvax_II queues when you are ready. You may want to adjust the default 
reduction level anyway from 1 (simple) to 2 (best for PALs). By the way, if 
you are interested in logic reduction, ABEL can use both PRESTO (three 
levels) and ESPRESSO.


Here are some more useful commands:

ABELMAN program		displays on your screen a text file about 'program' 
where 'program' can be any of : ABEL ABELLIB DOCUMENT ESPRESSO FUSEMAP IFLDOC 
JEDABEL PARSE REDUCE RFILE SIMULATE TOABEL TRANSFOR
Any of these can be printed by printing ABEL3DEV:'program'.1
The ABELMAN program consists of the one line :
type /page abel3dev:'p1'.1

FINDDEV device		searches for 'device' in a master file of devices. 
This is a simple DCL SEARCH of ABEL3DEV:DEVICES.TXT. By the way, this file
includes family/pin codes for all devices (except RALs for some reason) so it
is useful when you actually burn the device. 
The FINDDEV program consists of the two lines :
write sys$output "MFG       Part               Type  Package  F/P Code    Device"
$ search abel3dev:devices.txt 'p1'


EZSIM source_file 	executes PARSE TRANSFOR and SIMULATE with doing any 
reduction, fusemap or document.

CLEANUP 	cleans out all ABEL files except source codes from the current 
directory. 
The CLEANUP program consists of the one line :
$ delete *.tm%;*,*.out;*,*.jed;*,*.sim;*,*.lst;*,*.doc;*,*.p8%;*,rfile.*;*


Note ABELEXE, ABEL3DEV and ABEL$ROOT are system logicals.
Here is the text of ABELEXE:ABEL.COM

Finished end-of-game map sequence to show how far player got.  Added 
shock-wave weapon into the game play.  Re-layed out the levels and  we will 
be re-tuning them in order to introduce the different enemies more slowly.
We are now giving bonus points for each shield piece left at end of level 
as well as awarding one new shield piece, if needed, after successful
completion of each level.  We are also adding an initial level select screen.

The animation group has given us new graphics for the shcok-wave, an "energy
splash" against the player's car for when it is hit by a Probot shot, 
satelites for the space wave, and all the new maps we could ever want.

The audio group has been getting our voice cues digitized, and shoudl be ready
in plenty of time for the upcoming Field Test.

We should have the prototype "ride-on" cabinet sometime around 6/30.

	The not ethat this is sort of a reply to was pretty much more
of the same, so I didn't save it. This one brings up the "mystery spot"
which I think I've seen mentioned before. Would any of you care to elaborate
(to me, not the net)?

Dude, you got ripped off.  Come to Oregon State University, visit the 
Rec Center, and you can play all the Hard Drivin' you like for 50 cents 
a pop.
 
So it's a little far to travel...  It's worth saving half your income, 
right?  :-)
 
My only complaint with the game is that, occasionally, after landing on 
the other side of a hill at just the wrong angle, the simulation enters 
the Twilight Zone, and the scenery flies by wildly for about 10 seconds 
before the car finally "crashes".  The instant replay shows the car 
doing something pretty crazy, such as spinning on one corner of the 
front bumper.  <sigh>  If they could fix that, it'd be *perfect!* :-)

Subj:	New Celprocess


A new version of CELPROCESS is now in [PPS.UTILITIES]CELPROCESS.EXE.  This
version has two new formats for the NES system.  They are similar to the older
formats 3 and 4, except they output NES color tables and output the CEL data
run-length encoded.  The new format types are

	/FORMAT=5	- NES decimal byte .MAC file output
	/FORMAT=6	- NES hex byte     .MAC file output

There is also a bug fix applied to horizontally flipped, optimized cels which
have enough non-zero data so they don't actually get reduced in size.  The
horizontal offset of these cels was not being calculated correctly, and now is.

Let me know if any problems occur with this new release. (version 1.63)

Subj:	EEPROM, Flash EEPROMs....an idea...


The programmers are always gripping about the logjam at the EPROM programmers.
What if...Game PCBs (at least the pre-production revs) supported EEPROMs
or flash EEPROM's and the programmers could download and "burn" EPROMS right
in their game PCB, and then erase them there too. 

Another alrenative has already been prototyped by Doug and is in use on
the G1 hardware: Doug designed a aux PCB full of SRAM that exists in
the memory map of the processor AND the game graphics space. Programmers
can then download graphics just like program with this scheme. Doug may
want to give us a quick report on the results of his two protos.

Any comments?

The following press release was issued by Atari Games and Tengen
on Friday, June 16:

         COURT HEARS TENGEN AND NINTENDO TETRIS MOTIONS;
                        RULING DUE JUNE 21

MILPITAS, Calif., June 15, 1989 -- Judge Fern Smith of the United
States District Court in San Francisco said today that she will rule
on cross-motions for preliminary injunction filed by Tengen Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Atari Games, and Nintendo against the
sale of the popular Russian-developed video game Tetris by Wednesday,
June 21.  In the interim, both sides voluntarily agreed to refrain
from shipping Tetris cartridges until the court has made its ruling.

     Both Tengen and Nintendo filed cross-motions last month, in which
each side is seeking to enjoin the other from selling Tetris for play
on the NES.

     Tengen is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Atari Games Corporation
and is headquartered at 1901 McCarthy Blvd., Suite 210, P. O. Box 360782,
Milpitas, Calif. 95035; (408) 435-2650.  Atari Games is a privately
held company, is not affiliated with Atari Corporation and should be
referrred to as Atari Games.

	To Those of You Who Can't Get Enough of this Computer Games Business
		At Work and Own Computers of Their Own So They Can Play Games
		At Home, Too,

	I received a postcard from a company called Products Plus last week,
telling of a big Sale of theirs, so I went to look this weekend.  The thing
most worth mentioning is a stock of Firebird/Rainbird (makers of Starglider
and Carrier Command, among others) games they have.  They have titles for Mac,
Apple II, Commodore 64, IBM, Amiga, and (largest selection of all) Atari ST.
These games (mix and match as you like) are:

			$2.59 each or 5 for $10 !!!
			===========================

	They only have Carrier Command and Universal Military Simulator (2 of
their biggest) for the ST, but they have Starglider for several machines and
illustrated text adventures (The Pawn, Jinxter, etc.) and a few other games.
	They also have some other Mac software and modems (I don't know prices),
IBM shareware, disk boxes, bulk 3.5" (DSDD, w/ labels, 25/pack) @ $.65 each,
bulk 5.25" (DSDD, 25/pack) @ $.23 each, and other stuff.
	Some of the prices are only good for the sale (thru 6/24).

	Products Plus
	800-544-3472/408-727-9048
	3350 Scott Blvd., Ste. 1903
	Santa Clara, CA  95054

	From Atari Games:
	Take 237 West to Great America Parkway.  Turn left on G.A.P., go past
Great America and over 101 (G.A.P. becomes Bowers as it crosses 101).  2nd
light after 101 is Scott.  Turn right, go through 1 light to Garrett.  U-turn
at Garrett, then take the next driveway on the right (into Koll-Oakmead
complex).  Products Plus is on your left.

It sounds good to me.

Intel makes flash EPROMs that require +12 Volts for programming.

Texas Instruments is supposedly working on flash EPROMs that require only
+5 Volts. 

In Hard Drivin' the only memory not supported by RAM is the Sound Data ROM.
Everything else uses either emulator memory, has internal RAM like the GSP VRAM,
or has an optional external board like the 1 MB Program RAM board or the 
ADSP Graphics RAM Board.

Missed last weeks status report... oops, sorry!

STUN Runner is at Milpitas Golfland, and has been Friday (6/16) afternoon.
We have made these minor modifications to the game twice since that time:

	* Put in a "teach" function that allows us to freeze the game and 
	  display a text message on the screen -- such as when we detect the 
	  player riding on the wrong side of the tunnel in a curve.

	* Adjusted the time limit on Level 16.

	* Updated some graphics including showing boost pads in the maps.

We are currently working on adding new tunnel sections, and improving enemy 
variety, especially with the flying enemies.

We have PCB sets for the two "ride on" cabinets.  Glenn is in the process 
of assembling the board sets and readying each for Field Test on 7/7/89.
One set has been given to Carole Cameron.

The date for the "earnings" Field Test with the ride-on cabinet had to be
slipped as the fiberglass prototype for the control panel (vacu-form) piece 
will not arrive in time to have the cabinet ready for 6/30.  As the next 
week is a 3-day week, we have changed the Field Test date to 7/7.

There will be a meeting today (6/22) to go over cabinet graphics concepts.

The following press release was issued yesterday by Atari Games
and Tengen:

            TENGEN REASSERTS RIGHTS TO SOVIET VIDEO GAME;
       INJUNCTION HAS NO IMPACT ON POPULAR TENGEN PRODUCT LINE

MILPITAS, Calif., June 21, 1989 -- Tengen Inc., the wholly-owned
subsidiary of Atari Games Corporation, reasserted its claim to the
popular Soviet video game, Tetris, despite the awarding today of a
preliminary injunction against Tengen.

    Judge Fern Smith of the United States District Court in San
Francisco issued an order prohibiting further distribution by
Tengen of the Tengen-manufactured Nintendo-compatible version of
the game pending the outcome of litigation currently before the
Court between Tengen and Nintendo regarding the ownership of the
Tetris video game rights.

    "Tengen believes it has legitimate rights to Tetris," said
Dan Van Elderen, Tengen chief operating officer and executive
vice president.  "We have a valid and binding agreement for 
Tetris which we believe will be upheld in the Court's final decision.
While we are disappointed that we must temporarily refrain from
shipping additional Tetris cartridges, we are confident that we
will eventually prevail."  Tengen has been distributing its 
highly popular NES-compatible version of Tetris since early May.

    The Tetris matter is one of many legal issues between Tengen
and Nintendo, and is completely separate from the $100 million
lawsuit filed by Tengen against Nintendo last December.  That
complaint concerns larger issues such as Nintendo's alleged
monopolization of the home video game industry, its wrongful
business practices and Tengen's rights to manufacture and
distribute its full line of Nintendo-compatible products.

    "This preliminary decision over Tetris is not related in
any way to the other, more significant charges facing Nintendo,
and has no legal affect on our ability to manufacture and 
market our other Nintendo-compatible titles," said Van Elderen.
"Tengen products have been extremely in demand and well received
by both our consumers and our dealers.  We willl continue to 
provide our customres with the highest quality home video games."

    Tengen is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Atari Games 
Corporation and is headquartered at 1623 Buckeye Drive, P. O.
Box 360782, Milpitas, Calif.; (408) 435-2650.  Atari Games is
a privately held company, is not affiliated with Atari
Corporation and should be referred to as Atari Games.

Rich has asked us to put together a list of long-lead ( > 6wks )
parts for STUN Runner. 

  Carole is working on the cabinet, controls, etc. 

  Jed -- can you mark up Rick's list of Hard Drivin's long-lead 
  or common parts with STUN? 

Please have these lists (with cost estimates) to me by Thursday. 

Ed -- Rich also reminded me that your program must use SLAPSTICK
so customers cannot convert a Hard Drivin' Multisync to a STUN
Multisync. It should be in a socket. This needs to be done
before the first game is shipped to a customer (pre-prod?). 

Thanks!!

Re: STUN RUNNER Parts that are common with Compact Hard Drivin'
Dt: 6/27/89


ADSP II
-------
We have ECNed Hard Drivin' and Compact Hard Drivin' to use ADSP II
on the next buy. Therefore, ADSP II is common to Hard Drivin', Compact
Hard Drivin', and Stun Runner. (Stun Runner will presumably make use of
the two extra ROM sockets.)


MultiSync Board
---------------
  1. Stun Runner uses a 40 MHz oscillator module at XOSC4 instead of the
     32 MHz unit that Compact Hard Drivin' uses. Oscillator modules frequently
     require several weeks' lead time.

  2. To reduce costs the Timekeeper will be replaced with another ZeroPower RAM.

  3. Slapstik 17 was reserved for Hard Drivin' but not used. I assume it is 
     available for Stun Runner.

  4. There are several parts that Compact Hard Drivin' uses that Stun Runner
     does not.

     The following are not used on Stun Runner

   	5 	137540-150    1 IC, 48T02-15, RAM            200E

   	8 	137543-001    1 IC, 68681         	     200A

  	46 	137580-001    1 IC, 4066B                    205B
  	47 	137546-003    4 IC, 4464, 64K X 4, DRAM      5K,15K,25K,35K

  	83 	136068-1135   1 IC, PROM, 82S123             195U

  	84 	137403-001    1 IC, MC1488                   210A
  	85 	137263-001    1 IC, MC1489AL                 210B

  	89 	137614-001    1 IC, AD711KN                  15B 

 	136 	144000-011    1 XTAL, 3.6864, STANDUP        XTAL1

 	138 	144008-005    1 XTAL, 50 MHZ, OSCILLATOR     XOSC3

	miscellaneous other ICs, connectors, resistors, and capacitors

									2 of 2

  5. There are a few parts that Stun Runner uses that Compact Hard Drivin'
     does not. They are:

	137526-001	1	IC, SCUM		175W

	137484-001	1	IC, AS08		175T

	137134-001	1	IC, 74LS245		175R

	144008-004	1	Oscillator, 40 MHz	XOSC4

	137412-117	1	Slapstic 17		200K

  6. Parts with changes in quantities:

   	137538-002    IC, 34010-50    		Uses One instead of Two

	179237-068    SOCKET, 68 PIN  		Uses Two instead of Three

  	137442-150    IC, 48Z02-15, RAM 	Uses Two instead of One


I need Ed to tell me that the special board I had made up for him works, so
I can give Art the schematic, so we can get an official Stun Runner parts list.

STUN Runner is still at Milpitas Golfland, and has been giving us good feedback
on gameplay changes.

Software changes include adding "kamakazi" intelligence to the HoverBot, 
another new level (19 in all now) has been added, reworked the opening 
animation sequence to tie into the "ride-on" cabinet theme.

In addition, we are continuing to tweak the game play as per input from 
field test.

Max Behensky has been working on improving the vector mode of the GSP and 
has also been improving overall performance for us.  Stephanie Mott will be 
making changes to the ADSP code to help us improve control response time 
when she is fully recovered.

Will has been supplying us with the graphics for the new opening animation 
sequence, and Kris Moser has been giving us new Depot backgrounds.

We are anticipating new audio including a new music track as well as some
additional voice and sound effects.

The fiberglass prototypes for the seat and control panel have both arrived 
and they look "excellent!"  A meeting was held this week to review cabinet 
graphic concepts, and Kyoko is in the process of reworking the concepts as 
dictated by that meeting.

We should be able to make the "ride-on" cabinet field test date of 7/7 
comfortably.

"Th-th-that's all folks!"

Subj:	Product Bonus plan changes


!!!!!!!  THIS IS CONFIDENTIAL: ATARI EYES AND EARS ONLY !!!!!!!!

There are two changes in effect on the bonus plan - Rich asked that
we mention these verbally since it will be a while before the changes
are published:

	1) Previously, the cap on overhead was $325; now it is $350.
	   Additionally this applies to "Standard single display games".
	   For games like 4-player Cyberball there would be no cap on
	   overhead; instead the standard overhead rate would apply fully
	   when calculating profit. Games like Compact Hard Drivin and
	   Stun Runner are likely to be treated as "non-standard" although
	   a final decision has not been reached as near as I could tell.
	   For reference, the standard overhead on Cyberball was $353.
	   The standard overhead on Escape is $325.50 derived from
	   4.34 hours of labor times the new $75/hr overhead rate.

	2) In games (like coin-op Tetris) where the 
	   implementation existed previously, and the coin-op game is a 
	   conversion of a pre-existing game, then there is a cap or 
	   maximum on the bonus pool of $240,000. Additionly the funding
	   percentages are different - they are 3% and 6% as opposed
	   to 4% and 7%. As I recall the profit levels are the same, i.e.
	   0% for the first $500,000, 3% between 500,000 and $3,000,000, and
	   6% above $3M up to the 240,000 cap.

!!!!!!!  THIS IS CONFIDENTIAL: ATARI EYES AND EARS ONLY !!!!!!!!

Subj:	Hardware Meeting 6/26/89 Summary


                            Hardware Meeting 6/26/89
                                 J.Ray 6/29/89

         Attendees: Chris Downend, Tim Hubberstey, Farrokh Khodadadi,
              Jed Margolin, Pat McCarthy, Glenn McNamara, Rich Moore,
              John Ray, Doug Snyder, Alex Taccir.

         NEW EMPLOYEES:

         Tom Clark is the new Component Engineer in Rick Meyette's
         group. Welcome aboard, Tom!!

         Farrokh Khodadadi is a "new" technician in Chris Downend's
         team. He most recently worked in Atari's Field Service.
         Welcome aboard, Farrokh!!


         ANALOG PC DESIGN:

         What will increase our success at designing analog PCBs that
         work? Doug and Pat feel that the hardware engineer should do
         the placement on Scicards. The knowledge required to interact
         with the system can be obtained fairly quickly with the help
         of the PC designers.  Jed feels that a PC-based layout
         program would be a worthwhile investment.


         JAMMA EDGE CONNECTOR CURRENT CAPACITY:

         John Ray announced that the standard we will use (for the
         near term) is 3 Amps per terminal + 1 redundant terminal. So
         both +12V and both -5V terminals need to be used to bring
         power to the board. For a game that requires 5A at +5V, you
         should use three of the four +5V terminals for power. John
         will publish a memo in the near future that will be more
         specific and incorporate some exceptions that Rick Meyette
         suggested. Pat McCarthy will request data from the
         manufacturers that will help us decide on the long-term
         standard.


         EPROM PROGRAMMERS:

         John Ray announced that the version 4.0 Data I/O 288 release
         (expected late July) will incorporate TI's SNAP programming
         algorithm. This algorithm will allow us to program TI parts
         significantly faster. We will need to use only TI EPROMs,
         however, but this is not expected to be a big problem. Chris
         Downend is investigating other EPROM programmers. The
         hardware engineers should keep abreast of flash EEPROMs, as
         they will someday allow each development station to burn
         their EEPROMs right in the PCB!!

         ELECTRO-STATIC DISCHARGE (ESD):

         Our games are subjected to shocks from players who have
         walked across a carpet and then touch a metal part of the
         game. The game must not do anything weird when this happens.
         Pat McCarthy reminded us that Rick Meyette's group needs to
         perform an ESD test on every new game, just like the FCC test
         (and the heat test??). Pat and Rick should look at
         structuring the procedures so that they do not get left out
         on any new games.

         The Hitron power supply was shutting down when subjected to
         ESD. Rick Meyette has a fix to keep it from doing this.


         RF COMPONENTS ON ALL PCBs:

         Rick Meyette should look at a plot of all new PCBs for EMI
         component placement (before the PCB is fabbed). The hardware
         engineer should make sure this happens.

         32K X 8 85nS:

         The hardware engineers responded that this speed will work in
         any current applications where this part is being used.


         DOUG LEAVING:

         Doug Snyder has decided to leave Atari effective July 7. Doug
         has been an extremely creative, productive, valuable
         employee.  We will miss him!!

         Doug -- Best of luck for your future!!  Thanks for a job well
         done!!


         Please forward any additions, corrections, or questions to
         John Ray.

Hello:

    Dave Akers and myself are about to embark on our next project 
together and would like some help from the many talented, innovative
and handsome people hear at Atari. 

    We have informally run a number of possible game types past
some of the grande fromages here at this company and have decided
to explore the genre of the low cost puzzle type game. Pong, Tetris 
and Arkinoid being prime examples of these types of games that have 
been successful in the past. Hopefully this NEW game will be added 
to that list in the future.

    So we are going to have a little "PO-like" get-together to try
and compile as many ideas as possible and y'all are invited.

    			Friday afternoon the 14th of July @ 3:30
    					Central Conference Room 
    						  675 Sycamore.

    A variety of beverages, snacks and various materials will be 
available for your personal consumption and enjoyment.    		

    	  Remember: Think cheap, think simple, think addictive.

    				   Formal attire optional.
    				
Thanx,

MSP

PS If you are not talented, innovative or handsome we will have a 
   short meeting before the 3:30 meeting to determine any new 
   catagories that need to be established to fit your circumstance.

STUN Runner has been pulled from Milpitas Golfland after giving us good feedback
on gameplay changes.  We were #2 for two weeks (behind Hard Drivin') on 25 
cent play!

We are continuing to tweak the game play as per input from field test.

Max Behensky has finished working on improving the vector mode of the GSP and 
has also improved overall performance for us.  Stephanie Mott has
made changes to the ADSP code to help us improve control response time and we
are curretnly implemneting the changes neede to take advantage of her efforts.

We are anticipating new audio including a new music track as well as some
additional voice and sound effects.

We have received the Field Test cabinet and set it up for test.  The game 
is currently in the Engineering Common area.

In our continuing efforts to provide the best benefits, a supplemental
Universal Life Insurance program is once again available.  This program, called
Benefits 360, is underwritten by Aetna Life Insurance and Annuity Company.

We selected Benefits 360 because we think it offers our employees a good way to
improve their financial security.  Many financial experts say the type of
universal life insurance offered in this plan is a smart choice because it
features:
  Death Benefit protection when you need it, even if you move or retire.

  Cash Value that earns a competitive interest rate, with all interest earned
  tax-free until withdrawal.

This excellent insurance is available to you with the advantages of "mass
purchasing power".  These include favorable underwriting, easy enrollment, and
favorable rates.

If you have been a full time or part time employee for the last 12 months and
are over 21 years of age, you are eligible to participate in the Benefits 360
program.  Participation in the program is voluntary, but I hope you will
seriously consider what the plan can mean to you and those who depend on you.

Keep these three points in mind:

  You will own your own policy and can purchase policies for your spouse,
  dependent children and grandchildren even if you don't have a policy
  yourself.

  Plan premiums are flexible enough to fit most budgets an you pay premiums
  through payroll deduction.

  If you should ever leave Atari Games employment, you policy goes with you
  without a premium change.

To help you learn all you want to know about Benefits 360, you will have the
chance to meet individually with an Aetna benefits counselor.  Individual
meetings are planned to start the week of July 10, 1989.

Thank you,
Yvette

P.S.  If you are not interested in this plan, you have to sign a waver.  Please
contact Yvette at x5850.

Stun Runner
-----------
Last week I gave Art the inputs for Stun MultiSync, which requires marking the
schematics to show what is loaded on the board and doing the parts list.
It does not involve any PC layout changes.

We have been bumped from the schedule by a job they are doing for Tengen. I
have not been given a reschedule date.


ADSP II
-------
The parts list for the Stun Runner version of ADSP II is ready to be signed off.
This assumes you want all six graphics ROMs stuffed.

NO!  This isn't a story about the ATARI Survivors
(how are they doin' anyway?).  This is about YOUR
chance (THE PITCHERS) to present your game ideas
to project teams (THE PITCHEES) in what we call
a "PITCH SESSION".

Remember those great ideas you had at the last
brainstorming?  Did you feel that your group had
a great idea only to be destined to the dusty
shelves of antiquity?  If so (or even if you have
a new idea) here's your chance to let others hear
about it!  (AND, just for doing the pitch, your
team will receive an incentive of $100.!)

CAN YOU AFFORD TO PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY?????

Of course not!  Get your buddies together and stop
by LOIS TURNER's office for your free Pitch Session
Packet.  It will outline what a Pitch Session is
and show you how to present your idea.

           DO IT TODAY!!!!

Subj:	Just when you thought it was safe to pick up the phone...


	Hey, Tengen affictionados:

	We can't dial Tengen directly as though they were extensions,
cuz the hardware didn't work reliably enough, and it cost an arm and a
leg.  However, there is a system speed dial to help you along.

	At an INSIDE dial tone, you can dial pound-6, and the last 4
digits of a Tengen extension (which you can get off the phone list).
The first two digits of this will be 94.  So, if you wanted to call
their operator, you would dial pound, 6, 9, 4, 0, 0 (their operator's
phone number is 473-9400).  DO NOT DIAL 9 first, or you'll get wierd
(but inexpensive) (and also useless) results.

	For those of you with ETS sets, you can replace the pound-6
part with SYS SPD.  So you dial SYS SPD, 9, 4, 0, 0 to get the operator.

	Of course, for those whose tired fingers can't learn new tricks,
the old way (9, 473-94xx) will still work.  As will the old corporate
phone number (ends in 2650), which we are trying to phase out.

	The phone list is again being updated.  Be patient; James has
quite a few things to do before he can give you a nicely printed copy.
Watch for them at your local mail station, and let your fingers do
the talking!

	So you all know about the jackets, and you're probably trying
to zero in on the color of your choice to match your set of wheels.
But you also wann'a know how much $ it's gonna set you back, right?
Well that depends on the total number of orders that Elaine gets from
everyone, but the most it can cost is about $40 maybe less. By the way
we've moved the dead line to next Friday July 21st. I know I said Friday
the 13th before, I was looking at July of 1990. Don't forget to tell
Elaine if you want to have your name on the front of your jacket, it
is a service that the vender is offering us at no extra charge.
	If you still have not seen it, go check it out at customer
service. They have one in white but you can get it in black or red, I
think one of each will be perfect ! decisions decisions ...

Subj:	Stockroom/Incoming Receiving/Incoming Inspection Reorganization.


   Sorry about the short notice but things seem to happen faster than we can
communicate them. If you have been in the manufacturing area in building 735
anytime this week you would have seen some contractors working on lighting and
new fencing which will illuminate and secure the manufacturing inventory.

   We had a very small window, in between Escape, Skull & Xbones, and Cyberball
to accomplish this reorganization. We are currently planning to follow this
simplified schedule:
   1. Incoming Receiving - Shutdown Thursday July 20th at 12:30pm and re-open
      Tuesday morning July 25th. Possibly earlier !
   2. Stockroom - Shutdown Thursday July 20th at 2:00pm and re-open Tuesday
      morning July 25th.
During this shutdown period we will restructure the stockroom strictly in part
number sequence with locator addresses for the material that must be stored in
bulk locations. Additionally we will do a complete physical inventory to insure
an accurate on hand quantity.

   This is an extremely aggressive schedule and will require the complete focus
of the entire materials organization. It would be of great help if any material
requirement that you have during this four day period could be requested by
12:00pm on Thursday July 20th. We would do our very best to fill those orders
by 2:30pm the same day. Also if you are expecting the receipt of a Purchase
Order that MUST be received, please let me know, we'll make sure it is received
and that you are notified.

   Thanx very much for your understanding and patience. We will be looking
forward to showing you our NEW Stockroom in the very near future when we have
our OPEN HOUSE.

Sorry about the short notice but things happen faster than we can 
communicate them. If you haven't noticed our AutoCad stations and Plot
paper files are really a mess lately with the rush to release Ride-On
Stun Runner.

We have an extremely small porthole to work with in between Escape Graphics,
Skull & Crossbones and Cyberball Kits to accomplish this reorganization.

This will be an astronomically aggressive schedule and will require the
most intensly focused effort of the entire I.D. and Product Design group.

Tanks very much for all the support, in advance, since we will have to shut
down the department for 67.89 minutes. we will be looking forward to showing
you our drawers in the ever so close future when we have an open house.

Sorry about the short notice but things happen faster than We can communicate

has way too many digits in them.

I have an outragously miniscule pinhole to work with what with the release
of Stun Runner coming and all to accomplish this task.

This will be an unbelievably aggressive schedule and will require the shutdown
of the department for 17.27 weeks.

thank you all for your understanding. The new system will begin with drawing

I will have an open house when I'm good and ready!!!!

We have two games out on Filed Test now, both in the Ride-On cabinet.  One game
at Emerald Hills is set of 50 cent play / 50 cent continue.  The other game at
Sunnyvale Golfland is set on 50 cent player / 25 cent continue.  Both games 
appear to be doing very well.

Pete Takaichi has generated an updated Release Schedule for STUN Runner.  
For those needing specific information from this new chedule, see Pete for 
a copy.  Specifically, however, the schedule addresses not only production 
and pre-prod issues, but the building of the 6 games for the AMOA show in 
September as well.  Everything looks to be on shedule for both the show 
dates and the scheduled FGA.

Rick Meyette ran a preliminary FCC test and temperature test on the 
Sunnyvale Test unit before it went out to test.  Changes to placement of 
the PCBs and power supply are being planned as a result of that test.  We 
will be delivering another game to Rick by the 27th of July for further 
testing.  This one will be as close to a production version as possible.  
As for the temperature results, the attract header has been vented to bring 
the temperature of that section of the cabinet into acceptable range.

Software developement continues. I will generate a complete list of 
remaining software action items by the end of the week.  New scenarios have 
been programmed for the Chopper and the Ornobot enemies and a new attract 
demo sequence is nearly complete.

Screen graphics are in pretty good shape.  We will need some "end-game" 
animations done, but aside from that, some "text screen beautification" and 
fixing minor tunnel problems, everything is looking good.

We have received new audio for the game.  This includes new opening music, 
as well as an improved shockwave sound and a number of new voice cues.  In 
addition, the SAII audio board has been modified to address the amplitude 
problems relative to the AD-PCM section versus the Yamaha section of the audio.
Jed Margolin has given us what appears to the final version of the 
stand-alone self-test ROMS.

Subj:	Stun Runner Self-Test


The following things remain to be done in order for Stun Runner Self-Test to
be complete:

	1. Turn on checksums for the program ROMs that will be used;

	2. Use final Sound ID number for the test sound;

	3. Integrate the ROM with the Stun Runner program. (Self-Test uses 
	   about half of the ROM 0 pair.)


I have specified Slapstic 17. According to MANMAN we have 2,745 Slapstic 17s
in inventory and the part was assigned only to the Driver, which did not use
it.

If it is changed for any reason it will be necessary to change Self-Test which
works through Slapstic to get ROM 7 checksums.

Don Paauw is on vacation this week and therefore unavailable for comment if
we are to release the Hardware this week.

I have a list of the pulls and keys for Slapstic 17 if you want it.

The PCB assemblies for the MultiSync board and the ADSP II board have been 
released.  We have also given a parts list to manufacturing listing the parts
and quantities required by engineering to build the 6 AMOA show games.

The SA II audio PCB has been finished, and the parts list has been sent to 
manufacturing.  The final release should happen by 8/4.

Software developement continues. I have generate a completed list of 
remaining software action items.  The new attract demo sequence is complete.
The "Final challenge" has been added and debugged, and the track design and
traffic for the final challenge level is nearly complete.  We will now 
begin to add the intermediate challenge levels.

Screen graphics are in pretty good shape.  We will still need some "end-game" 
animations done, but Will is on vacation, and he should be able to get to 
that when he returns.

ROMs for SA II					
--------------
	The schematics for the SA II call for 300 ns 27512s. If that is what 
you really want, then that is what I will specify.

	However, you should know that a 27512 is an NMOS part and we do not
stock them and they may be difficult to get. (CMOS has generally taken over.) 

	Note also that we do not stock 300 ns EPROMs or OTPs. 

	Tell me which part you want to use.

Ed Rotberg is at Siggraph this week.

Software development continues on the design of various intermediate
challenge levels.  The "Ultimate Challenge", and "Bonus Marker Challenge"
levels have been designed.  Though the "Bonus Marker Challenge" is not
fully implemented at this time.  By 8/14, all challenge levels should be
designed and implemented.

Screen graphics have been cleaned up and are in pretty good shape.  Will
Noble is currently looking into the "end-game" animations, but will not
be able to work on them until he has completed "ThunderJaws" focus graphics.

The PCB assemblies for the MultiSync board and the ADSP II board have been 
released.  We have also given a parts list to manufacturing listing the parts
and quantities required by engineering to build the 6 AMOA show games.

The STUN RUNNER action list is slowly dwindling. Even with the FGA move up,
it looks like we should have no trouble meeting our schedule.

Thanks,

The STUN RUNNER TEAM

         Inter-Office Memo                     Atari Games Corporation

         To: Sandi Brown

         From: John Ray

         Subject: 401K Money Market Fund                  Date: 8/3/89
         _____________________________________________________________

         As we discussed last week, there are several people who would
         like to see the Money Market Fund available as one of the
         options for the 401K plans. The main reason is that none of
         the other plans invest in securities "backed by the full
         faith and security of the U.S. government". Several people
         have indicated that they want to have some portion of their
         savings to be very secure, regardless of any financial crisis
         that may occur.

         As you suggested, I sent out a VAX message to the people who
         report to Chris, Rick Moncrief, and me asking who would like
         to invest in the Money Market Fund. The following people
         indicated that they would like to invest in it:

              John Ray                 Bob Flanagan
              Glenn McNamara           Rick Moncrief
              Norm Avellar             Max Behensky

         Inter-Office Memo                     Atari Games Corporation

         To: Sandi Brown

         From: John Ray

         Subject: 401K Money Market Fund                  Date: 8/3/89
         _____________________________________________________________

         As we discussed last week, there are several people who would
         like to see the Money Market Fund available as one of the
         options for the 401K plans. The main reason is that none of
         the other plans invest in securities "backed by the full
         faith and security of the U.S. government". Several people
         have indicated that they want to have some portion of their
         savings to be very secure, regardless of any financial crisis
         that may occur.

         As you suggested, I sent out a VAX message to the people who
         report to Chris, Rick Moncrief, and me asking who would like
         to invest in the Money Market Fund. The following people
         indicated that they would like to invest in it:

              John Ray                 Bob Flanagan
              Glenn McNamara           Rick Moncrief
              Norm Avellar             Max Behensky
              Mark Pierce              Jed Margolin
              Ed Rotberg               Erik Durfey

         I would appreciate it very much if you could approach Dennis
         Wood about adding the Money Market Fund to our list of
         options. Please let me know if I can do anything else to help

FGA has been moved forward by one week, as everything is proceeding smoothly.

An ECN was issued for the formed seat part so that the drawing corresponded 
better with the tolerances acutally used for the part.

Cabinet graphics have been released.

The game graphics are in pretty good shape.  Except for the ending 
sequence and some background for the "points" attract screen we are in 
pretty good shape.

The audio is also in pretty good shape except for the male voice and the 
Boost sound.  We are experimenting with a Yamaha sound for the boost right 
now in order to avoid priority problems.  I don't know what is going to 
happen with the male audio voice.

Program development continues.  We have added the Ultimate challenge as 
well as the Marker challenge level and all the hooks to add the Kill challenge 
level.  The Kill challenge level should be in by the end of the day.  We 
are trying to get a new version ready for field test that includes the new 
Challenge levels in order to firm up the "legs" of the game.  Other tuning 
and tweaking continues also.

Subj:	Sho Graphics Press Release

The following press release was placed in several computer 
graphics publications prior to the SIGGRAPH '89 Conference.

        NEW 3-D GRAPHICS ENGINE FROM ATARI GAMES

           TO BE ON DISPLAY AT SIGGRAPH SHOW

MILPITAS, Calif., July 5, 1989 --  A new high-performance 3-D       
graphics engine, promising advanced capabilities at a fraction
of the cost of similar products, will be on display at the 
upcoming SIGGRAPH '89 Conference, July 31 - August 4 in Boston.

     The new graphics engine, dubbed ShoView, is under
development by Sho Graphics, a division of Milpitas, Calif.-
based Atari Games Corporation.  According to Rich Moore,
Vice President/Engineering, ShoView will compete with a
growing category of solid modeling engines designed for
CAD/CAM, architectural, simulation, video animation and
other sophisticated 3-D applications.  ShoView will operate
with an IBM PC and other IBM-compatible systems, Moore said.

     ShoView's impressive solid modeling performance allows
a wide variety of users to create more complex and highly
realistic 3-D scenes and images.  The power of the ShoView
architecture allows 1 million 3-D matrix transformations
per second, breaking major price/performance barriers.
In excess of 190,000 clipped and projected polygons per
second can be processed.

     In contrast to other systems, Gourand shading and
texture mapping are fully supported by the unique 
ShoView architecture without loss of frame fill rate.
Application programs can use a high-level 3-D graphics
library, allowing greatly enhanced levels of 
interactivity when dealing with complex 3-D objects
and scenes.

    ShoView will interface with any standard multi-
sync monitor having VGA line resolution, and displays
over 65,000 simultaneous colors from a palette of 16         
million.  Lighting is automatically calculated using
up to four independent white light sources.  Also,
each pixel has a 16-bit z buffer, and the system
features a double-buffered display screen and fast
screen clear.

Sho Graphics expects to ship small quantities of
ShoView systems to the field by fourth quarter 1989,
with full scale production and shipping beginning 
in first quarter 1990.  Specific marketing and
distribution plans have not been finalized, Moore
reported.  

     "Our overall plan is to bring a product to
market that will offer far greater processing
power and more advanced features for less than 
half the cost of other advanced graphics products
now entering the market," he said.

     Moore reported that Sho Graphics's primary
goals at SIGGRAPH will be to demonstrate ShoView
to industry insiders, as well as to continue the
process of encouraging software developers to
write new ShoView applications for other computer
systems and workstations via the HOOPS library.

     "Our basic message at SIGGRAPH will be that
we have developed a highly cost-effective hardware
solution which allows a broad range of applications
to tap the power of interactive 3-D graphics,"
Moore said.  "We believe this product offers an
extraordinarily high level of performance that 
will bring quality 3-D graphic capability to users
previously priced out of interactive 3-D graphics,
or those who were dissatisfied with existing systems."

     This year's SIGGRAPH conference is expected to
draw up to 30,000 visitors to Boston's Hynes 
Convention Center.  Sho Graphics will demonstrate 
ShoView in booth #2355.  In addition, the firm will
offer a hospitality suite, allowing software
developers and other interested conference-goers
a chance to meet with the ShoView development team
and company officials.

     Sho Graphics is a new division of Atari Games
Corporation, one of the world's leading video game
software and hardware developers, and is headquartered
at 675 Sycamore Drive, Milpitas, Calif., 95035-1110;
(408) 434-3700.  Atari Games Corporation is a
privately held company, is not affiliated with Atari
Corporation, and should be referred to as Atari Games.

We will eventually load up vms 5 (probably 5.2), but I can't say exactly
when we will be doing this. To be sure, EVERYTHING will break when we
do, and due to the nature of the beast, all the systems have to be set
to vms 5 at the same time. We don't relish the problems this is going
to cause and are certainaly in no hurry to get to them. The saying
goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".

Subj:	The difference between pay PHONES and PAY phones


	I just got a flyer from Pacific Bell with regards to a new rate
proposal.  The folder is very informative.  It confirms much of what was
speculated and surmised, and the new rates attempt to address some major
discrepancies.  The way things are now:

	Depending on whose pay phone it is, local calls can cost any amount
they want to charge.  Of particular significance is that some calls may be
rejected.  Also, calls from a pay phone may be cut off in the middle (or
even in the beginning) if you are calling from a non-reputable (read non-
Bell-Operating-company) pay phone.

	You may or may not be able to get to 800 numbers, 911, and even 0
may not work.  Often you can't select long distance carriers.  You probably
won't be able to dial 411, or 555 numbers in any area code.  The reason is
that they can't charge you for those calls; they don't make money, you can't
talk.

	Many pay phones are unmarked or misleadingly marked with regards to
operating company and long distance carrier.  As Mike has pointed out, many
unethical companies go to great lengths to allow you to decieve yourself
(they won't explicitly identify themselves as AT&T or Pacific Bell or any
Bell operating company, but they will suggest it and allow you to believe it).

	There is a 40 cent surcharge per call for using calling cards from
a pay phone.  The way I read it, it is irrelevant whose card it is (Pac Bell,
AT&T, MCI, Sprint, or Fly-By-Night Enterprises).  There is also a $1 surcharge
for collect calls, so don't expect to save money that way.

	They are proposing to fix many of these wrongs.  The surcharges will
remain, however.  In addition, they are proposing a 30 cent surcharge for
operator assistance (any number starting with 0), which will be charged in
addition to the 40 cents or dollar charge for the call itself.

	The Bell operating companies (Pacific Bell, Nevada Bell, etc) are
known to be reputable.  You're not going to get screwed by these guys.  The
major long distance carriers (AT&T, MCI, Sprint, and there may or may not
be others, but I know about these guys) are also in it for the long haul, and
don't want to lose your business at home or work because of a single call.
But the other guys (FBNE, etc) are out for the quick bucks, and specialise
in pay phones and hotels.  Some hotels are rejecting the low bidders on phone
services because the guests get so inflamed.  This is currently news...most
allow the customer to pick up the tab, and the heat.  If you travel, check
at the desk BEFORE you pick up the phone.  Some hotels even charge you to
call the front desk.  And check your bill; if you call somewhere on a calling
card, sometimes the computer will charge you anyways, and at hotel rates.

	The point of all this is:  The situation is very bad.  It's easy to get
taken, and for an awful lot of money.  Don't use hotel phones unless you know
in advance what carrier they use (you probably won't be able to select) and
you know about the hotels phone rates, and you STILL want to make the call.
On a pay phone, ALWAYS select your carrier.  Don't make local calls on calling
cards.  And last but most important, if a pay phone or hotel phone is deemed
unacceptable, COMPLAIN.  Go down to the desk and ask the manager where you
can make a call without getting reamed, just to let him know that he is losing
business.  Ask him "what other hotels use this phone system so I can better
plan my next trip."  If you can't dial information or the operator, mark the
phone out of order.  If you can't select your carrier at a pay phone (ALWAYS
select your carrier, even for what you think are local calls), complain to
the owner of the business that his phone service is inadequate, and ask to
use his phone.  When he says he won't, ask where to find another 7-11 or 
gas station or (whatever business it is) that has a pay phone that works.
ALWAYS mark the phone out of order (and why) when you discover something you
should be able to do but can't (like no 800 calls).  Maybe these guys will
wise up and clean up their act, or wise up and close up.  And you'll save
yourself a fortune, even if it is only calling for pizza to the hotel room.
A local call from a hotel can run past $10.

	Selecting a carrier:  There is a number (10288 or 1-0-ATT for ATT,
10222 for MCI, and another (102xx) for any other carrier.  You insert this
before the call.  Your normal long distance carrier is trying real hard
for you to memorize their number.  You should.  I don't remember the one
for Sprint, but if Sprint is what you use, look on your bill, and I'm sure
you'll find it.  Only depend on what you know to be the case (your home
carrier and the carrier at work (which is MCI, by the way)).

	The soapbox is now available for the next speaker.

Game graphics are in very good shape.  We are primarily waiting on the 
end-game sequence stuff. including fireworks and the kissy-kissy animation.

Audio is also in pretty good shape.  We need to do some fine tuning of 
amplitude levels, and decide whether or not to keep the male voice or add 
some more female voice.

Program development continues.  We have added the Kill Challenge as 
and the Boost Challenge level, and all attendant high score tables.  All 
that remains for actual "game play" is final tuning.  We have also added 
the automatic reset of high score table mode as an operator selectable 
option.  Work is also in progress on coding the end-game sequence.  Jed has 
given the final Self-Test code, and we are doing a trial run of adding all 
of the various and sundry checksums needed to the multi-sync and ADSP rom sets.
Jed and Ed are currently working on putting together the operator's manual 
for the game.

Subj:	New tools...


Be on the alert. I released a new version of LLF (v3.0) which fixed a number
of problems and has a completely redesigned internal expression evaluator.
The new expression evaluator was to accomodate the requirements of the MACAS
and MAC68K assemblers.

I also released new versions of MAC65, MACAS, MAC68K and MACPP which have
some minor bug fixes and one major change which you might want to use.
Namely, the .ENABLE/.DSABLE LOWER_CASE option. Using this option will
enable/disable case sensitivity on label, symbol, macro keyword and dummy
argument names. This is the only way to get lowercase labels/symbols
into the object file. Also, using .ENABLE LOWER will cause the assemblers
to pass the psect name unchanged to the object file (i.e. it won't add the
trailing "_" to the name). The defaults are .DSABLE LOWER for MAC65 and
MACPP and .ENABL LOWER for MACAS and MAC68K. (Note that .ENABL LC does
nothing, it is just for compatability with older MAC65 programs).

I also added the "0x" prefix to numbers to indicate hexidecimal radix.
I.e. a hex number can be expressed globally with .radix 16, or locally
with ^X, ^H, 0x or 0X prefixed. The ^X or ^H options allow for temporary
radix change in an expression, where the 0x is only recognised on an
individual number:

	^X<some_expression>+0x123456 - 0xFFFF

The following is an exceprt from the changes files for LLF and MACxx
in case you're interested:

/**********************************************************************
 *
 * LLF edit history
 *
 * 890823_DMS - v3.0 (not released before this date). Fixed a bug in
 *		the expression evaluator which inadvertanly zapped one
 *		of the terms of a compound expression. Modules affected:
 *		symdef and pass2.
 *
 * 890722_DMS - v3.0 no different from 2.9 but because of the substantial
 *		changes in 2.8 and 2.9 (neither were released), this
 *		version change indicates that the differences were major.
 *
 * 890720_DMS - v2.9 Changed the way segment names are handled. They now
 *		are stored internally with a trailing space so they won't
 *		match a like named global symbol (the space is removed
 *		when the name is put in the output file). I also changed
 *		the expression output such that if the expression resolves
 *		to a constant, it is converted to a text string (.LB output
 *		only). This makes the .LB output file quite a bit smaller.
 *		Fixed a bug in .start handling. Modules affected: outx,
 *		pass1, pass2, object. This version never released.
 *
 * 890104_DMS - v2.8 .TEST couldn't have worked with the way the expressions
 *		were handled (seperate stacks). So expression handling was

Game graphics are in excellent shape.  We pretty much have all we need with 
the possible exception of some final tweaking or re-working a few items (I 
would like to get all the seams out of the tunnels & fix the simple station 
pieces.)

Audio is also in pretty good shape.  We still need to decide whether or not
to keep the male voice or add some more female voice.  We also need the 
victory music added for the final sequence, and a few more explosions would 
be nice.

Program development continues.  We have changed the continue mode to 
proceed to the next game level instead of making the player play through 
each level until he completes it.  This has solved a number of other 
related small problems.  We have tweaked the attracted mode some more.  
Andy has almost finished the end-game animation sequence.  When that is 
complete, we plan to spend the rest of our time fine-tuning the traffic 
layout in each level.

Subj:	Tilting pixblits


Since this display is bit-mapped, could we get rotating pixblits by
just specifying a delta scanline and delta pixel address for some
rectangular pixblit picture as it is being output to the display?
That is, start at the lower left of a pixblit buffer and for every
x-pos you advance in the source, advance an x-pos and decrement the
scanline in the destination to get a 45 degree angle.

There could be a table of integer rations of delta rise over delta
run for roughly 5 degree intervals of rotation.  Then the program 
would select the nearest one.  Would it still be too slow to be
feasible? I figured it would be less distracting to have some 
scrolling which is less than smooth compared to the jarring effect 
of the scenery blinking out when the player's point of view is rolled.

Subj:	RADMOD,VPIF,TEK update

8/22/89
RADMOD, VPIF, and TEK update:

-------------------------------------------------------
If you would prefer not to be bothered by future RADMOD, VPIF, or TEK updates,
stop reading and reply as such via VAXMAIL.
-------------------------------------------------------
If you don't know what I'm talking about,
   "run [theurer.pps]radmod" will allow you to do almost anything imaginable
	to graphics files in the areas of file format conversion, palette
	management, image manipulation(scaling,rotation...), and usage 
	reporting (palette & pixel usage, display on VT101, ...) .
   "run [theurer.ws]vpif" will allow you (with just a flick of your finger)
	to view graphics files on the VAX on one of our 2 GPX 19" color
	monitors (back in the Holy Grail 3d terminal room).  This is great for
	weeding out trash files or checking things before burning EPROMS.
   "run [theurer.cop.tek]tek" will give you a color printout of a graphics
	file in almost any format.

RADMOD, VPIF, and TEK all use the same file format decoding code, so if one
can do it, they all can.

RADMOD has undergone major internal reconstructive surgery (to make it easier
to modify and to fix some bugs), and a few new features have been added.  
Please report any bugs to me ASAP.  
If you run into a problem with the new version and need to temporarily run
the old one, it has been moved to RADMOD_SAFE.

New features:
--> Diffusion dithering is available when reducing the number of colors.  This
    can sometimes produce amazing results with only 16 colors.
--> Reads PICS type animation files. This means you can use Macromind's
    Director and EA's Studio/1 to create animation and then easily convert it
    to RAD format.
--> Outputs to TEXTURE file format (for Holy Grail 3D hardware).
--> Inputs and outputs ASCII format (the low byte of pixel).  With this you
    can get a printout of the picture's actual pixel values.  Or you can edit
    the picture from your VT101 keyboard.  Warning on this: it only looks at
    the low 4 bits of a pixel, and it only transfers the 1st palette.
--> Reads IFF/ILBM HAM files (4096 colors) from the Amiga.
--> Reads old fashioned PICT1 files from the Mac.
--> Attempts to handle merging of several input files with different palettes
    into one output palette.  If it detects that you're trying to do this, it
    will present you with a list of 6 options.  This works great for combining
    multiple RAD files into one.
--> Reads and writes BOB file format (in honor of Bob Flanagan).  This is your
    most basic format, where all you've got is the picture size, it's
    palette, and the uncompressed pixels.  This is the format to use if you have
    a program that generates pictures that you want to get into RAD format.

Minor changes:
--> If you're converting a bunch of RAD cels to a format which only holds one
    cel per file (such as NEO), it will now tack the cel # onto the end of the
    filename for all files after the first.  This makes it easier to figure
    out what's in those files. In the past it created new file names by 
    tacking a 1,2,3.... onto the end of the filename.
--> When you ask for a list of cells (the L answer to "choose cells?") it
    will now indicate which cells you've already done and which ones you're 
    going to do.  You can back out a selection by entering it with a - sign
    in front of it.  And you can now exit without doing anything.
--> DPIC (display picture on screen) now gives you the option of looking at
    the low 4 bits (the pixel value) or the high 4 bits (the palette number)
    for each pixel on your VT101 monitor..

Bug fixes:
--> Occasional crashes due to memory allocation problems.
--> DMUL (display multiple palette usage within stamps) used to give erroneous
    results if palettes higher than 3 were used.

So there.

The OTPs are for the SA II board which was done by the Sound Group. They
doe not care what the part numbers (or checksums) are. 

At the time I was under the impression that these would be the only OTPs so
I thought a separate series would not be necessary.

Since then I have found out that there will be a confusing mix of EPROMs and 
OTPs. 

We will ECN the existing OTPs to the OTP Series.

I believe I've finally got the damn TEK que working again. I couldn't get it to
work with the custom hardware on Bert, so I hooked it up to one of the 386/PC's
we have running Unix (which doesn't require any custom hardware). Then I hacked
to bits the TEK symboint code forcing it to open a network connection to the
Unix system via TCP/IP and blasting your file to a daemon which is always
listening on the Unix system. After the file is sent to the printer the Unix
node sends a message back to Bert which in turn will send a message to your
terminal that the job has completed. As before, the job completed message only
means the file has been sent to the printer, it'll still take a few minutes for
it to actually print your file. 

Let me know if you have any trouble especially if your print doesn't
come out, but the system said it "completed".

Subj:	RADMOD update: merging files with different palettes


8/29/89

RADMOD update: palette conflicts when merging files with different palettes

If you are trying to fit picture "A" with an alien palette into 
RAD file "B", and you want to remap picture "A" to a subset of the RAD's
palettes, then use the new S option.  Simply answer S when it asks you
what to do about the palette conflict problem.  Then enter the range
of subpalettes to use for your new picture.  A subpalette is any group of
16 colors, starting at color #0,16,32,48, etc.  The range must be contiguous.
So if you wanted to remap to subpalettes 3 and 4 (colors 48 thru 79) then
you'd enter "3-4".  Picture "A" will be inserted into the RAD file "B" and
all the pixels in picture "A" will be remapped to use pixel values 48 thru 79,
according to the closest color match.

Other options:
CR (default): Subpalette groupings are maintained.  First I try to remap to
   identical colors, then I use up black (unused colors), then I go for closest
   colors.
P: this will remap all pixels to the original palette "A".  It will also
   maintain subpalette groupings, so each group of 16 colors will remain 
   together.
B: this will remap all pixels to the original palette "A". It ignores subpalette
   groupings.
K: this will discard the new palette "B" and leave all pixel values as is.
R: this will replace original palette "A" with the new palette "B" and leave
   all pixel values as is.
1-15: Whatever # you enter is the palette # to be added to every pixel in 
   picture "B".  The palette from picture "B" is then moved to palette "A",
   starting at the palette # which you entered.

If you're totally confused by all this, then I've succeeded in my mission.
Stop by my office and I'll explain in more detail.

Subj:	LLF and .org incompatible


	It has come to my attention that using llf to "compress"
your .ol files to .lb files is a bad idea for files containing
".org"s to absolute addresses. Dave says he'll fix it eventually,
but meanwhile, _don't_ do it to xxx_root.ol (whatever program you
have that includes gen_root.asm). Since this is (usually) the
only file with absolute ".org"s (for the vectors), just using the
.ol file should be a suitable work-around.

	If you are confused, call or e-mail me. If you have _no_idea_
what I'm talking about, it probably doesn't matter.

Audio is also in pretty good shape.  We decided not to keep the male voice
but added some more female voice.  We also received the victory music for the
final sequence, and another explosion.

Program development continues.  We have added a T-shirt contest mode, and

Cabinet Graphics were reviewed and approved with a few minor modifications.

The manual continues along painfully.

Subj:	File renaming


I wrote a procedure (not exhaustively tested) which you can use to rename
files with wider output wildcard rules than those allowed by VMS's RENAME.
This procedure comes in handy when you want to insert or remove some chars
in the middle of a bunch of filenames for example. To run it:

$ @UTL$COM:WILD_RENAME [input_file_spec [output_file_spec]]

It will prompt you for missing item(s). You must have a wildcard
(either a "*" or "%") in both the input and output filespecs. It
only pays attention to the first wildcard found in either of the
filespecs for the purposes of creating a new filename. It does,
however, pay attention to all the wildcards in the input filename
for purposes of finding the file. For example:

$ WREN :== @UTL$COM:WILD_RENAME	!shortcut
$ wren abcde* abc*	!The "de" will effectively be removed
			!from all files whose names begin with
			!abcde in the current dir.
$ wren abcde%% abc*	!The "de" will be removed from all files
			!named abcdexx where xx is any 2 chars but exactly
			!2 chars.
$ wren abc*de* xyz*	!files whose name begins with abc and there's
			!a "de" somewhere after that will have the
			!"abc" replaced with an "xyz"
$ wren abc*de tvw*xyz	!sorry, it'll ignore the xyz of the output filespec
			!so it'll just change the "abc" files to "tvw" files.
$ wren old.a* new.b*	!wild card rules work for filetypes too.
$ wren abc*.def* xyz*.tvw*	!or both names and types

Note: if either the input filename or input filetype is unspecified, it
defaults to "*".

Oops. The WILD_RENAME program had a small problem which made it rename
rather wildly. I fixed it and added a third parameter which, if non-blank,
will make it just display what it would rename without actually
doing it. This lets you do a dry run to verify that it'll rename only
what you want it to.

The advantage for two pots is:

	The documentation currently calls out two.
	
The disadvantage for two pots is:

	Operators can get confused.

I recommend that:

	Byron and Ed verify that a short instead of the PCB pot 
        sounds ok (you can't hear the clipping).

	Byron generate the ECN to insert a jumper instead of 
        the PCB pot. (Work with Art to find the best way of 
        doing this just for STUN, and not on future versions, 
        if any.)

	Ed and Carole make sure the manual says the right thing 
        (one pot instead of two).

Let me know ASAP if you disagree.

Thanks!!

the makefiles I've seen give it some other name, but I'd like to
steal "gcc" to be the means of invoking the Gnu C Compiler for
the ASAP and 68K (and Vax, and maybe Lint). Anyway, if it's a
_BIG_ deal, i'll skip it, but please let me know.

This year's AMOA Show is being held September 11 through 
September 13 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  All employees who are not
scheduled to attend but wish to attend on their own will be
subsidized by Atari Games up to a maximum of $200 per
employee.  Additionally, in order to attend the show
employees will have to take vacation days with approval by
their department director and/or manager.

Information relevant to the show is listed below.

Date:    September 11-13
Place:   Las Vegas Hilton
Time:    10:00am - 5:00pm Monday/Tuesday
         10:00am - 4:00pm Wednesday

A registration badge is required to get into the show.  Our
company allocation has already been used up so employees will
have to buy a registration card for $50 at the door.

Discount air fare is running approximately $130 round trip,
but seats on these flights are limited.  The Las Vegas Hilton
is fairly booked at this date and may not have any vacancies
available unless reservations have already been made.

In order to be reimbursed for expenses incurred up to a 
maximum of $200, an expense report must be submitted with
valid receipts.

Subj:	Updated gen_eer.asm


	Actually to all game programmers. Others can stop reading and
delete this message.

	OK, I have just fixed some bugs in gen_eer.asm. Truthfully,
I just editted in the bug-fixes I have made over the last year or
so for the games that needed them. I hadn't done this before, because
it's going to require you folks to define a few constants which you
didn't formerly need. But the "official" gen_eer.asm was getting _so_
out of date I decided to bite the bullet. If you re-assemble your
xxx_eer.asm and get error messages, you need to check:

	definition of QSIZE (probably should be 4, but in any case you
		need it to be a power of two and to use it in the DS.L
		that allocates the write queue

	definition of MAXREC (should be 33 for 2804, or 135 for 2816)
		I have heard 2804's are getting scarce, so you should
		at least be _able_ to use 2816's

	definitions of M_HSCT and M_HSCTS. If you don't have them,
		see me or crib them off of someone who does.

	your macro definitions for references to numbers like 33 and $0C,
		which are now represented by MAXREC et al. In particular,
		a MOVEQ.L of 33 cannot safely be changed to a moveq.l
		of MAXREC, since 135 will not fir in a signed byte.

Any other questions, you know where to find me (is your passport valid
for Brazil?)

All of the game graphics, audio, and self-test will be completed by Friday,
9/8.  We intend to release all of the ROM codes as final on 9/8 EXCEPT the
4 program ROMs.  Due to SIGNIFICANT program changes made at the last minute,
we will hold off releasing those four parts until after the AMOA show.
Instead, we will release 4 new pre-prod program ROM parts to accompany the
rest of the RELEASE ROM parts.

We will take a test unit out to San Mateo Gold Mine arcade tomorrow, as well
as updating the Sunnyvale golfland game.  These games will feature the T-shirt
contest.

Artwork is being finished for the T-shirt contest posters, and then the 
T-shirts will be designed.

Yeah, it works fine.  I did ESCAPE on it and it worked great.

As far as how much.  I really don't know.  I know how much it was when
we purchased it but that was 6 or so years ago.  Plus it's out dated.
Although the new LPC chips (at least a few of them)  will still take the
5220 data format.

What do you think it is worth?

It was $25K when we bought it. I know because I was the one who bought it. There
was a big hassle because the way the purchase agreement was originally worded 
it looked like we might not have the rights to the data produced by the unit
and would have to pay $100/word for the words that WE produced.

Shortly after we bought the PASS they came out with a new one using 32010s. They
also laid off the people who did the PASS so there are several features that 
were never finished, like communicating with a host computer.

The first game it was used on was Star Wars which sold 15K units and which I
figured paid for the PASS.

My interest in the unit is mainly sentimental (I bought the VOTRAX system when
it became available a few years ago) so what do you think of $100 ?

Subj:	hard drivin' supercompact

	You had a game out in the common area last week that I hope was
the super-economy test model.  For what it's worth, I think the test failed.
Having a shift lever for drive and neutral (as opposed to high and low,
or drive and park or reverse) is pointless.  "Turn key to start" mapping
to a button is confusing.  No brake pedal is a surprise when you enter the
turn, and the only justification for park or reverse in the gearshift.
The loss of feedback in the steering wheel I realize is an economic decision,
but the fact remains that the game suffers greatly.

	I still find myself frustrated by all versions of the game because of
collisions with oncoming traffic that don't seem justified by the windshield
picture preceding it (two cars entirely on their own side of the yellow line
shouldn't hit each other).  I also feel that when you are off-road (like around
a curve or turn) and driving straight and level with no _apparent_ obstacles,
that crashing and burning is a cop-out.  I realise that the game is a smashing
(sorry) success in general, and in particular with certain individuals here
that are even more critical than I with regards to quality and even realism.
Nonetheless, it is this frustration at things that I don't think should happen
(I admit to being in the minority) that makes me walk away during a game.

	The preceding paragraph is really old news to you and your team, but
the first paragraph is really why I sent this message.  If you wanna make a
super-cheap model for marketing reasons, fine...but please, not that one!

sas

ps:  Even though I get frustrated at the game, I keep playing it...and that is
one of the measures of a game's success...

THEIR LOW POWERED PARTS DO NOT SHOW THIS PROBLEM, BUT I HAVE INCLUDED THEM

IN SETTING UP A TIME FRAME WITH HYUNDAI IN CREDITING OF FIELD FAILURES.

	PURCHASING HAS ALREADY LOCATED ANOTHER VENDOR'S PARTS, SO THESE
SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN-HOUSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

	ON OTHER THING: THE HYUNDAI PART HAS NOTE FAILED IN THE AUDIO

I spent all afternoon in production today primarily because 
they do not have a test procedure. I suggest you generate one 
soon or you will be spending your life over there. The specific 
problems they had involved flight control and monitor 
adjustments. They also had problems with option adjustments. 
Often, they don't know it is a problem, they did not know they

they have to do.

Please have this done on Monday if possible. Let me know the

Subj:	Logg's experimental project


Ed has been considering a variety of ideas for his next project.
Moore/Fujihara/Ray/Downend met with Ed and recommended that he should target
either a low-cost-kit-only "puzzle" game or a premimum high-end game. Based on
that input, Ed asked me 9/18 if he could experiment for a month or two (prior
to official project initiation), with an aerial dog-fight theme with visuals
similar to the Ace of Aces book game. Since Rich previously indicated that a
1-2 month experimental project would be a viable option, I agreed. Ed wanted to
use the Stunrunner hardware since it would allow the quick rendering of the 3D
objects (the artist part) as well as the real-time projection needed for the
experiment. It would also make an excellent hardware for a final product 
targeted at the high-end  segment of the game market.

As of 9/18, Ed is proceeding on the project and has assembled the following:
	- A Stunrunner PCB from Glenn (a spare from AMOA)
	- A bench harness (From the auxilary bench in the STUN lab)
	- A std. res. display.

Ed  talked to Pat McCarthy and arranged for technical assistance from
Farrokh. Ed also talked to Rotberg to help with software in terms of
providing a "shell" extracted from the Stunnrunner program; Ed's intention
was to minimize his demands on Max's time by starting with the Stunrunner
program and to hopefully avoid having to become intimate with the hardware
because of the experimental nature of the project.

Due to the abrupt start of this informal project, Ed and I did not inform Rick
Moncrief. Consequently, the Applied Research team was somewhat dismayed when
Farrokh came requesting information. 

Since then, I talked to Rick Moncrief by phone, and as I understand it, the
Applied Research team will be able to assist Ed and Farrokh to a limited
extent. In particular, Farrokh needs enough information to hook an 8-position
joystick to the hardware. 

Rick and I agreed that the abrupt start of this project resulted in poor
communication for which I apologize. Rick, Ed and I will meet and discuss
the full impact of Ed's project as soon as Rick returns from Idaho.

	I have once again stomped a bug which somehow refuses to die.
If you are an hardware engineer, please consider including a (maskable)
interrupt for "SCOM input empty". See (or write) me for the minimum
requirments. Now, if you are a game programmer, _please_ do not attempt
to circumvent the carefully designed code in snd_com.asm for "speed" reasons
or because "it's too complicated to understand". It's complicated because
the ^&$&*^%*&^ job is complicated. In particular, trash any and all old
copies of the nefarious "keepcom.c" which keeps popping out of its little
corner of code-hell. Any version which does not include the word "reptilian"
in it is BAD BAD BAD. The version in [68k_us] is ok. If you come to me with
a coin or sound problem, and you are using the old one, I will not only
stop working on your problem right then, but I won't come back until
somebody of director or higher rank tells me to. I know this sounds petty,
but this is at least the third time I've had to deal with this, and posted
a note saying "don't do that", and it apparently never penetrates.

	You might notice I haven't said precisely what is wrong with
the non-reptilian keepcom. That's 'cuz I've said it till I was blue in the
face and wanted to save it for last and in all caps:

Dear A__Hole,
               I would like to take the time to thank you for pulling the
wires out of the seat connectors on the two Four Trax games when you moved
them. I'm sure you were way to busy to take the time to check to see if it
was okay to move them. After all, why should you be concerned about the fact
that those were an uncommon connectors, which we do not have replacement parts
for, and now will need to replace with different connectors. Or that the games
are due at a distributor show on Friday, and finally, the few days that the 
games were in-house, were needed to complete a variety of tests to determine 
if we would have any problems selling the games in the U.S. I mean it's not
your responsibility right? So, thanks again, no problem, I can fix the games,
after all I did'nt have anything to do today any way.


                                                                   RLO

In regard of the recent damage to the Four Trax games located next to the
storage cages, the following policy is in effect immediately.

Any game that is not in the common area for player evaluation is not to be
touched. This means that it is not to be played, moved, or anything without the
specific consent of Rick Owens. This applies to games in the back, games in the
labs, or games in storage.

All of the ROM codes have been released for both domestic and European
English language versions.  The game is being built on the line and should
start shipping based upon receiving side-panel graphics and manuals.

Subj:	new phone systems


By now I'm sure you've all read the memo that was sent out a couple of days ago
by Steve Suttles.  If you haven't you should, part of it is regarding the new
way you'll be getting your messages.  From NOW ON, when you have a message you
won't have to worry about it sitting at the front desk too long, or calling me
every hour to see if you have a message, or waiting for someone kind enough to
carry it back to you, and so on...  When you pick up your phone wait a second
and listen to your dial tone, if there's a pause in your dial tone that means
YOU WON THE BIG PRIZE... Ha Ha!!  Or just that you have a message waiting at
the front desk for you.  Now, you will be responsible to check your dial tone
for that pause.  If you don't and you've had a message up here that you've been
waiting for, don't blame me!!  I'm sure the company spent alot of money
upgrading the system, and you can bet I'm gonna use it.  So please don't take
ANY messages off my desk unless you let me know, otherwise I won't know to turn
the message waiting signal OFF of that persons phone, and you can see the
problems and wasted time that can cause.  Thank You very much!  Steph

Tom Smith reports that the EPROM market is soft which means prices have
dropping for the last 2-3 months. He further reports that the trend seems
to be for them to drop more. Here are the current prices:

	27C512-200 (137448-200) $5.70
	27C512-250 (137448-250) $4.50

Subj:	Yet Another EEPROM Bug


	Deck found a bug in the new gen_eer.asm, which has in fact been
there for quite some time. Anyway, If you are including gen_eer.asm from
[68k_us], you should re-assemble it. If you have a private, modified copy,
you should change the three lines centered on the label "cs10:" to be:

	MOVE.L	#EER_LOG-1,D2		* error log is first non-cleared stat
CS10:	CLR.L	-(SP)			* value = 0
	MOVE.L	D2,-(SP)		* statcode


	You will also need to define EER_LOG in your xxx_eer.asm (the file
that includes gen_eer.asm). It will probably be 10 (decimal), but in any case
should be whatever it is in your eerdefs.h file.

	For reference, If your gen_eer.asm is so old that the next line is
_not_
	BSR	eer_puts

	...you don't have this particular bug, but you have so many others that
you are in deep trouble already and I wouldn't sweat the thunder-showers.

					Sorry,

	If you don't work with either SciDesign schematics or Abel, this doesn't
apply to you. If you do use these facilities, I have created a couple of command
procedures which may be of interest to you. 

EE$USERDISK:[HUBBERSTEY.CAETOOLS]ABEL.COM - This procedure wil run the Abel PLD
compiler for you with a few added features over the standard procedure in
ABELEXE:ABEL.COM. 
      - It remembers the previous command line and will re-execute it if
	invoked with no parameters. 
      - It only runs simulation if specified by a command-line flag, /S.
      - It chooses "Presto by pin" reduction (-R3) if not specified otherwise.
      - It will submit the FUSEMAP and SIMULATE executions to a Microvax II
	batch queue if you are not logged onto one. 
      - It provides online help for ALL those pesky command-line flags by
	invoking with ? as the first parameter. 
The only restriction is that it must be run with a symbol defined by the
following command line or strange things will happen: 
ABEL :== @EE$USERDISK:[HUBBERSTEY.CAETOOLS]ABEL


EE$USERDISK:[HUBBERSTEY.CAETOOLS]SCIDXREF.COM - This procedure will generate a
cross-reference list of all tag names in a set of SciDesign schematic sheets as
well as a list of all tags referenced only once and, optionally, a list of the
number of times each tag is used. This is intended mainly as a utility for
generating node-name cross-reference lists but can be used for other things,
such as figuring approximate bus loading (how many times is D0 used, for
instance), locating components on back-annotated schematics (what sheet is R6
on?) and whatever else you can think of. It provides online help by invoking
with ? as the first parameter. 


	Feel free to use these or hijack portions for your own purposes.

Subj:	RADMOD update


RADMOD update:			9/25/89

NEW features:
* reads the Macintosh PICT2 32 bit deep format.  This means you can
	use some of the new rendering programs to produce images which you
	can use in your games.
* using the new features described next, you can take a series of different
  files and combine them into one RAD file with the optimum palette.
  This process requires 2 passes:
   1st pass: send all the pictures you want in the final RAD file
	through RADMOD's palette analyzer (PALA function).
        At the end of this pass, you create a palette file optimized for all 
	the pictures you've just passed through 
	(OUTT to 'plt' format, then COPY).
   2nd pass: send all the pictures through RADMOD again, except this time you
	force them to use the palette you just created (COPY function, then
	answer the palette question by indicating you want to use that
	palette you just created).
* PALA: analyze palettes.  This allows you to pass several files through 
  RADMOD to get their palette/color usage analyzed.  When you've analyzed
  all your files, you can create and save the best palette for all these files
  by setting the output file type to "plt" (see next new feature) and then
  selecting the "COPY" menu option.
* outputs a RAD type palette file.  Select OUTT menu option (Set Output File 
  Type) and enter "plt".  Then select COPY menu option.  It will output a RAD
  type 256 color palette.
* allows you to force a picture to use a specified palette.  This function is
  available when you're reducing down from 32,24,or 16 bits.  You get a
  set of options when you're converting down from these bigbit files:
   > create best palette for this picture?
   > get palette from a file and use it?   
   > use current output palette?
  If you select option 2, you'll be asked for the file from which to get the
  palette.  Theoretically, you can enter the name of any file containing a 
  palette and it will go in and get the palette.  The only file type tested so
  far is the new "plt" (raw palette file) format. (Rad files for sure don't
  work yet).
  If you've already done one picture and selected option 2, then the next
  picture you do you can answer with option 3. This is much quicker then #2.
  You will be asked whether or not you want to dither to the final palette.
* some rather obscure options have been added:
  > when dithering, you can now (optionally) specify transparent color(s) 
    which, of course, won't be dithered.  You specify the index of the main
    transparent color, and you can also specify another range of colors which
    are to be remapped to the main transparent color.  If you're good, you can 
    use this method to cookie cutter your object.  What you do is place the
    extra range of colors to be mapped to the one final transparent color after
    the final actually used colors in the palette.
  > when creating the ultimate palette, you can (optionally) specify the minimum
    # of pixels (as a number or as a percentage of the total # of pixels)
    using a color in the palette for it to exist.  This one can really screw up
    your palette if you're not careful.
* scale now works on the original 15 bit image before it reduces to 8 bits, so
  you get higher quality scaling.
* the page/cel mode is now specified explicitly in the cel choice selection.

For your protection, I have placed a copy of the previous version of RADMOD
into [theurer.pps]radmod911.exe, in case you have problems with the new version.

Subj:	Cyber Secrets Revealed


Our Cyberball Sequel has created confusion regarding names for the 5 versions.
Here is a SIMPLE way to refer to them - it's already used by most people: 

 1) 2-Screen Whole Game	       (These are the new games we built in August)
 2) 1-Screen Whole Game	       (These are the new games we built in September)
 3) 2-Screen Retro Kit	       (Converts a 2-screen original Cyberball)
 4) 1-Screen Universal Kit     (Converts any one-screen cabinet)
 5) VS Dual Kit		       (Converts Nintendo VS Dual to 2-screen Cyberball)

The official name of the project is Cyberball 2072... 2072 is 50 years after
Cyberball started as a sport in 2022 for you sport fans and trivia addicts.

I released new versions of MAC65, MACAS, MAC68K and MACPP. These versions
have had a couple of bugs fixed in the "truncation" and "branch offset
out of range" error messages. It now correctly reports the location.
They also report the line number and filename of the line that caused
the error and they no longer produce an output object file if there were
assembly errors.

The MSDOS version of MAC65 will be available next week.

There has been a new release of the European version of the game.  The -30
program parts represent a MINOR update of the program that was inadvertantly
left out in the -20 program parts.  There were only two changes to the code:
	1) Improved the algorithm to read the controls during initial entry
	   into the High_score tables.
	2) Fixed the program so that the "boost shadow" was visible when
	   first entering boost.

Neither of these changes affect the game play.  The first 100 board sets
shipped to Eire were stuffed with the -20 parts.  However a -30 set of
program ROMs was also sent with the shipment along with a note detailing
the changes involved and giving them the option to make the update to those
100 boards if they wish.

	After testing 100 low power SRAM'S from Hyundai and running 16
	of them for 45 hours at 80`C with no failures, I am willing to
	re-instate Hyundai's low power SRAM's back into part number
	137535-XXX. The Hyundai part can be used for all boards. Also,
	these 100 pieces have been identified by a sticker that states
	"COMPONENT ENG EVALUATION SRAM". If these parts fail out in the
	field I hope that they will be return to Component Engineering
	for evaluation.

	I will issue a CER adding Hyundai's part number HY6264LP's to the
	appropriate dash number for our part number 137535-XXX. any Hyundai
	low power parts being held in MRB should be transfered back into
	inventory.

	Thanks for all the help is gratefully given to JED and MANUFACTURING

Subj:	MTO procedure


I talked to Tom Smith and Rob Bryant about the MTO procedure, 
and this is what we decided:

When filling out the MTO form, the time boxes on the lower 
right corner are the time the STOCKROOM will adhere to. Before 
the stockroom can issue a part, the planners have to sign the 
form (to make sure they can cover production requirements, 
etc.). 

Normal procedure:

Fill out the MTO and drop it in the box that has been installed near 
Rob Bryant's office. A planner will process the form and take it to 
the stockroom (or call you) within 24 hours.

The stockroom will process the form as indicated on the lower 
right corner and call you when the parts are ready.

Emergency procedure:

If you were unable to plan for the part, and you have to have 
it right away, you need to find a planner and ask them to sign 
the MTO while you wait. Then carry the MTO to the stockroom and 
it will be processed as indicated in the lower right corner.

NOTE:
If the parts are not in stock, or if they need to be built up, 
the time it takes to fill the MTO will naturally be longer.

You should attempt to let the planners know (when a game is 
released) if you will be needing any production PCBs. It is not 
cost-effective to keep lots of extra boards in inventory. In 
general, give as much warning as possible for game or audio PCBs.

Please let Tom Smith or Rob Bryant know if you have any inputs 
on this process.

Thanks!!

John

Subj:	Memo from Bob Sheffield -- NEW FOOTBALL POOL


If you are a football fan, please join us in a new football pool.
The way it works is very simple.  Pick the winners of 20 games 
each weekend -- 14 pro and 6 collegiate -- and the total score of
the Monday nite game.

The persons with the highest number of correct picks will split
the pot -- 50% to first place, 30% to second place, and 20% to 
third place.  In case of ties, the tie breaker will be the 
closest pick to the total score of the Monday nite game.

Assuming we get at least 15 people to play each weekend, we keep
the pool going.

Please turn in your $3 and football picks to Bob Sheffield or
Carol Jackson in Finance.

There has been a new release of the both the domestic and European versions of
the game.  These are the -31 and -40 parts respectively and only affect the
four program ROMs (i.e. 3103, 3104, 3105, 3106).  The update fixes an obscure
bug which could prevent a legitimate high score from being entered on the high
score table if that player failed to make the Ultimate Challenge mini-high score
table but had a high enough score to qualify for the overall high score table.

There have been 3 ECNs to change all of the parts that were specified as EPROMs
to OTPs with the execption of the four program parts.

Subj:	Take this (Print) Job and...


I'd like to thank the person (A__Hole again probably) who was kind enough to 
bring the AVL month-end report to my office this morning as a shredded mess.
Had they left it alone in the printer room then perhaps I could have saved it,
but now I've no choice except to start it all over again.  So those of you
wishing to use TTQ1 this morning had better look first before queing your job
up...it might be awhile.  Oh and by-the-way A__Hole, perhaps someday I can
arrange for your job to be just a little bit harder, and maybe you'll find
something wet and nasty in your printouts.

Subj:	JUNK EMAIL:  public forum,  or public flogging?


I'm frankly disturbed by several messages that have occurred lately.
I'm referring to mail messages that condemn the actions of others, in front
of fellow workers, in an unprofessional manner.  I believe that JUNK EMAIL
is a priviledged forum where we can speak our mind on personal views regarding
any subject.  Not a place to ridicule others.

If you have a different view, I'd like to hear it, but please send it to
@SYS$MAIL:JUNK for all to read.

	My apologies to the world at large, I am the culprit who got Jeff so
pissed off.  Now you've been forced to witness the text of my public flogging,
so my crime is multiplied several times.  I am shamed, humiliated.

	To resolve my problems, and now yours, I've admitted my guilt
personally to Jeff, and endured his righteous wrath.  To redress my
transgressions on the junk mail circuit, I publicly and humbly (I'm
typing on bended knee) beg your indulgence and forgiveness for this
seemingly endless parade of scandalous missives.  In the infamous words
of Agent 86, "Sorry about that, chiefy".

	By the way, Jeff & I kissed and made up.

	How come everybody accuses & complains on junk mail, but I'm the first
admission of guilt?

	Reading junk mail is even better than watching a soap opera, huh?

	And with that thought, I close (How come my knee hurts?   Oh, yeah).

	I agree with you . Junk mail is indeed a sacred forum that 
we should all respect. Use it but don't abuse it. I can appreciate those 
times when we get so steamed and find this forum as a healthy outlet for 
our anger. But we can air our frustrations more maturely. 
	I happened to see the mess in the printer room yesterday before
Steve cleaned it up. While Jeff would have been happier to find his
print out spread all over the printer room, others had to suffer.
	Harsh words are powerful tools when used sparingly ,but redundant
when abused. Lets not loose control and call people ___ ____ ... aimlessly.

Subj:	Interesting quote


	Rather than continue the developing tradition of flame-fests
on JUNK, I'd like to return to the origianl purpose of sharing possibly
useful information (sorry if this offends some of you). To wit, the
following quote form "The Psychology of Computer Programming",
by Gerald Weinberg. Discussing the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Pesonality
Inventory) as a tool for selecting from among job applicants, Weinberg
notes that the MMPI was derived from a study of institutionalized psychotics,
and continues:

	"Naturally, we feel that mentally ill people are not what we are
	 looking for when we hire programmers -- although there are no
	 empirical data to support or contradict that view"

				Well, _I_ found it interesting...

Subj:	Please don't announce game names on the page system


It is not a good idea to announce game names on the PA system. 
There are often vendors, guests, etc. in our building that 
should not be informed about our future games. Some names are 
descriptive enough that they could actually gain information: 
Tetris, Battle Sprint, Hydra, etc.

Instead, you could use the project leader's name ("Logg's review 
is now starting"), the name of the location ("Ed, please come 
to the Alpha labs"), etc.

Thanks!!

John

Jed,
	I got the scoop from Leon on what happened and how the 
34010 could be correctly connected but the stuff on my board was wrong.  
The 34010 shape was called pga68 so when Leon needed a 68 plcc he couldn't 
find one and created a new shape which had some errors.  I didn't ask to 
have that shape proofed because I thought is was old and proven since 
I thought you had already use it.

John, I received the PO for 250 Stuns from Namco today and was alarmed
to see their footnote for 100v, 50-60Hz  specification.  

This is the first I've heard this request and perhaps they're assuming
we should automatically do this since we are asking them to convert to
our specs. for Four Trax.  I am bothered that they have not mentioned
it earlier, as we promised delivery dates based on current schedule.
I will confirm with Hide that we need to comply with this request.

In the meantime, can you check what it will take to accomodate their
request...have parts lists reviewed to see what cost/lead time issues
will we be dealing with.  

I've mentioned this to Bob Stewart also.  Once I hear from Hide (probably
by tonight), I will get back with you.  

Thanks, Mary

Subj:	FIRST STRIKE


In June of 1987 Katya Komisaruk took a crowbar, cordless drill, and
a hammer and broke into a NAVSTAR ground control station at 
Vandenberg AFB.  Leaving a note, flowers, and a box of cookies for the
troops she expected at any moment, she dismantled the control computer
and damaged the tracking antenna for this highly accurate military
sattelite navigation system.  In an amazing display of luck and government
incompetence she worked for more than 2 hours without interruption, 
spray painting her justification for her actions inside and outside
the building. She then left, hitchhiked to San Francisco, and held a
news conference explaining what she did and why.

The Navstar navigation sattelites are part of a global network of
sattelites which together form the Global Positioning System, or
GPS.  Using GPS in its full encrypted millitary mode a submarine,
airplane, or nuclear warhead can determine its position and altitude
to an accuracy of better than 50 feet anywhere on the surface of the earth.
This may seem innocuous, but that sort of accuracy turns submarine launced
balistic missiles such as the TRIDENT into first strike weapons.

The TRIDENT and other missile carrying submarines were sold to the American
public as an invulnerable deterrent to soviet nuclear attack.  Since
the soviets would have no way of finding and destroying these subs if
THEY strike first (the argument goes), the soviets would be sure that
if they attacked us with nuclear weapons they would be destroyed.
Thus (so we were told) the TRIDENT system helps prevent nuclear war.

If you give the TRIDENT missile 50 foot accuracy the whole picture changes.
With this sort of accuracy the United States can use submarine launched
missiles to attack first and destroy land based soviet missiles and bombers.
(To destroy a hardened missile silo a nuclear blast must be close enough to
include the silo in the crater from the explosion).  From a position off the
coast of the USSR a TRIDENT multiple warhead missile could destroy its
targets in as little as SIX MINUTES rather than the half hour or so
that a US land based missile will take to reach its target.
This combination of accuracy and speed has caused experts to label the
combination of TRIDENT and NAVSTAR the ultimate first strike weapon.

Having this sort of capability makes nuclear war much MORE LIKELY in
two ways:
1.  If the US perceives it has the capability to destroy the 
soviet nuclear arsenal on the ground it will be much more likely
to start a nuclear exchange in time of crisis.  Having a partially
functional STAR WARS system to absorb a weakened soviet nuclear response
makes a US first strike even more likely.
2.  The Soviet Union will know that it has only six minutes from
warning of a US submarine launched first strike until it starts to
lose its capability for nuclear retalliation.  Put yourself in the
position of a soviet general recieving a warning from your
launch detector systems that such an attack is in progress.  You only
have SIX MINUTES to determine if this warning is real or due to
some sort of malfunction!  If you wait for the bombs to start exploding
it will be too late!!! You can't find the premier that fast, he's on
a hunting trip in Soviet Georgia!!!! I don't know about you, but I 
don't want to have the survival of the planet so dependent on the 
reliability of soviet attack detection technology.

Katya destroyed the NAVSTAR ground station to take direct action against
this threat to our planet and to make public the connection between
NAVSTAR, TRIDENT and a US first strike capability.  She was arrested
after the news conference by the FBI.  Her defense was to rest on the
nurenberg principles (which oblige citizens to resist genocidal actions
by their own governments) and international law (which outlaws preparations
for wars of agression).  Due to legal manuvering by the US attorney and
the judge, she was not allowed to present her defense.  She was not
allowed to detail her reasons for her actions at the trial, or
say anything about first strike or nuclear weapons.  She was not allowed
to present her witnesses on nuclear strategy or international law.
The jury was even prevented from seeing photographs of the NAVSTAR
building or equipment because they contained Katya's spray painted
justification for her actions.  She is now serving a long sentence in
federal prison, having been denied a fair trial.

I met Katya at an anti-nuclear rally in Mountain View a few days before
her trial.  She is a remarkable person, obviously quite brave as well
as very warm and friendly.  I have a video tape about her and her
actions titled FIRST STRIKE: PORTRAIT OF AN ACTIVIST.  This tape has
just been completed by an indepenent filmmaker, and does an excellent
job of detailing a story which has been all but ignored by the US media.
Anyone interested can borrow it, and if people want I will show it during
lunch sometime.

Due to a lot of interest in the movie FIRST STRIKE: PORTRAIT OF
AN ACTIVIST, I will be showing it next Wednsday, Nov 1 in the 
central conference room.  If you missed the previous message this is
a movie about Katya Komisaruk and her action to destroy a control
computer for the NAVSTAR military navigation system.  Showtime is
12:00 and the movie is slightly less than an hour long.  If we have time
afterwards maybe we can discuss some of the issues raised in the
film.

See you Wednsday,

Subj:	EEPROM usage.


We are phasing out 2804 EEPROMS (512x8) and phasing in 2816 
EEPROMS (2Kx8). The old 2804-450 from XICOR cost $4.50. The 
2816-300 (from SAMSUNG I think) costs $2.25. This should be 
reverse compatable with all old designs, since as far as I 
know all boards were laid out to accept 2816s even though 
we used 2804s. 
So you now have 4 times as much non volatile storage at 
half the price.
Use Atari part number 137399-300.

			The approximate date it was sent.
			When it was placed for pickup.
 Please give me as much info as you can, altho I do not expect all of the

Abstract:
	This study examined the incidence of neckwear tightness among a group
of 94 white-collar working men and the effect of a tight business-shirt collar
and tie on the visual performance of 22 male subjects.  Of the white-collar
men measured, 67% were found to be wearing neckwear that was tighter than
their neck circumference.  The visual discrimination of the 22 subjects was
evaluated using a critical flicker frequency (CFF) test.  Results of the CFF
test indicated that tight neckwear significantly decreased the visual
performance of the subjects and that visual performance did not improve
immediately when tight neckwear was removed.

Subj:	Zmodem file transfer now available


The vax now supports file transfers using the ZMODEM protocol.  ZMODEM, for
those who never heard of it, is a very quick, very reliable file transfer
protocol.  The main highlights of this protocol are:

	o Faster than XMODEM, YMODEM and KERMIT.
	o Automatically sends file names so you don't have to tell the 
	  receiver what it's receiving.
	o Automatically starts the file transfer process (when transferring
	  to a ZMODEM compatible terminal emulator.
	o Can resume an interrupted transfer right where it left off.
	o Will do translations of CR-LF's so text files appear OK.

To use this protocol, 2 programs are available; RZ (for receive Zmodem) and
SZ (for Send Zmodem).

The format for sending files from the VAX is

	SZ [-y] file1 file2 ...

The optional -y tells ZMODEM to overwrite the destination file.  As yet, SZ
does not understand wildcards, so SZ *.C won't work.  There are other options
that you'll probably never need, but if you type SZ by itself, it will list
them for you.

The receiving end (if it knows ZMODEM) will automatically start receiving the
file.

For uploading files to the VAX, use 

     	RZ [-yn]

to start the VAX listening, then start sending the files from your terminal
emulator however it requires.

The option -y tells ZMODEM to overwrite destination files.  The -n option
tells ZMODEM to translate carriage returns to newlines and to receive a text
file.  Again there are other options, and by typing RZ -help, they will be
displayed.

There are some documentation files that go into more detail, but if you're not
a UNIX weenie they might not be much help beyond describing the options.  The
help files are named DOK:RZ.MAN and DOK:SZ.MAN.  (Yes, these programs are
ports from the original UNIX source).

SZ and RZ have both been defined in the system-wide login file, so you don't
need to set them up in your LOGIN.COM files.

If you have any other questions, let me know.  I will endeavor to stick in wild
card smarts when I get the chance, but unless I hear otherwise, it's not a high
priority.

Subj:	Changes to DIO


A new Family/Pin code selection program is in beta test at the DIO's.
It has substantial differences than the old one:

1) It is a complete new program written in C (the old one was written
	in VAX assembly...a real pain in the ass to maintain).
2) It allows for each part to have 3 F/P codes: a primary, a secondary
	and a Unipak. The Unipak code is required because some parts
	have different F/P codes between the model 288 and model 29.
3) It allows for you to type in the F/P code instead of a device type
	if that's all you know, or the device isn't in the F/P table.
4) It allows for you to add (or change) devices in the F/P table.

Item 4 isn't enabled just yet.

The reason for the primary and secondary F/P codes is: The model 288 has new
firmware that has two sets of F/P codes for selected EPROMS using different
programming algorithms for each. Specifically the TI 27512's can use "snap
programming" which is supposed to be several times faster than the other method.
The model 29 doesn't have this feature and currently only 1 of the 288's has the
new firmware. So...the family pin selector will send the primary F/P code
and if the DIO rejects it, will then send the secondary. It'll only send the
Unipak F/P code if it knows it is sending to the Model 29 with the Unipak
installed AND the Unipak F/P code is not 0.

In order not to break other stuff, I've added a new command to DIO which
selects this new family pin code selector program: FAMILY. Use FAMILY instead
of DEVICE if you want to try out the new code. The only differences between
the FAMILY and DEVICE commands are:

	FAMILY doesn't require an argument. If you type FAMILY with no
	argument, it does auto-family_pin selection. If you type FAMILY
	with a device name that isn't in the F/P table, it reports same
	then does an auto-family_pin selection (same as DEVICE would do).

	If the argument to FAMILY begins with a minus sign (-), then the
	argument is assumed to be a family-pin code and will be sent to
	the DIO (sans minus sign). It'll report if the DIO didn't like
	the F/P code. It'll also report what devices are in the F/P table
	that have a matching F/P code.

If after a while, this program seems to work without trouble, I'll make
DEVICE use it too.

Re: A Stun Runner Problem


This is a strange problem. Does it happen alot? Does it happen on Hard Drivin'
or Compact Hard Drivin' ? 

This is what I would do if I thought it was a hardware problem:

  1. Check that the +5V is +5.00V. Use an accurate meter (not a 'scope)
     and measure it on the MultiSync board.

     Just for grins, you might also try it at 4.80V and 5.20V (but return it 
     to 5.00V when you are done).

  2. Try the VRAM Verify Test in the GSP Test Screen. 

     You can also try the VRAM Verify Diagnostic Test. This will continuously 
     perform the VRAM Verify test and log any errors. Run it for an hour or two.

     To run it:

	1. Jumper the DIAGN test point to GND;
	2. Set the DIP Switch to  0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ;
	3. Momentarily jumper the RESET Test Point to GND.

     To get out of Diagnostics:

	1. Remove the jumper from the DIAGN test point;
	2. Momentarily jumper the RESET Test Point to GND;
	3. It is probably a good idea to return the DIP Switch to 
	   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .

     You might also try the Program ROM Diagnostic Test Loop 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
     and the Program RAM Diagnostic Test Loop X X 1 0 0 0 1 1 . (The RAM Test 
     Loop bashes part of zeropower RAM.) To run these test follow the 
     instructions for the VRAM Verify Diagnostic Test but use the above DIP 
     Switch settings.

     Since the Program RAM Diagnostic Test bashes part of the ZeroPower RAM it
     might confuse the Game Stats and High Score program and you may need to 
     take decisive action to restore its normal function. This is acomplished 
     by resetting the board DURING the ZeroPower RAM test. (This totally bashes
     the ZeroPower RAM contents and the program knows how to deal with it.)


  3. Run the new ADSP II memory tests:

     Go to the SPECIAL FUNCTIONS screen and select ADSP BOARD TESTS.

     Run:

	ADSP RAM .TESTED BY 68010.
	ADSP PROGRAM MEMORY TEST .2100
	ADSP DATA MEMORY TEST .2100
	2100 TEST
	IRQ TEST
	ROM CHECKSUMS (verify that the checksums are correct)

     Select the ADSP SPECIAL FUNCTIONS screen

     Run:

	SEQ OUTPUT BUFFER CONTROL CHECK (It should put up some numbers and say 
					 BUFFER CONTROL .BCON. OK )

	Select SEQ OUTPUT BUFFER 1 TESTS and run 
	TEST BUFFER. DATA = ADDRESS .68010 (It should run continuously without
	reporting any errors. If it reports any error the 8Kx8 RAMs on the ADSP
	board are bad.)

	Press start to return to SEQ OUTPUT BUFFER 1 TESTS and Select EXIT.
  	This will return you to the ADSP SPECIAL FUNCTIONS screen.

	TEST BUFFER. DATA = ADDRESS .68010 (It should run continuously without
	reporting any errors. If it reports any error the 8Kx8 RAMs on the ADSP
	board are bad.)

	You can run the other tests, too, if you want.

  4. Even if the ADSP II passes these tests you might try substituting a known
     good ADSP II board. If that fixes the problem you have a bad ADSP II board.

    If you do, look at the 8Kx8 RAMs at 1 A/B, 3 A/B, 1H, and 3H. If you have
    Hyundai HY6264P-__ RAMs remove them, install sockets, and install Hyudai
    HY6264LP-__. These are low power parts that are supposed to work. You
    can also use 8Kx8 RAMs from another manufacturer.

  5. Let me know what you find.

Subj:	DIO F/P codes

As mentioned last week, a new family/pin code selector program has installed in
the DIO procedure. It has a feature to add/change family/pin codes in the
database so you can help with the F/P maintenance. To use this feature type ADD
to the DIO_COMMAND prompt. The system will repeatedly prompt for a device name,
a vendor name, and the 3 F/P codes. As many may be input as you like.
Most of the devices will only need a primary F/P code. You can enter 0 (or
simply return) for the secondary and Unipak F/P codes unless the DIO chart
says otherwise.

The values appearing in brackets ([]'s) are default values which will be used if
nothing is input for the parameter. Typing 0's for all 3 F/P codes will cause
the program to ignore the entry. A null device name terminates the session
and installs the changes. F/P codes are not sent to the DIO by the ADD
command.

If you type a device/vendor combination that is already in the F/P tables, it'll
print out the old entry above the new entry and ask if you want to R(eplace) 
the old with the new, D(elete) the old one or Q(uit) to ignore the new entry.

The primary F/P code will be sent to the DIO first. If the DIO rejects it,
the secondary (if any) will be sent. If the DIO rejects that, an error message
will be displayed. The Unipak F/P code will only be sent if the program
knows it's running the Model 29 with a Unipak installed and the Unipak code
is not 0.

Subj:	[UTILITIES...] moved


I've been have a great deal of trouble maintaining correct versions of
the utility programs on all the systems. In order to remove this as
a problem, I moved the utilities directories to a cluster common
disk yesterday. I was under the mistaken impression that everybody
had been using the logical names UTL$COM and UTL$EXE to reach the
programs since we'd enabled those names about 7 years ago which would
have made this move transparent to everybody.

If in your *.COM files you have assigned your own private logicals
to SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES...], you will find they won't work anymore.
You will need to replace all of them to:

	SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.COM]	-> UTL$COM:
	SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES.EXE]	-> UTL$EXE:
	SYS$SYSDEVICE:[UTILITIES]	-> UTL$MAC:

You may use the GSR (Global Search and Replace) procedure to fix them
all if you like:

	$ SET DEFAULT SYS$LOGIN		!go to your home directory
	$ GSR [...]*.COM		!edit all .COM files

It'll ask for the search string to which you reply with one of the
above strings. Type return to the next 2 prompts (No and No) then
type the appropriate substitution string to the 3rd prompt. You'll
need to do this once for each string to change (there's probably
no UTL$MAC references anywhere, so you might be able to skip that one).

Sorry for any inconvience this may have caused anyone.

Sales & marketing are considering doing a Japanese version of the game.  My
best estimation is that it will take from 1 to 2 weeks to implement the
changes necessary to add the Kanji (and possibly Japanese voice cues) to the
game.

Subj:	GALs in production.


Watch those GALs...at the RACES.

Three times now I have come up against timing problems with GALs on
production game boards. The problem ? The GALs are too fast compared to
pals. I am comparing 25nS GALs to 25nS PALs. 

The senario is that a PAL is used to generate some timing signals. In all
cases so far the development boards used PALs because we hadn't started
using GALs yet. Come production release time we call out GALs because thats
what we do these days. 
Then manufacturing calls in with problems. (Meantime the responsible
engineers have vanished.) 
The problem is caused because the design relied upon a minimum delay
through the PAL. But the GALs are faster than the PALs and so are not
providing the same delay. So we have a classic race condition. 

It is worth noting that the problems were voltage dependent. This is most 
likely due to the fact that GALs are CMOS devices, while PALs are bipolar 
devices. (Remember when CMOS used to be SLOWER than bipolar.)

Bottom line. Test your GAL circuits at 5.25 volts cold and 4.75 volts hot 
to check for race conditions at both ends of the performance spectrum.

								Pat.

Subj:	RACE CONDITIONS


I hesitate to send this message since, considering how the universe works,
I'm probably cursing myself to be bitten by a race condition. HOWEVER...

	The implications of Pat's message was that it was O.K. to depend on
minimum delays as long as you test your circuit with the same parts as used
in production. (Pat- I realize you may not have meant to convey that 
impression.) I believe that unless a minimum delay is SPECIFICALLY mentioned
in the data book it is a grave mistake to rely on delays. It is especially
easy to fall into this trap here at Atari since we all know that tolerating
some "benign" race conditions can save some money in the form of registers
you don't need to resynchronize your signals. Tolerating races is addictive
and slowly erodes your standards of what constitutes good design the more
times you get away with it. I know I'm running this into the ground but please

I apologize for not unprotecting the directory. It is now accessible.

The program is contained in 

	GSPTST.ASM	main program

	MSGS.ASM	messages

	CHARS.ASM	character font and character routines

Note: All test patterns and messages are written into the bit map by the
host processor; these test programs do not use the 34010's processing power.

The basic plan is:

	1. Set up the 34010 display, control, and sync registers (for external
	   sync);
	   
	2. Write into the screen memory. (It will appear on the screen.)

1. Move C89 (0.1 uF) to near R43 so it will be between C91 and the circuitry
   it powers.

2. The +12V line from 80L pin 4 should go separately to +12V at C90.
   Make this a heavy trace where possible.

3. Make the -12V line a heavy trace where possible. 

4. Add "APPLIED RESEARCH" to the trace layer.

5. Add pin "1" to silkscreen for JSPK, J1, J3, JSERA, and JSERB.

6. Add to 2101 silkscreen the orientations for PLCC and PGA.

An IBM PC Clone has been brought into the STUN lab so that the installation
of the Japanese fonts can be done.  Mary Fujihara has informed that the
translations of the agreed upon text has also been done, but it will need to
be edited into a Macintosh for inclusion into the program.

Anne Hayes has given us a spec for a Taiwanese chasis and color monitor that
Entropy Intl. wants to use with a STUN Runner kit (didn't know there was such
a beast!!).  THis has been forward first to Jed, and then to Rick Meyette to
determine if our kit (??) will drive their equipment.  I have no further
information on the status of this at this time.

Morgan,

	The original functional requirements were:

   1. Be cheap;

   2. Be able to put up a cursor and some characters in a 640 x 480 format with
      two bits/pixel;

   3. Be cheap;

   4. Accept external sync from the video board;

   5. Be cheap;


The minimum number of VRAMs in a system is four, so four is what was used.

This produces a single buffer with 8K Bytes (contiguous) VRAM available for 
34010 program.

There is 45K Bytes also available but it is non-contiguous consisting of 
96 Bytes every 256 Bytes (until the contiguous part is reached).

Using the 45K Bytes for program would mean not being able to use the fast
screen clear mode. Fast screen clear would be able to clear (or set) the screen
in less than 100 us.

In a completely unexpected move today, Charles Babbage, creator of the
"Babbage Numerator", widely recognized to be the prototypical computer,
announced that he and his heirs will be suing all makers of computer
equipment, computer peripherals, computer-driven equipment (cars, 
microwave ovens, etc) for royalty fees retroactive to December 1, 1880.

The basis for the suit is quoted: "All computers ever produced since mine
are unlicensed derivative works, and they infringe upon my copyright of
presentation appearance which I placed on the Numerator."

In a related news item, Ada Lovelace, Babbage's live-in girlfriend,
is filing a suit against all programmers, claiming that they have unlawfully
profited from her work.

Since the mail lists RAINSGANG and VANGANG didn't seem to reflect
the current organization, I merged them into a new one: MOOREGANG.

The mail lists RAINSGANG, VANGANG and MOORETEAM no longer exist.

FYI: Here's a list of some of the more commonly used lists:

	EVERYBODY - Everyone who has an account on any system.
		(Use of this list is reserved for special events).
	JUNK - same as EVERYBODY except no project accounts, 
		Hoff or Moncrief.
	ENGINEER - Everyone in 675 except ADMIN, FINANCE and HR.
	MARKETING - Market research (Mary's group).
	ANIMATORS - All the animators.
	EE - 	Electrical Engineering (except ANIMATORS).
	MOOREGANG - everyone in ENGINEER except MARKETING.

Less commonly used, probably because you didn't know about them.

	ADMIN - Administration.
	CUSTSVC - Customer Service.
	FACILITIES - Facilities.
	FINANCE - A/P, A/R and other Finance individuals.
	HR - Human Resources.
	MFG - All of manufacturing (everyone in 735).

You can get a list of mail distribution lists with a

	$ DIR SYS$MAIL:*.DIS;

and you can find who is on what list with one of the following:

	$ SEAR SYS$MAIL:*.DIS; username_to_find
or
	$ TYPE SYS$MAIL:whatever.DIS

Subj:	Ring, ring, ring goes the trolley...


We've been having some trouble with the computer room fire sensors triggering
false alarms recently. When this happens, the red bell in the main corridor
rings and it is rather loud. I'm sure you will notice it if it happens and
you'll want it to stop. 

So, if there's another false alarm and the bell starts ringing and I'm not
here (it always seems to happen in the middle of the night), here is how to
make it stop:

Inside the printer room there is a panel on the wall behind the door (you'll
have to close the printer room door to get to it). Open the panel (there's a key
in the lock in the panel door) and you'll see a row of toggle switches. One is
marked "Alarm silence". Turn that switch off (down) and the bell should stop
ringing. An annoying little "beeper" inside the panel will begin sounding when
the alarm is silenced, so you can shut that up by turning off the "Trouble
silence" switch. PLEASE DON'T FLIP ANY OTHER SWITCHES. We hope to be able to
determine which sensor is causing the trouble from the array of LED's which will
remain lit after all that. Close the panel and leave a note on my door or send
VAXmail to SHEPPERD.

Sorry for any inconvience and thanks for your patience.

What if it is ringing because there is a real fire?

Then it won't matter what you do. The horn will go off, the Halon will
dump, the HVAC and power to the computers and phones will turn off and
(which, btw, will turn off the alarms). In that event, you might as well
go home.
